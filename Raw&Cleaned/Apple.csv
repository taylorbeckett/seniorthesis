Tim Cook
 
Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us, 
especially those of you listening in on our new noise
-
cancelling AirPods Pro 
which are available beginning today.
 
Th
is was Apple's highest revenue in a September quarter ever, and I want to 
take you through some of the highlights before we get into greater detail on 
the conclusion of a remarkable fiscal 2019 for Apple.
 
We achieved revenue of $64 billion in the quarter a
t the high end of our 
expectations, even in spite of a predicted foreign exchange drag of almost 
$1 billion. Geographically, we set new Q4 revenue records in the Americas 
and rest of Asia
-
Pacific and saw further improvement in our revenue trends 
in Greater
 
China.
 
In iPhone, where customers have only begun to get their hands on the 
strongly popular and unmatched iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models, our 
year
-
over
-
year performance continue to improve, more on that in a 
moment.
 
Outside of iPhone, our September q
uarter revenue was up 17%. We reached 
a new all
-
time high for services with growth accelerating to 18%. We 
generated well over 50% revenue growth from Wearables, and I am thrilled 
to say that we set Q4 records for Wearables in each and every market we 
trac

 
iPhone revenue in the September quarter was $33 billion. This 9% decline 
over last year is a significant improvement over the 15% decline we saw 
across the first three quarters. The signifi
cant upswing in demand in the final 
part of the quarter is mirrored in the overwhelmingly positive reviews, 
customer feedback and in
-
store response we've seen for this new generation 
of devices, not to mention a wave of the best photos you've seen from a 
s
martphone.
 
iPhone 11 features the Apple
-
designed A13 Bionic the fastest most powerful 
chip ever in a smartphone plus an all new dual camera system and even 
longer all day battery life all wrapped in six great new colors. Since its 
launch, the iPhone 11 has
 
quickly become our best
-
selling iPhone.
 
iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max deliver even more advanced 
performance for users who want the very best out of their smartphone. The 
new Super Retina XDR display is the brightest ever in an iPhone, and the 
new t
riple camera system provides a pro level photography experience with 
an ultra
-
wide, wide and telephoto camera.
 
All three of our new iPhones feature night mode delivering huge 
improvements to photo capture in low light environments either indoors or 
outdoor
s. They also produce the highest quality video in a smartphone 
supporting 4K video with extended dynamic range for more highlight detail 
and cinematic video stabilization.
 
iOS 13 is driving user experience forward across the iPhone family with a 
bold new l
ook in dark mode, major updates to the apps our customers use 
every day, such as photos and maps, new ways to help protect their privacy 
with sign
-
in with Apple and performance improvements across the entire 
system.
 
For Services, revenue was $12.5 billion,
 
that's up 18% over last year and it 
beats the previous record set in the June quarter by more than $1 billion. 
This isn't a local phenomenon. We saw double
-
digit services revenue growth 
and all
-
time records in all five of our geographic segments, and it w
asn't a 
narrow success either.
 
We established new all
-
time highs for multiple services categories including 
the App Store, AppleCare, Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad 
business. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling o
ur 
fiscal year '16 Services revenue during 2020.
 
I want to touch on a number of services in brief. We had all
-
time record 
revenues from payment services. For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions 
more than doubled year
-
over
-
year with over 3 billion transacti
ons in the 
September quarter exceeding PayPal's number of transactions and growing 
four times as fast.
 
Apple Pay is now live in 49 markets around the world with over 6,000 
issuers on the platform. We believe that Apple Pay offers the best possible 
mobile p
ayment experience and the safest, most secure solution on the 
market. We're glad that 1000s of banks around the world participate.
 
Apple Card launched in the US in August, and we've been thrilled by the 
positive reception we've seen. Users can apply for Ap
ple Card through the 
wallet app on iPhone in minutes and start using it right away in stores, in 
apps and on websites.
 
They've told us they love Apple Card's simplicity, privacy, security and 
transparency, which has helped them make healthier financial cho
ices. Apple 
Card has absolutely no fees and major apps and retailers like Uber, Uber 
Eats, Walgreens, Duane Reade, and T
-
Mobile have already joined to offer 
3% daily cash back on Apple Card transactions.
 
And I am very pleased to announce today that later t
his year, we are adding 
another great feature to Apple Card. Customers will be able to purchase 
their new iPhone and pay for it over it over 24 months with zero interest. 
And they will continue to enjoy all the benefits of Apple Card, including 3% 
cash bac
k on the total cost of their iPhone with absolutely no fees and the 
ability to simply manage their payments right in the Apple Wallet app on 
iPhone. We think these features appeal broadly to all iPhone customers, and 
we believe this has been the most succe
ssful launch of a credit card in 
United States ever.
 
Last month, we launched Apple Arcade, our groundbreaking game 
subscription service offering an all new way for the whole family to enjoy 
games online or offline. Apple Arcade's subscribers get unlimited 
access to a 
curated selection of games from many of the most innovative developers in 
the world with almost 100 new titles playable across iPhone, iPad, iPod 
touch, Mac and Apple TV today and more are being added all the time. 
Customer feedback to date has
 
been overwhelmingly positive, and we're 
very excited for the future of the service.
 
We're also thrilled to be working with Oprah Winfrey to bring Oprah's Book 
Club to Apple Books connecting a community of readers worldwide to 
important stories by today's 
most thought
-
provoking authors. Together, we 
envision a vibrant global book club that has the power to bring the world 
together through reading.
 
We've also expanded the reach of Apple News+ beyond the United States 
and Canada to readers in 
Australia and the United Kingdom, bringing 
together popular publications, such as the Times of London, the Australian 
and Hello Magazine, in addition to major publications like The Wall Street 
Journal, The LA Times, The New Yorker, People, GQ and much more
.
 
And rounding at our newest services just two days from now, we're 
launching the hotly anticipated Apple TV+ in over 100 countries and regions. 
It's the first all original video subscription service, which shows from the 
best, most ambitious and most crea
tive minds in the industry.
 
One of the great parts of this jobs is that I've gotten to binge
-
watch almost 
all of them, and while I won't spoil anything, there is so much to look 
forward to here for lovers of great storytelling.
 
We premiered shows like See 
and The Morning Show in LA and New York 
over the past couple of weeks, and the stage is set for a truly exciting debut. 
And we're pleased that customers who have purchased qualifying Apple 
devices starting September 10 can opt into 12 free months of Apple 
TV+.
 
Turning to Wearables, we had amazing results, thanks to the phenomenal 
popularity of Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. As I said at the 
outset, we set Q4 revenue records for Wearables in every single market that 
we track around the world. In Se
ptember, we launched Apple Watch Series 5 
with the Always
-
On Retina display, that means you never have to pause a 
workout or task to raise or tap the display.
 
New location features help users better navigate their day while international 
emergency calling 
allows them to call emergency services directly from 
Apple Watch in over 150 countries even without an iPhone nearby.
 
And combined with the power of watchOS 6, users are empowered to take 
charge of their health and fitness with new features like Cycle Trac
king, the 
Noise app, Activity Trends. The ECG app now available in 32 markets 
including India has become a widely celebrated illustration of Apple's 
commitment to your health giving users the ability to document and monitor 
the functioning of their heart a
nd provide critical data to their doctors.
 
We're deepening Apple's commitment to medical research. We announced a 
new Research app paired with three unprecedented medical studies 
spanning Hearing, Heart and Movement and Women's Health.
 
We are collaborating
 
with leading health institutions to reach more 
participants than has ever been possible enabling them to contribute to 
potential medical discoveries and help create the next generation of 
innovative health products.
 
Leveraging the devices customers use ev
ery day and world
-
class security 
and privacy, we hope to democratize medical research and bring everyone to 
the table to make the next big breakthroughs possible.
 
Turning to iPad, we generated 17% growth driven by iPad Pro in the ongoing 
momentum of our wi
der line
-
up. In September, we introduced the seventh
-
generation iPad bringing more screen area and support for the full
-
sized 
Smart Keyboard to our most popular, most affordable iPad.
 
For the first time, we also released iPadOS built on the same foundation
 
as 
iOS but with powerful apps designed for iPads large multi
-
touch display, 
letting users multitask with intuitive gestures and drag and drop of file with 
the fingertip.
 
For Mac, we generated $7 billion in revenue. We had a tough comparison to 
last year's
 
fourth quarter when we updated both models of MacBook Pro, but 
for fiscal 2019 overall, we generated the highest annual revenue ever from 
our Mac business. In July, we updated our Mac portables with great pricing 
for students and MacBook Air in particular
 
has been a hit in the back
-
to
-
school season.
 
Earlier this month, we released macOS Catalina with all new entertainment 
apps, the innovative sidecar feature that uses iPad to expand the Mac 
workspace and new accessibility tools that enable users to control
 
their Mac 
entirely with their voice. Catalina also brings the Apple Arcade experience to 
the Mac and we have already seen some amazing third
-
party developers 
bring their iPad apps to the Mac App Store with Mac Catalyst including 
Twitter, Post
-
it and more.
 
And for our pro customers who push the limits of what Mac can do, we're 
very excited about the upcoming launch of our newly redesigned Mac Pro 
this fall, which we are proud to be manufacturing in Austin, Texas.
 
Pulling back the lens from a single quarter,
 
we are incredibly proud of our 
accomplishments over the course of a remarkable fiscal 2019, a year where 
we crossed $100 billion in revenue in the United States for the first time.
 
We introduce new services from Apple Card to Apple TV+ and generated 
over 
$46 billion in total services revenue, setting new yearly services records 
in all five of our geographic segments and driving our Services business to 
the size of a Fortune 70 company.
 
We delivered incredible new hardware in all our device categories. Our 
Wearables business showed explosive growth and generated more annual 
revenue than two
-
thirds of the companies in the Fortune 500. And we set a 
yearly revenue record for Mac. All told, outside of iPhone, our revenue grew 
by $17 billion to almost a $118 bill
ion.
 
Our overall success was achieved widely across our markets with annual 
revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, 
Poland, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. And as we head into 
the holiday season, we have a
n enormous amount to look forward to. We 
believe that we lead in innovation because we lead with our values.
 
At the time of urgency and action on climate change, we continue to drive 
breakthroughs in clean power sustainable materials and device recycling. 
By 
running a 100% of our global operations on renewable energy and 
challenging our entire network of suppliers do the same, we are driving a 
virtuous cycle of demand for clean sources of power. And we see the award 
Apple recently received from the United N
ation's Global Climate Action 
program as a mandate to deepen this vital work.
 
We continue to invent and improve on cutting edge renewable materials, 
including the 100% recycled aluminum alloy found in many of our products, 
and we've added rare earth elemen
ts to our list of recycled materials with 
the introduction of iPhone 11. We're disassembling, recycling or refurbishing 
millions of devices every year with the help of Daisy, our recycling robot, 
and we're pushing the entire global supply chain toward recy
cled or 
renewable materials.
 
We're driving access to critical coding skills development to educators and 
students through programs such as our teaching coding academies and our 
free everyone can code curriculum. We continue to put user privacy at the 
cente
r of everything that we do and we know that Apple is strongest when 
our commitment to diversity and inclusion brings all voices to the table.
 
I'd like to thank our customers, our developers, our business partners and 
our employees for making fiscal 2019 su
ch a success, and I look forward to 
another great year in 2020.
 
Now for more details on our September quarter results, I'll turn the call over 
to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was 
$64 billion, up 2% fr
om a year ago to a new September quarter record as 
we had predicted foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by 
close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%.
 
Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due
 
to 
iPhone, but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and 
iPad. Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year
-
over
-
year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all
-
time record with 
broad
-
based growth around 
the world and across our portfolio.
 
On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our 
Americas and rest of Asia
-
Pacific segments. We also saw continuous 
improvement in Greater China where year
-
over
-
year revenue comparisons 
became more
 
favorable each quarter of fiscal 2019 from a 27% decline in 
the first quarter to a 2% decline in the fourth quarter.
 
At a country level, we established new Q4 records in many major developed 
and emerging markets including the U.S., Canada, 
Germany, France, Korea, 
Singapore, Brazil, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.
 
Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by 
leverage from higher revenue. Products gross margin was 31.6%, up 120 
basis points sequentially due t
o leverage and favorable mix. Services gross 
margin was 64.1% even with the June quarter.
 
Net income was $13.7 billion. Diluted EPS was a Q4 record at $3.03 and up 
4% year
-
over
-
year, and operating cash flow of $19.9 billion was also a Q4 
record, up almost 
$400 million from the previous record we set last year.
 
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone 
revenue was $33.4 billion a year
-
over
-
year decline of 9%. This was a 
meaningful improvement to the 12% decline in the third quart
er and a 16% 
decline in the first half of the fiscal year. And we saw great customer 
response to the launch of iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro max at the end of 
the quarter.
 
Our active installed base of iPhone continues to grow to a new all
-
time high 
in each 
of our geographic segments. And in the U.S., the latest survey of 
consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% 
for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. Among business buyers who plan 
to purchase smartphones in the December quarte
r 83% plan to purchase 
iPhones.
 
Turning to Services, we had a very strong quarter with all
-
time record 
performance and growth accelerating from the June quarter. All five 
geographic segments set new all
-
time Services revenue records and all grew 
double
-
dig
its.
 
We also established new all
-
time records for the App Store, Apple Care, 
Music, Cloud Services, Payment Services and our App Store search ad 
business. In total, services accounted for 20% of our revenue mix and 33% 
of our gross margin mix.
 
Customer eng
agement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number 
of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a 
new all
-
time high with double
-
digit growth in paid accounts in all our 
geographic segments.
 
We now have 450 million paid
 
subscriptions across the services on our 
platform compared to over 330 million just a year ago, and we are well on 
our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.
 
Absolute revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer 
de
mand for both in
-
app purchases and subscriptions. Our third
-
party 
subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 
40% year
-
over
-
year.
 
There are now more than 35,000 subscription apps on our platform, with the 
largest accounting f
or less than 0.25% of total services revenue. Among our 
many all
-
time services records, it was the best quarter ever for AppleCare. 
Thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution.
 
And to better meet our customers' needs, we annou
nced a new iPhone 
repair program making it easier for independent providers across the U.S. to 
tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider 
network and offering customers additional options for the most common out
-
of
-
warranty iPhone
 
repairs.
 
The new program complements our continued investment in our growing 
global network of over 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers the lead the 
industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in 
and out
-
of
-
warranty servi
ce for all Apple products.
 
Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% 
from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our 
MacBook Air line
-
up and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of 
MacBoo
k Pro models.
 
Despite the tough compare, we generated an all
-
time revenue record for 
Mac in the US and in India and a fourth quarter revenue record in Japan. 
More than half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were 
new to Mac, and the active
 
installed base of Macs again reached a new all
-
time high.
 
We had great results for iPad with revenue of $4.7 billion, up 17% from a 
year ago. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments with a Q4 
revenue record in Japan. In total, over half o
f the customers purchasing 
iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active 
installed base also reached a new all
-
time high.
 
The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 95% customer 
satisfaction rating for iPad from consume
rs and 97% from businesses. And 
among both consumers and businesses who plan to purchase tablets in the 
December quarter more than 80% plan to purchase iPads.
 
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new fourth quarter record 
with revenue of $6.5 bill
ion, up 54% year
-
over
-
year with growth 
accelerating from the third quarter across all five geographic segments.
 
The performance was driven by tremendous growth across Apple Watch, 
AirPods, BIS products and accessories. And as Tim mentioned, we set Q4 
recor
ds for our Wearables category in every single market we track around 
the world.
 
Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record 
September quarter revenue in all five geographic segments, and strong 
double
-
digit growth across iPho
ne, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories. We 
also continue to see great results from our trade
-
in program with more than 
five times the iPhone trade
-
in volume we had a year ago.
 
Last month, we reopened the standing Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York 
with an
 
even more welcoming layout beneath the landmark glass cube 
providing nearly twice the space of the original store.
 
This iconic store is opened seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and provides 
an even better environment for customers to experience our lates
t products, 
meet with our geniuses, created pros and specialists, and attend our free 
daily Today at Apple sessions.
 
We also opened our newest and largest store in Japan, and fifth store in 
Tokyo, in the Marunouchi business district across from the histori
c Tokyo 
Station, and we opened a beautiful new store in the heart of Mexico City's 
vibrant Polanco district to welcome visitors to experience the best of Apple in 
Mexico.
 
We are seeing strong demand for our products in the enterprise market, 
with growth si
gnificantly ahead of our business overall, and we have great 
momentum transforming major industries.
 
One example is retail. 80 of the 100 largest retailers in the world are 
choosing Apple to modernize their customers and employee experiences 
across all fun
ctions of their business.
 
Retailers are using iPhone, iPad and Mac to optimize their back of house 
operations, modernize point of sale, and deliver differentiated customer and 
employee experiences.
 
Customer engagement and assisted selling have been areas o
f particular 
focus and we're seeing great results for iconic brands such as Burberry, 
Ralph Lauren, Sephora USA, Gap Inc., and many others.
 

technologies to improve the effectiveness and effic
iency of the way they 
deliver critical services to the public. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau is 
making fundamental changes to the design and implementation of next 
year's census with a goal of producing quality results, while reducing costs 
by levera
ging the mobility user experience and privacy of iOS.
 
Hundreds of thousands of Apple devices will be deployed this fiscal year to 
support an innovative new model for the collection and management of 
Census data and we are proud that our products will 
play an important role 
in driving quality to this critical initiative while safeguarding the privacy and 
security of this data.
 
CDW Apple's partner in this initiative will also utilize Apple Financial 
Services, our enterprise financing platform to help min
imize the cost to the 
public by taking advantage of the uniquely strong residual value of Apple 
devices.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost 
$260 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $7 billion of new 
ter
m debt, retired $3 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper 
by $4 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As 
a result, net cash was $98 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue 
on our path to reaching a
 
net cash neutral position over time.
 
We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, 
including almost $18 billion through open market repurchases of 86 million 
Apple shares and $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. We also 
retired 
an additional 7 million shares in the final settlement of our 14th ASR.
 
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the type of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of th
e call. We expect revenue to be between $85.5 
billion and $89.5 billion. This range includes a negative impact from foreign 
exchange of over $1 billion.
 
We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx 
to be between $9.6 billion and $9.
8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about 
$200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.
 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per 
share of common stock, payable on November 14, 2019 to shareholders of 
record as o
f November 11, 2019.
 
Before we open the call to questions, I also have a special announcement to 
make today. Nancy Paxton, our Head of Investor Relations for the last 23 
years has decided to retire at the end of December after a wonderful 33 year 
career at
 
Apple and 93 earnings calls. Nancy has been the face of Apple with 
analysts and investors over a period of incredible growth and success.
 
Her passion for our company, her commitment and dedication to serve our 
entire investor base and her sense of humor w
ill be missed greatly. 
Personally, I'm very grateful for the advice and support you have given me 
during this last six years. We all wish you the very best for the next and 
exciting phase of your life.
 
With that, let us open the call to questions.
 
Nancy Pa
xton
 
Thank you very much for the kind remarks, Luca. It's obviously been a great 
privilege for me to engage with so many investors and analysts on behalf of 
Apple over the last couple of decades, and of course it's been an extreme 
pleasure to work alongsid
e with some of the brilliant people here at Apple on 
a day to day basis. But let's get to the business at hand for the 93rd time, 
and open the call to questions. We ask that you limit yourself to two 
questions. Operator, may we have the first question plea
se.

Certainly, today that will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter. iPhone 
revenue trajectory did improve, but it's still declin
ed 9%. So can you talk 
about the drivers that will allow you to get that category back to growth? 
And if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?
 
Tim Cook
 
Katy, it's Tim. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early goin
g on 
iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It's early but the trends look very 
good. So I don't want to make a long
-
range forecast here. We've put our 
current thinking in the guidance and you can tell from the guidance we are 
bullish.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Great
. And Luca on margins guidance is consistent with September, but 
there is a lot going on under the covers; tariffs could expand in mid
-
December; there is some impact from the TV+ bundle; you have some big 
currency in commodity price move. So can you just t
alk about the gives and 
takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. Katy, of course. As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we 
are essentially flat sequentially. On one side, we expect 
--
 
on the positive 
side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. On the other side, foreign 
exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we've 
got right now is going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis.
 
Also keep in mind that during the
 
holiday season, we have a higher mix of 
products revenue than we have in other quarters, and that obviously is 
dilutive to the company 
--
 
to the company margin.
 
On a year
-
over
-
year basis, we are also about flat. And on one side, we've 
got better commodity
 
pricing, the environment is better than it was a year 
ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
Our next question will be 
from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
 
Mike Olson
 
Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So Wearables category 
has been strong, and it's hard to believe it's now essentially the same size as 
Mac. But related to Apple's initiatives in healthcare, 
do you think health
-
related features are a primary driver of Wearables growth and maybe 
conversely how important is a rising installed base of Wearables and the 
data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple 
health? And then I have
 
a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 
Michael, it's Tim. The Wearables have done extremely well. It was 
acceleration further from the previous quarter. So we're thrilled with the 
results as to what's driving it it's the totality that's driving it. For some 
people it's ab
out fitness; for some people, it's about health; for some other 
people, it's about communication; and for some people, it's all of the above. 
And I think the new feature of Always
-
On on Series 5 is a game changer for 
many of our users.
 
And in terms of othe
r health
-
related things that we have going, we will be 
continuing to build out our health records connection into the health app, 
really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can 
easily go from doctor to doctor.
 
We've got the rese
arch going that I had mentioned earlier, there will be 
more of those through time, and obviously we've got things that we're not 
going to talk about just yet that we're working on. But as I've said before, 
my view is there will be a day in the future that 
we look back, and Apple's 
greatest contribution will be to people's health.
 
Mike Olson
 
Okay. Thanks. And then with the strong slate of content in Apple TV+, can 
you just talk about the strategy behind giving it away to those that are 
buying in applicable d
evice versus charging for it? And my congrats to 
Nancy. And thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes, it's a gift to our users, and from a business point of view, we'd like to 
--
 
we're really proud of the content. We'd like as many people as possible to 
view it. And so thi
s allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly 
in the early going. And so we are 
-
 
we feel great about doing that.
 
I think it's a bold move. And the price also for those people that are not 
buying a device in the period of time that we offer 
this, the price is very 
aggressive as well. You think 
-
 
think about the quality of content that you 
get for 499, and it's amazing. It is amazing.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 

Daryanani.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Yes. Thanks a lot guys. I guess two questions from me as well. First one, 
Tim, if you think about the Services business, less than $2 billion away from 
the targets you had laid out a few years back. But I am wondering if you 
think
 
about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several 
years, the high
-
teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was 
driven by the installed base growing versus incremental monetization of the 
installed base. And do you see th
at ratio essentially flipping or changing as 
you go forward?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think, we have opportunities, Amit, in both the growth of the installed base 
as Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every 
category, hit new highs in the last qua
rter and we hit new highs in all of our 
top 20 markets.
 
And so the installed base is clearly a piece of it getting the trade
-
in program 
going, and the secondary market moving has been helpful in that as well. 
And, of course, ultimately the thing that build
s the installed base is to make 
customers happy, and that's our 
--
 
always our top objective is to have 
satisfied customers.
 
The other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas, the ARPU is 
increasing. And so, as there is more offers out there, I m
ean the one that is 
today getting the attention is on the streaming side.
 
But if you look at the number of services that have been added over the 
years, it's significant and people love them. And so it's really both of those. 
And obviously in 
-
 
finally in 
getting more people that are enjoying things for 
free to 
-
 
let to pay for some of the premium services. So it's sort of all three 
of those.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Got it. And if I was just kind of go back to the variables discussion, 
especially as I think about Ap
ple Watch and AirPods, is there a central way 
to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices for Apple Watch 
and AirPod update.
 
I just want to understand if I think about 900 million plus iPhone installed 
base, what kind of penetration do you h
ave at Wearables and how long could 
this one maybe as you go forward?
 
Tim Cook
 

nice try and get me to say that. The 
--
 
what we're seeing in terms of new 
adds on the Watch, I 
think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments is 
about three
-
quarters of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch.
 
And so we are still insignificantly in the build mode there, and so don't think 
of the penetration as anywhere near sort of a matur
e penetration. We got lot 
left there, and the AirPods just keep hitting new highs.
 
And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter too and we are really 
proud to add another product out there for people wanting noise
-
cancelling 
with the AirPod Pro be
ginning to sell today.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much. First, Nancy, just want to send you our best wishes. 
We will def
initely miss you. I'm sure, I agree with Luca, you've been very 
instrumental over the years.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you.
 
Shannon Cross
 
My questions though with regard to China, and I don't know, Tim, if you can 
talk more about what you're seeing in China, the 
trends during the quarter, 
the reception specifically there to the iPhone, any thoughts on 
-
 
you know, 
Hong Kong used to be a big market, there is obviously some turmoil there. 
So if you could provide some more in China that would be helpful? Thank 
you.
 
Ti
m Cook
 
Yes, we had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of 
the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and so we feel really 
good about how we've gotten started there. As you can tell from the 
numbers, we've significantly 
improved since the beginning of the year. 
We've gone from minus well into the 20s to minus two last quarter.
 
And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew one. And so 
there is a very slight growth there. We obviously want that to be bett
er. But 
we feel good about how we're doing.
 
I think it's a combination of things that are 
-
 
that have turned things around. 
On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less and that clearly looks 
positive right now with the comments that we've been read
ing in the press.
 
Secondly, the products have been extremely well received there. Third, the 
things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view 
and trade
-
in, getting the trade
-
in program up and running, all of these 
things have had mo
ved the dial. And so it's sort of the sum of all of that.
 
I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew 
double digit. We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter, or I 
should say some key gaming approvals.
 
It's not a
ll about quantity, but about which ones, we saw that. Also 
Wearables, Wearables are doing so great at a company level. They're doing 
even better in China. And so lots of positives there.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you. And then, I'm curious, Luca, maybe you can t
alk a bit about how 
you think about operating expense growth. It continues to grow significantly 
faster than revenue. So I am just curious as to where you're targeting the 
incremental spend? And then, is there a point at which we might just see 
some levera
ge? Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Well, you know, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles. In some 
cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth. In other cases, like 
fiscal '19, it was the other way around. But our approach frankly is not 
changing over
 
time. We want to invest in the business.
 
Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D 
space, because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user 
experience differentiate our products.
 
We continue to run SG&A tight
ly. Obviously, if you look at what we had 
launched in the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new 
products, and now we are launching a lot of new services.
 
And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in 
marketing and adve
rtising to raise the awareness of the new products and 
new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that 

and so we're making investments both in enginee
ring and in advertising to 
support the new launches.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 

 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes. Thank you. I think this is for Luca, and then I 
have a follow
-
up as well. 
If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a 
sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 
50% or more, and even last year given that iPhone is a slower growing 
product,
 
you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially.
 
So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables 
products and the new services, I guess the question is, why is your guidance 
not stronger for Q1 on the top line?
 
And is that sort 
of a reflection of conservatism given that there's a lot of 
uncertainty in the world and we certainly saw that last year? Or are there 
other forces at work that we should be considered?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Toni, thanks for the question. The guidance that we are p
roviding if you look 
at it at the midpoint implies an acceleration of growth from the performance 
that we've seen during the course of fiscal 2019.
 
As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. 
This is about $1.1 billion of ne
gative foreign exchange on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis. So that is something to keep in mind.
 
We feel very good as Tim said about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has 
started, and we do expect an improvement in our year
-
over
-
year growth 
rate on iPhone. Wearabl
es has very, very strong momentum. The portfolio of 
services also has incredible momentum.
 
One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that 
we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro, a year 
ago for iPad a
s well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the 
December quarter last year.
 
So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our 
launch timing is different on a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Okay. Thank you for that. And
 
then if I could follow
-
up, just on the bundling 
of Apple TV+, I guess for you, Tim, this is really the first time we've seen a 
significant bundling of services offering and hardware offering.
 
And I'm wondering if you view this as kind of a strategic advan
tage of Apple 
and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings 
-
 
bundled 
offerings, and ultimately do you 
-
 
do you ever believe that your hardware 
itself might be offered as a bundled service.
 
And maybe while we're on that either you or Luca 
could give us the 30 
second tutorial on how we should think about the deferred revenue 
accounting? Approximately how much of the $60 are you going to be 
deferring, and what's your expectation for attach rate on that? Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Let me cover th
e accounting issue first. Obviously, we need to make some 
assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the 
--
 
on Apple TV+, 
right. And we don't want to get into the details of that because we do those 
assumptions as confidential and competitively s
ensitive.
 
But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors 
including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact 
that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around 
the world, the avail
ability of local content at the beginning of the service, 
how many people do we have with payment methods on file.
 
So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is 
going to be. Obviously, those assumptions will possibly change ov
er time as 
we get more information on how the customers behave. We haven't 
launched the service yet 
-
 
we're going to serve 
-
 
serving our customers 
tomorrow. So we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these 
different factors.
 
Tim Cook
 
On the 
bundle question, Toni, we look at each service, and decide what's 
best to do for it and with TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more 
people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for 
our users, and so that's what we're d
oing.
 
You can also see that on the other services we're not doing that. And so it's 
not part of a broader pattern, or although I wouldn't want to rule out for the 
future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time.
 
In terms of hardware 
as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are 
customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they 
are on upgrade plans and so forth. And so to some degree that exists today, 
my perspective is that we will grow in the future to l
arger numbers that will 
grow disproportionately.
 
And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler 
for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things. That's a 
part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier
 
in the call and so we 
are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a 
recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of 
standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than 
perhaps i
t is today.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
That will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
 
Chris Caso
 
Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. And Nancy, congratulations to you too, and 
we're going to miss you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you.
 
Chris Caso
 
My first question is about pricing and the effect of some of the lower price 
points for iPhone 11 as compared to last year. And it looked like margins and 
revenues did well on that, and also followed some price adjustment
s you 
made in emerging markets last year, and obviously we've seen some 
improvement in China as well.
 
So if you could talk about maybe what that tells us about pricing strategy in 
general and perhaps that you're willing to take a little more flexible appro
ach 
to drive some elasticity if you think that's going to have a positive effect?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and 
well received and do show a level of elasticity, but the most important thing 
by far is t
he product. And I think we've got the best line
-
up we've ever had 
in the customer response to the product and what the product does for them 
is really incredible.
 
And photos I am getting from many users around the world are just 
incredible that people are 
taking. And so I think it's product first, and then 
prices sort of falls out of that, and we did decide to be more aggressive. And 
looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call.
 
In terms of emerging markets we picked sort of loca
lly relevant prices, and 
in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange 
rate that would have reflected a while back, instead of the current exchange 
rate.
 
And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price 
p
oint that we knew was effective for that particular market. And those in 
addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been 
extremely well received.
 
Chris Caso
 
Thank you. As a follow
-
on, perhaps you could talk about the potential for 
some of the tariffs that are upcoming what 
--
 
do you have a view of what 
potential impact that could have going forward and how Apple is looking to 
address it? Will you need to adjust your own pricing if in fact the tariffs are 
imposed?
 
Tim Cook
 
We are pay
ing some tariffs today as you know, some that went into effect 
pre
-
September, and some others that went into effect in September. So we 
are paying some that's been comprehended. But in general, my view is very 
positive in terms of how things are going, and
 
that positive view is obviously 
factored in our guidance as well.
 
And just the tone I think has changed significantly and I have long thought 
that it was in both countries, best interests to get to an agreement that may 
be initially doesn't solve everythi
ng but solves some things that each party 
may want and get to a better place than where we're at and I'm hopeful that 
that's where we're headed.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Chris. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
That will be from Samik Chatter
jee with JPMorgan.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off 
with one of the new services Apple Arcade, and if you have any insights in 
terms of what you're seeing for engagement or retention of customer
s 
beyond the initial trial period also how your partnerships with developers 
progressing there. How does the pipeline look like than any early projections 
of what that business longer term might look like?
 
Tim Cook
 
We're not going to give out projections o
n it, but I would tell you that we 
were really pleased with the number of people that enter the trial period. 
People are just coming out of the 30
-
day trial period in the last few days or 
week or so. And so it's really too early to tell what the conversion
 
rate will 
be.
 
But I feel like we're off to a good start and the 
-
 
most important of 
everything. The customer feedback to date has really been incredible and 
we're very excited for the future of the service.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Great. As a follow
-
up if I can, trying to attack the Wearables question within 
the angle, what are you seeing in terms of 
--
 
I believe consumer behavior in 
upgrading Wearables like Apple Watch AirPods and how are you thinking 
about your ability to accelera
te some of that replacement cycle by driving 
innovation?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think we, because the Watch is relatively young. We haven't seen enough 
upgrade cycles to really establish a pattern as yet. And as I've mentioned 
before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Ap
ple Watch currently or last quarter 
I should say were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. And so there is 
still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard.
 
I do think the upgrade market will look at larger over time, but just don't 
have a c
urrent view as to 
--
 
how often and so forth. On the AirPods we're 
anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro.
 
But I would guess that one particularly in the early going will be people that 
have AirPods today and want to have 
--
 
also have a pair f
or the times that 
they need noise cancellation.

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon everyone, and thanks very much for 
joining us. I'm very happy to share with you the outstanding results of 
Apple's December quarter. We generated the highest quarterly 
revenue in 
Apple's history along with all
-
time unit and revenue records for iPhone and 
Apple Watch, all
-
time revenue records for Services and Mac, and all
-
time 
revenue records for four out of our five geographic segments. The strong 
performance of our busi
ness also produced all
-
time record earnings per 
share.
 
Revenue in the quarter was $78.4 billion, which was above the top of our 
guidance range. iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional 
demand that beat our own internal expectations. While iPho
ne 7 is our most 
popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which 
was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus 
models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout 
the quarter, and we 
came into supply/demand balance in January.
 
iPhone 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, 
especially the dual camera system, which produces stunning portraits and 
high
-
quality zoom. This is a uniquely Apple feature that is surprising
 
and 
delighting our users. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our 
customers to be more productive, more engaged, and more expressive than 
ever by integrating hardware, software, and services to create experiences 
that only Apple can deliver.
 
It
 
was our best quarter ever for Services, with almost $7.2 billion in 
revenue. App Store customers broke all
-
time records during the holiday 
quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the 
App Store's single best month ever.
 
Our 
innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 
million apps for doing almost anything that you can imagine. Apple's 
developer community has now earned over $60 billion, including over $20 
billion in 2016 alone.
 
Revenue from our music busin
ess grew for the third quarter in a row, and 
our AppleCare and iPlus storage services had all
-
time record results.
 
Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with the number of users more 
than tripling over the past year and hundreds of millions of transacti
ons and 
billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone. Transaction 
volume was up over 500% year over year as we expanded to four new 
countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain, bringing us into 
a total of 13 markets. Apple 
Pay on the Web is delivering our partners great 
results. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting invoice payments 
with Apply Pay through Intuit QuickBooks Online, FreshBooks, and other 
billing partners. And beginning this quarter, Comcast customers
 
can pay 
their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay.
 
Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the 
revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our Services 
offerings are now driving over 150 million paid cu
stomer subscriptions. This 
includes our own services and third
-
party content that we offer on our 
stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the 
size of our Services business in the next four years.
 
The Mac not only returned to gr
owth but generated its highest quarterly 
revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying 
their first Mac, with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC.
 
The new MacBook Touch with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the 
innovation made possible by integrating world
-
class hardware and software. 
We were supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the 
December quarter and are just now coming into supply/demand balance.
 
It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Wa
tch, both units and revenues, 
with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch 
is the best
-
selling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved, with the 
highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch 
is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it is the gold standard for 
smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch.
 
We're also thrilled with the response to AirPods. Customers love the magical 
experience AirPods are delivering. And if y
ou haven't tried them yet, you'll 
be delighted when you do. They're far ahead of anything else on the market 
today, and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible demand.
 
With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Wat
ch, 
and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple
-
designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products. Their 
design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge 
growth potential for wearables going
 
forward.
 
Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people 
spend their time, at the gym, on the go, in the home, and on the job. For 
example, every major automaker is committed to supporting CarPlay with 
over 200 different models anno
unced, including five of the top 10 selling 
models in the United States. There are well over 1 million people using 
CarPlay now, and this continues to grow rapidly.
 
And we are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home 
automation into a majo
r platform with iOS 10. With Siri and a new Home 
app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of 
your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch.
 
The number of HomeKit
-
compatible accessories continues to grow 
rapidly, 
with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video 
cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water 
leaks. Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to 
securing your home with HomeK
it
-
enabled door locks, garage doors, and 
alarm systems.
 
I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS 
into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house 
lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to
 
the living room to 
relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the 
fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the 
lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. When I return 
to my house i
n the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself 
for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home 
automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with 
iOS and HomeKit.
 
We're making great progress 
in the enterprise market alongside our major 
partners. The combination of iOS and Cisco technology is giving companies 
everywhere the opportunity to vastly improve the user experience for their 
mobile employees. With enhanced networking performance, up to 
eight 
times faster roaming, better reliability for apps, and native voice experience, 
we're excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with 
these great capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer 
opportunities has grown over
 
70% since last quarter.
 
Enterprises are using IBM's new Mobile at Scale design and development 
model to deploy multiple iOS apps with speed and efficiency. For example, 
Finnair is transforming aircraft maintenance, and CEMEX is revamping 
activities from a
ttracting new clients to invoicing to after
-
sales support. And 
later this spring, SAP will be rolling out its SDK for iOS, providing its 
community of more than 2.5 million developers the tools to build powerful 
native iOS apps that leverage the SAP HANA cl
oud platform. We're delighted 
with how these partnerships are making it even easier for enterprise 
customers to transform how work gets done with iOS.
 
As we reflect on a record
-
breaking December quarter, I'd like to thank our 
developers, our business partn
ers, and our employees for their incredible 
contributions and commitment. And I'd like to thank all of our customers 
around the world for their excitement and loyalty, which ultimately drive 
these results.
 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Luca to talk about
 
the quarter in more detail.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December 
quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in the history of 
Apple and above our guidance range. As Tim 
mentioned, the strength of our 
results was very broad
-
based, as we set new revenue records for iPhone, for 
Services, for Mac, and for Apple Watch. We also established new all
-
time 
revenue records in most developed and emerging markets, with strong 
growth r
ates in many countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, 
Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia.
 
We accomplished all this despite a very challenging foreign exchange 
environment due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As we had 
ex
pected, our year
-
over
-
year performance in Greater China improved 
significantly relative to the September quarter. Total Greater China segment 
revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China was even with 
the all
-
time record results from a year ago an
d grew in constant currency 
terms. In all other geographic segments, we generated all
-
time quarterly 
record results.
 
We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was 
offset by four factors. First, this year we grew China invento
ry significantly 
less than a year ago. Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September 
quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a 
more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year. Third, the 
stronger U.S. dollar a
ffected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis 
points. And fourth, our year
-
ago revenue included the benefit of a one
-
off 
$548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest 
left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our pr
oducts throughout 
the quarter this year.
 
Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating 
margin was 29.8% of revenue, and net income was $17.9 billion. Diluted 
earnings per share were $3.36, a new all
-
time record, and cash flow fro
m 
operations was $27.1 billion.
 
We had a terrific quarter for iPhone as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all
-
time record and an increase of 5% over last year. Customer demand was 
even higher than our reported results, as iPhone unit sell
-
through was up 
8%
.
 
We saw double
-
digit iPhone growth in the U.S., in Canada, Western Europe, 
Japan, and Australia, and even stronger growth in many emerging markets, 
including Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Vietnam. 
iPhone ASP increased to $695 in 
the December quarter from $619 in the 
September quarter, driven by the very strong product mix and the amazing 
success of iPhone 7 Plus.
 
Despite stronger demand than last year, we added only 1.2 million units of 
iPhone channel inventory across the quarter,
 
significantly less than the 
increase of 3.3 million units a year ago. And we exited the quarter near the 
low end of our 5 to 7
-
week target channel inventory range.
 
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are exceptional, not only with 
consumers, bu
t also with business users. In the U.S., for instance, the latest 
data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 97% customer 
satisfaction rating among all iPhone owners and a 99% satisfaction rating for 
owners of iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone
 
buyers, the iPhone 
customer satisfaction rating was 94%. And of those planning to purchase 
smartphones in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone.
 
Turning to Services, we generated an all
-
time record $7.2 billion in revenue, 
an increase of 18% y
ear over year. Our run rate growth was actually higher 
when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week 
added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that 
benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the on
e
-
off $548 million 
patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago.
 
The App Store continued its impressive run, breaking all previous revenue 
records. Year
-
over
-
year App Store revenue growth was 43% through the 
first 13 weeks of the qua
rter. It's great to see that both average revenue per 
paying account and the number of paying accounts grew strongly during the 
quarter. And according to App Annie's latest report, App Store revenue 
continues to outpace the industry overall, with more than
 
double the 
revenue of Google Play in calendar 2016.
 
Next I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.4 million Macs and 
generated our highest
-
ever quarterly Mac revenue. We were very happy to 
report double
-
digit unit growth in several countries, includi
ng Japan, 
Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in the U.S. 
education market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our 4 to 5
-
week 
target range for Mac channel inventory.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold 13.1 million units, which was ahe
ad of our 
expectations. And we posted double
-
digit growth in both Mainland China and 
India, as we've expanded distribution channels in those countries and we 
continue to attract a very high percentage of first
-
time tablet buyers. We 
also reduced channel in
ventory by about 700,000 units as opposed to an 
increase of 900,000 units last year, and we exited the quarter near the low 
end of our five to seven
-
week target range.
 
iPad is incredibly successful in the segments of the tablet market where we 
compete, bot
h in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data 
from NPD indicates that iPad had 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets 
priced above $200. And in November, 451 Research measured a 94% 
consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Mini, a 97% rate for 
iPad Air, and 96% 
for iPad Pro.
 
Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six 
months, purchase intention for iPad is more than four times higher than any 
other brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned 
pur
chases. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a 
purchase intent of 66% for the March quarter. In fact, businesses of all sizes 
are choosing iPad and iPhone to have them reimagine their everyday 
activities. We're seeing strong momentum in se
ctors such as retail, where 
iOS solutions are being deployed for everything from product development 
to logistics to mobile point
-
of
-
sale. Companies like Toys ""R"" Us, Coach, and 
Kate Spade are using iOS and our mobility partner solutions to dramatically 
tr
ansform their customer and employee experiences.
 
Our retail stores experienced strong double
-
digit growth in visitors and 
revenue in the December quarter. And we continued to expand our global 
presence, with plans to open our first store in Singapore and o
ur second 
store in Dubai soon. We are continually updating our stores and adding new 
and exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain 
the community with fresh live music, teach future Swift developers to code, 
and empower entrepren
eurs to start, grow, and evolve their businesses.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $246.1 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $8.5 
billion. $230.2 billion of this cash or 94% of the total was 
outside the United 
States. We also had $77.1 billion in term debt and $10.5 billion in 
commercial paper outstanding at quarter end.
 
We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December 
quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $
3.1 billion in dividends and 
equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares 
through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, 
resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares. We als
o 
completed our eighth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an 
additional 4.4 million shares. This led to a net diluted share count reduction 
of 65.3 million shares during the quarter.
 
We've now completed $201 billion of our current $250 billion 
capital return 
program, including $144 billion in share repurchases. And we plan to provide 
investors with our annual update on the capital return program in the spring.
 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, as expected.
 
And as we move ahead into
 
the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 
billion and $53.5 billion. This guidance range includes a
 
$1.2 billion year
-
over
-
year headwind from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be 
between 38% and 39%. This guidance range includes an 80 basis points 
sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We expect OpEx to be between 
$6.5 billion and $6.6 bil
lion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and 
we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.
 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend up $0.57 per 
share of common stock, payable on February 16, 2017 to shareholders of 
record as of Febr
uary 13, 2017.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen 
the gross margin guidance for the March quarter? And what 
are the one or 
two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put 
you at the high end of that range? And then I have a follow
-
up, thank you.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Sure, Katy. If you look back at our history, 100 basis points r
ange for gross 
margin is not unusual. Clearly during a period when foreign exchange is very 
volatile, we think it's more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I've 
mentioned that we expect 

 
assuming that rates don't move too much, we 
expect foreign exchange
 
to be a major negative as we move from the 
December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated 
significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we've got 80 
basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also
 
have 
the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we 
expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our 
mix of products and services. So obviously if the dollar is a little less strong 
than it is today
, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously, we 
continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we'll see where we 
land.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. And, Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get
 
access to the $200 billion
-
plus of cash that's been locked overseas. So I 
think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around 
potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in 
the past like owning more original
 
content to penetrate more of the TV 
opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. Thank you.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Katy, I am optimistic given what I'm hearing that there would likely be some 
sort of tax reform this year, and 
it does seem like there are people in both 
parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very 
good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait 
and see exactly what it is. But as I said before, we ar
e always looking at 
acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last four 
years. And we look for companies of all sizes, and there's not a size that we 
would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value 
of it.
 
In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water with doing 
some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through 
the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that 
we participate in the changes t
hat are going on in the media industry that I 
fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, 
one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how 
that platform has come along. We have more things planned for
 
it but it's 
come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. 
Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my 
opening comments, there are a number of third
-
party services that are a 
part of that, where
 
we participate economically in some of that by offering 
our platform in selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously, 
with our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content 
business and thinking about ways that we could
 
play at that. Thanks for the 
question.

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess the first question, I really 
appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services 
business, which is up 18% year over year. Can you just talk about? How 
much of that d
o you think is growth in your installed base versus increased 
monetization on a per iOS to iOS basis? And so we are to think about those 
in two separate tranches?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I think you're absolutely right, Amit. We look at it that those ar
e the two key 
elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the 
number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong 
double
-
digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is 
increasing doubl
e digits, right. So it's a combination of the two.
 
Obviously, the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in 
our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to 
the platform and start transacting on the platform
, and we keep track of 
their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and 
more over time. And that's why we are excited about the future of the 
Services business. And that's why, as Tim said, we have a goal that 

 
it's 
already becom
e a very large business. It's going to be a Fortune 100 
company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years.
 
Amit Daryanani

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Perfect. And if I could just switch gears on a follow
-
up, there has been a fair 
am
ount of discussions around your market share in China and what's 
happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in 
Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the 
demand trends you're seeing there on the gro
und, and how do you see that 
transpire through the year?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, I'll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think 
Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about 4 points 
of that was cu
rrency related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency. 
And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat 
year over year, and that was against the all
-
time record quarter. And if you 
look at that on a constant currency ba
sis, it was actually up 6%. So it's a 
significantly better performance on every way you look at it versus what we 
had experienced the prior three quarters.
 
Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best
-
selling 
smartphone in China during th
e quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day, 
which is a huge day in China, as you know, we were the most popular U.S. 
brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China, as the 
company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year over year. iPad 
units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously 
different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also 
saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first
-
time 
buyers, which is a very high number that 
we're pleased with. And obviously, 
our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits.
 
That said, the challenges that are there are, one, the currency has devalued 
6% year over year. And two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficu
lt 
market. And so I look at it in 

 
I'm encouraged with the significant 
improvement, but we're not without challenges there. And I wouldn't want to 
imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how 
broad
-
based the pluses were across o
ur product line.

From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.
 
Shannon S. Cross 
-
 
Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more 
about 
the Services business? And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the 
number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, at least 
that's your expectation. So what gets you there? I don't know, maybe if you 
talk about geographies and
 
how penetrated you are in certain geographies. 
And then, as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should 
keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower margin 
services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and
 
the 
contribution to the bottom line.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, Shannon, I'll take it. Obviously, within the Services business, we have 
a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant 
growth right now. I said in my openi
ng comments that we grew 43% 13 
weeks over 13 weeks, a little even more for the quarter, right.
 
And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform. So 
we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets, where 
you expe
ct to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in 
places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the 
world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer 
community in a number of emerging markets. And s
o as we look, as I was 
explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing 
double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we 
think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth.
 
On the m
usic front, we are the market leader in digital music. Obviously 
now, by having the combination of the download business with the 
streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to 
bring our music business back to growth. We've grow
n over the last three 
quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original 
content. We've had very good success with exclusives. So we know that it's 
another business that we can grow.
 
Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickl
y, and so that is a 
business that also at a geographic level we can continue to grow 
significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes 
from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to 
grow very well, 
strong double digits. And as we've explained in the past, the 
vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell 
during the last 90 days. It's much more driven by the install base, and that 
gives us a tailwind. We're also opening u
p several new markets because we 
are accepting new forms of payment. And therefore, it's easier particularly 
for international customers to take advantage of our services.
 
You were asking about the margin profile. We said many times, in aggregate 
our Servi
ces business tends to have margins that are above company 
average. They are accretive, so they help us quite a bit from a margin 
standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin 
profiles, also because, as you know, we account for som
e of these services 
in different ways. In some cases, we transact on a buy/sell basis. In other 
cases, we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, and that 
drives different margin percentages.
 
Shannon S. Cross 
-
 
Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you. And 
then my follow
-
up is just in terms of the elasticity of 
demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. I think in the 
past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets the you were 
basically not able to 

 
you weren't you're getting the
 
volumes because you 
had to raise ASPs given the currency. But you talked about a lot of the 
emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I'm just 
curious. You raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus and that. What are you 
seeing, and what ar
e your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay 
up?
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Shannon, I was looking back. Since June of 2014, so we're talking about 2.5 
years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies 
where we do busine
ss. And so obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I've 
mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the 
revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's 
incredible. The level of interest for our pr
oducts continues to be 
phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There are more 
and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle 
class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly the strong 
dollar d
oesn't help us. And therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we 
need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance 
between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the 
dollar appreciates.

Brian J. White

Drexel Hamilton LLC
 
Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. Sales 
obviously beat the hi
gh end of your revenue range. It looks like gross 
margin was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the puts and takes in 
gross margins in the quarter, please?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Sure. We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margi
ns. We 
had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly. And really, 
the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to 
the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit 
more leverage out of the inc
reased revenue levels. We felt very good about 
the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keep in mind the strong dollar 
doesn't help us on that front.
 
Brian J. White

Drexel Hamilton LLC
 
Okay. And, Tim, I didn't hear much mentioned about India. How did In
dia 
perform with the iPhone? And how should we think about it for 2017, 
especially with the 4G network going up?
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
That's a really good question. Despite the demonetization move in India that 
created lots of economic pressur
e there last quarter, despite that, we had 
all
-
time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that. The 
demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. It's still 
definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it's
 
a great 
move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in 
discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to 
invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be.

Hi, thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in 
the 
quarter with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. I 
think you touched on the percent of switchers in China. But can you give a 
little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other 
regions and overall as well?
 
T
imothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Simona, it's Tim. We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that 
was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 
7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If yo
u look 
at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in 
any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that 
we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last 
year. However, I t
hink the big asterisk 

 
I share all this with you for 
transparency's sake. I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a 
quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many 
conclusions from it. But I wanted to share that wit
h you anyway so you have 
the backdrop.
 
Simona K. Jankowski

Thank you, and then just one follow
-
up on China specifically. As your comps 
get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning 
to growth in that reg
ion. And then just to give us the context, I know you 
talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland 
China. But curious if you strip out the double
-
digit increase in iPad and 
MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the iPhone 7 Plus
, I'm curious what 
underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
That's a big question, and I don't have the answer in front of me. If you look 
at iPhone 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. It 
set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, 
we don't provide guidance at the segment level. But sitting here today, for 
Q2, I wouldn't expect the year
-
over
-
year performance to be dramatically 
different than the year
-
over

yea
r performance in Q1. The real comp really 
begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have 
to see how that plays out as we get closer to it.

From Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. I just wanted to better understand the 
upgrade rate 
dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell
-
through basis were up about 8%. 
You had an extra week, which gave you about 8%. I understand there were 
differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments, it 
looks like iPhone 
units were probably up low single digits. But, Luca, you 
alluded to the fact that your install base was growing double digits. So that 
would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is 
actually declining.
 
And more specifically, I'd just 
like your broader perspective on how investors 
should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 
cycle, and it looks like they've been extending 

 
going lower. Replacement 
cycles have been extending over the last couple years. I 
think some of the 
U.S. carriers alluded to that as well.
 
So I'm wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more 
broadly about how investors should think about or what the trajectory has 
been over the last two years and how investors should
 
think going forward. 
Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve or 
replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the 
considerations we should think about?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I think it's a good q
uestion, a number of points that I want to make. Starting 
with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double 
digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact 
that it's a big driver for our Service
s business.
 
When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. 
For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in 
many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total 
company growth rate. But whe
n we look at a country
-
specific level, there 
were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where 
iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, 
where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are 
becoming 
more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in 
a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia 
but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in 
terms of units. So I 
think geographically we are seeing very, very good 
performance.
 
The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, 
clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell 
significantly more and significantly faster fr
om an upgrade cycle standpoint 
in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase 
prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? And you think about 
the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously that doesn't help 
us.
 
But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for 
and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new 
generation phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have 
upgraded to the new phone has been ve
ry similar to what we've seen last 
year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent
-
up 
demand for the larger screen phones. And certainly as we look ahead, we 
have a role to play. The more we're able to innovate with new generations of 
pr
oducts, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Okay, thank you. Tim, I have a question for you. Back in April 2012, you 
said on one of these earnings calls that I've always hated 
litigation and I 
continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. Yet you 
recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if 
you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, 
and what would b
e a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you 
can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as 
a result of this litigation.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. I don't li
ke litigation and view it as 
a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we 
didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for 
technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situ
ation 
where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or 
advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money 
Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be 
therefore for us to innovate.
 
And so it's somew
hat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a 
different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. Just 
from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will 
pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, as
 
a part of their increasingly 
radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 
billion in payments that they owed us. And so we felt like we had no choice 
was the net of it.
 
In terms of where it goes, we'll see. I don't like li
tigation. And so if there's 
another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. I fully 
expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think 
common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it i
s. And so 
that's the way I see it. Thanks for your question.

Thank you. First, I 
wanted to ask about the iPad. It looked like it was about 
to turn possibly even positive. You said it was above your plan, but I think it 
was pretty well below the Street's expectations. And the ASP deteriorated 
pretty significantly. I don't know if it's a
 
mix shift. But maybe you can talk 
about the iPad and what you see going forward.

The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million
-
unit swing on channel inventory 
between the years. In the year
-
ago quarter we increased by 900,000. In
 
this 
quarter we decreased by 700,000. On top of that and from an ASP point of 
view, in the year
-
ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. That would 
be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the 
channel fill plus the launc
h of the product, and so that would have bolstered 
the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under
-
call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that 
compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of 
our suppliers. And so 
all in all, there were quite a few things going on there.
 
If I zoom out of the 90
-
day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting 
things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take 
the product. When we look 
at the number of people buying iPads for the first 
time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things 
are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not 
close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbe
rs are through the roof. 
Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning.
 
And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still 
currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that 
tot
ally during the quarter. And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But 
again, beyond the 90
-
day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.

Okay, that's great, thank you. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the 
iPhon
e as mature and technology improvements as incremental, yet I 
believe you said there's plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new 
features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be 
viewed as material by users, and particularly ch
anges beyond form factor, 
beyond the way the phone looks? Are there functional things coming over 
time that you think could surprise people?

I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think 
there's
 
lots more to do. I think it's become 

 
every year it becomes more 
important to people's lives and there are more things people are doing with 
it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about 
health. I could have talked more a
bout CarPlay. The use of it in the 
enterprise is growing significantly. And so when I look at all of these things, 
usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting 
things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. So this
 
is one that 
we think different about a bunch of things, but maybe this is just one more.

creating the best products on earth. In the past 12 months around the world 

iPads and 21 million Macs setting new unit record
s and increasing our global 
market share for both iPhone and Mac.
 
We crossed 100 billion cumulative downloads from the App Store and we 
added powerful new services to our ecosystem, including Apple Pay in the 
United States, in the United Kingdom, Apple Mus
ic in over a 100 countries, 
and Apple News in the U.S.
 
We also entered an entirely new category with Apple Watch and we are in 
the very early innings of this promising new part of our business. We 
generated over $53 billion dollars in net income and grew e
arnings per share 
by 43%. We returned almost $50 billion to shareholders through dividends 
and share repurchases while continuing to invest confidently in research and 
development, marketing and distribution, our retail and online stores, our 
supply chain 
and our infrastructure.
 
We also completed 15 acquisitions to enhance and accelerate our roadmap 
for products and services. We accomplished all of these things while 
intensifying our efforts to protect the environment to promote equality and 
human rights an
d to ensure the security and privacy we know our customers 
deserve.
 
We are ending the year on a high note with a record breaking September 
quarter including sales of 48 million iPhones beating our expectations and up 
22% year

6 and iPhone 6 Plus remained 
very strong across the quarter and we established a new launch record for

We exited the quarter with demand for our new iPhones exceeding supply 

gress with our manufacturing ramp in the initial 
weeks of October. We sold an all time record 5.7 million Macs continuing to 
defy the negative trend in the global personal computer market which IDC 
estimates contracted by 11%.
 
The App Store set new all

tim
e quarterly records for both the number of 
transacting customers and overall revenue. The strong performance of the 
App Store helped fuel $5.1 billion in services revenue also an all
-
time record.
 
Sales of Apple Watch were also up sequentially and were ahea
d of our 
expectations. This quarter we introduced beautiful new Apple Watch cases 
and bands including new Gold and Rose Gold aluminum Apple Watch Sport 
models. We released Watch OS 2 in September paving the way for a whole 
new class of native apps that are
 
faster and can take advantage of the 
hardware capabilities of Apple Watch such as the microphone, speaker and 
the heart rate sensor.
 
Today, there are over 13,000 apps in the Watch App Store including over 
1300 native apps such as Facebook messenger, MLB A
t Bat and Runkeeper 
and the number is growing rapidly.
 


I personally heard from people who credit Apple 
Watch with saving their 
lives and customers are finding new applications all the time in their day to 
day activities.
 
Revenue in Greater China nearly doubled year
-
over
-
year and we continue to 
focus and invest heavily there. I just returned from a four day 
visit to 
Hangzhou and Beijing where we announced major new initiatives to provide 
renewable energy for our supply chain. I also visited our retail stores in 
China which are among the busiest in the world.
 
On Saturday we opened a new store, our 25th in Grea
ter China to a very 
enthusiastic crowd and we are on track to achieve our goal of 40 stores by 
the middle of next year. Yesterday, we started taking orders for the all new 
Apple TV and it was a huge first day for this exciting new product. We want 
to provi
de the same innovation in the living room that we delivered in our 
iOS devices. People are already watching more TV through apps today and 

around this vision with a new operating system
 
called tvOS innovative ways 
to connect with your screen and a smart use of Siri to search for what to 
watch.
 

ever made. iPad Pro will enable a new generation of apps for entertainment
 
and productivity, design and illustration, engineering and medical and much 
more, and with the Apple Pencil and Smart keyboards users can customize 
their experience making iPad Pro an even more powerful tool for everyone 
from students to artists, to busin
ess professionals.
 
iOS 9 has hit the ground running on track to be downloaded by more users 

already running at less than six weeks after its September the 16th release.
 
In late Sep
tember, we also launched OS X El Capitan which has made the 
world most advanced desktop operating system more refined and powerful 
than ever before. Apple Music has set a completely new standard, redefining 
and combining the best ways to enjoy music in a s
ingle immersive app. Over 
15 million individual and family accounts are experiencing Apple music 
including over 6.5 million paying customers. We are thrilled to bring Apple 
Music to China beginning this quarter along with iTunes, movies and iBooks 
and we a
re especially happy to offer such great new and diverse content to 
our large highly engaged and rapidly growing customer base in China.
 
We are also looking forward to bringing Apple Music to the new Apple TV 
beginning this week. Apple Pay is seeing double 
digit growth in transaction 
month after month and we continue to add major businesses including 
Starbucks which will roll out Apple Pay support to all its U.S. stores in 2016.
 
Apple Pay now supports merchant rewards programs as well and popular 
retailers t
hat will be coming online in the next few weeks. We are thrilled to 
announce today that we are partnering with American Express to bring Apple 
Pay to eligible customers in key global markets so even more people can 
experience the easy, secure and private w
ay to pay.
 
Apple Pay will be available to eligible American Express customers in 
Australia, in Canada this year and is expected to expand to Spain, Singapore 
and Hong Kong in 2016. The reach of our ecosystem continues to grow and 
iOS is changing more 

meaningful ways from their health, to their homes, to their cars.
 
In Health, there are now more than 1,600 health kit enabled solutions that 
are helping us live a healthier day. In the home there are over 50
 
brands 
working on home kit enabled accessories that can be privately and securely 
controlled from your iPad and iPhone, and in the car more than 50 
automobile models have been announced with CarPlay support which 
provides a smarter, safer and more fun way
 
to use iPhone in the car. And we 
will continue to work to make the iOS experience even more meaningful 
across more touch points of our daily lives.
 
The impact of research kit also continues to build. We recently announced 
new studies on autism, epilepsy a
nd melanoma adding to the important 
studies already underway on conditions from asthma to diabetes to 

 
Our iOS news app is off to a great start. Nearly 40 million people are reading 

ck from the 
publishers. We have now signed more than 70 publishers representing 

the United Kingdom and Australia with partners such as the BBC, NewsCorp, 
The Telegraph, The Guardian,
 
Financial Times, Daily Mail and the Australian 
Broadcasting Service.
 
And finally, we are making great strides in the enterprise market, 
announcing a new strategic partnership with Cisco in September while 
furthering our progress with IBM in building our m
obility partners program. 
We estimate that enterprise markets accounted for about $25 billion in 
annual Apple revenue in the last 12 months, up 40% over the prior year and 
they represent a major growth vector for the future.

results in more detail.
 
Luca Maestri
 

fiscal 2015 with our strongest September quarter ever. Revenue for the 
quarter was $51.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion or 22% year 
over year. 
Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the 
expanded availability of Apple Watch and all time high services revenue and 
Mac sales.
 
We achieved these outstanding results despite severe and persisting 
weakness in foreign exc
hange rates around the world that affected all our 
geographic segments and this makes our year
-
over
-
year growth rates even 
more remarkable.
 
In constant currency, our growth during the fourth quarter would have been 
800 basis points higher. We once again re
ported very strong numbers in 
Greater China with revenue growing 99% year
-
over
-
year to $12.5 billion. 
Emerging markets performance was strong overall up 65% year
-
over
-
year 
and representing 31% of total company revenue for the quarter.
 
Company gross margin 
was 39.9%, up sequentially better than our 
expectations, mainly due to lower than expected costs. Operating margin 
was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $11.1 billion, a new September 
quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.96, a 38% year
-
over
-
year increase and cash flow from operations was $13.5 billion, also a new 
fourth quarter record.
 
For details by product I'll start with iPhone. We sold 48 million iPhones in the 
quarter, up 22% year over year with strong performance around the world 
throu
ghout the quarter. Total iPhone sales were up 120% in Mainland China 
and grew over 35% in South Asia and increased by over 20% in several 
markets around the world including Germany and Italy.
 
iPhone ASP was $670, an increase of $67 year
-
over
-
year, thanks t
o more 
favorable mix and in spite of the very significant negative impact from 
foreign exchange that I referred to earlier.
 
We increased iPhone channel inventory by less than 2 million units in order 
to support our new product launch at the very end of Sep
tember quarter. 
We exited the quarter with demand exceeding supply and channel inventory 
below our target range of 5 to 7 weeks.
 
Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.7 million Macs, which is an all 
time quarterly record and represents 3% year
-
ove
r
-
year growth. We 
extended our very long running trend of PC market share gains based on 
IDC's latest estimate of a 11% global market contraction. Mac growth was 
driven primarily by the great customer response to our new MacBook and 
sales of MacBook Pro al
so remained strong. We ended the quarter below our 
4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory.
 
Turning to iPad. We sold 9.9 million compared to 12.3 million in the year
-
ago quarter. iPad sell
-
through was 10.4 million as we reduced channel 
inventory
 
by about 500,000 units. We exited the quarter below our 5 to 7 
week target range of iPad channel inventory.
 
iPad customer metrics remain extremely positive. In August, ChangeWave 
measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among 
consumers
 
planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 70% planned to 
purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad 
and a 90 day purchase intent of 73%.
 
In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be 
very su
ccessful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 73% share of 
the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published 
by IDC indicates that iPad has 74% share of the U.S. Commercial Tablet 
market.
 
As Tim mentioned our enterprise 
initiatives continue to expand. In 
September we announced a new strategic partnership with Cisco to optimize 
their networks for iOS devices with a goal of providing iOS mobile users with 
great performance advantage over other mobile platforms.
 
Also, during
 
the September quarter, IBM released new mobile first for iOS 
apps in healthcare, financial services, travel and transportation and 
industrial sectors, including new apps leveraging iOS 9 and Watch OS 2.
 
There are now 55 apps in the IBM mobile first for iO
S catalogue and the list 
of projects signings is growing rapidly. Inside IBM, Macs are gaining 
tremendous traction. There are currently over 30,000 Macs deployed within 
the company with 1,900 more being added each week. IBM tells us that 
each Mac is saving
 
$270 compared to a traditional PC, thanks to the much 
reduced support cost and better residual value. This is a terrific example of 
the kind of opportunity our devices offer to improve user experience and 
create value in the enterprise world.
 
Our mobility
 
partner program also continues to grow with more than 25 new 
partners added in the September quarter bringing the total to over 65 and 
we are already seeing some great success stories with this program. We are 
also very excited about the potential of iPad
 
Pro and the enterprise. For 
example, with the Bloomberg professional app, more than 325,000 financial 
professionals will be able to use iPad Pro to gain instant global access to 
finance and business news, market data and portfolio tracking and trading 
too
ls.
 
Turning to services. We generated $5.1 billion in revenue, a new all
-
time 
record, and an increase of 10% over last year mainly due to strong growth 
from apps. The revenue from the App Store increased 25% and the number 
of transacting customers grew 18%
, also setting an all
-
time record. Services 
growth was particularly impressive in China, where Apple App Store revenue 
grew by 127% year
-
over
-
year. The momentum behind the App Store in 
China has been tremendous with huge interest from developers and 
custom
ers alike. Our developer program in China has grown dramatically in 
the last year with over 1 million members in our program today.
 
Revenue from other products grew strongly up 61% over last year, thanks 
to the growing contribution from Apple Watch. We exp
anded Apple Watch 
distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and it was available 
at almost 5000 locations in 32 countries at quarter end.
 
Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter. We opened 7 new 
stores, including our first stor
e in Belgium. That brought us to a global store 
count of 463 of which 195 are in 15 countries outside the United States.
 
In fiscal 2016, we expect to open or replace between 40 and 50 stores and 
we continue to place particular emphasis on Greater China whe
re we plan to 
have 40 stores opened by the middle of next year.
 
Customers have been very interested in the iPhone upgrade program offered 
in our U.S. retail stores. The iPhone upgrade program gives customer 
purchasing a connected device an easy convenient 
way to get a new phone 
every year with low monthly payments to a third party lender along with the 
security and protection of AppleCare Plus.
 
After making 12 or more installment payments, customers can upgrade to a 
new iPhone. Let me also quickly discuss three accounting matters. First, 
relative to the iPhone upgrade program that I just mentioned, we will be 
reducing revenue at the time of sale 
for the cost associated with the 
program and deferring the portion of revenue related to AppleCare software 
upgrade rights and non software services for each iPhone sold.
 
Second, in September based on an analysis of market offerings we reduced 
the estimate
d selling price of future software upgrade rights and non 
software services that we defer for each iOS device and Mac sold, the 
reduction is between $5 and $10 per unit.
 
Third, also in September we lengthened the time period over which the 
deferred revenue
 
associated to iPads will be recognized from two years to 
three years.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $205.7 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $2.8 
billion. $187 billion of this cash, or 9
1% of the total, was outside of the 
United States. In the September quarter, we issued a total of $5.8 billion of 
term debt, consisting of 1.25 billion British pound denominated notes, 2.25 
billion Australian dollar denominated notes and 2 billion euro den
ominated 
notes.
 
This left us with $56 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the 
quarter.
 
We were very active in the market during the quarter and returned over $17 
billion to our investors. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and 
we sp
ent $14 billion to repurchase almost 122 million Apple shares through 
open market transactions. We also completed our fifth accelerated share 
repurchase program in July and retired an additional 10 million shares at 
settlement.
 
We have now completed over $
143 billion of our $200 billion program 
including $104 billion in share repurchases of which $36 billion was 
repurchased in fiscal 2015 alone. Now, as we move ahead into December 
quarter, I like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward 
loo
king information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We 
expect revenue to be between $75.5 and $77.5 billion compared to $74.6 
billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 39% 
and 40%. We expect OpEx to be between 
$6.3 billion and $6.4 billion. We 
expect OI&E to be about $400 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 
26.2%.
 
Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per 
share of common stock payable on November 12, 2015 to sharehold
ers of 
record as of November 09, 2015.
 
With that, let's open the call to questions.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one, one

[Operation Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with 
Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Yes, thanks, good afternoon. In light of December quarter revenue guidance, 
firmly low single digit revenue growth and what looks like
 
increasingly tough 
comps heading into the March quarter, how do you get comfortable that 

And then I have a follow up.
 
Tim Cook
 

urrency growth rates. And 
so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have 
about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1. And so the growth is actually 

struggling with
 
it.
 

currently. We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what 
we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on 
record for Android switches 
last quarter at 30%.
 
We also look at the number of people that have upgraded, that were in the 
installed base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. And that number is in the low 30 
percentages. So we feel like we have a very open field in front of us. Our 
performa

was good our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets 
is quite low.
 
Also, if I zoom out and look at China, as I have said before and just to make 
the point once again is w
e see an enormous change in China over the next 
several years. The latest study I have seen from Mackenzie indicates if you 

you look ahead five years, it will have ten times th
at number in it. And so 
--
 

do better, but I think we are doing fairly well there.
 

impressed last quarter wit
h our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India 
among others. Also, from the currency point of view and the weak global 

-
 

transitional kind of thing and we invest for the long 
term, so we are 

 
In addition to those Apple TV is off to a great start. Apple Watch is just 
getting going. The app store hit a new record again last quarter and the 

appy with the early days 
of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music 
business. And finally, the enterprise business is not to be underestimated, I 
doubt very many people knew that we had $25 billion enterprise business 
that we qui
etly built in not too many years, but our penetration is low, but 
we have significant actions going on to really deepen that. So sort of 
everywhere I look I see significant opportunity. Long answer but I thought 
you might be interested.
 
Katy Huberty
 
No. I 
appreciate that. Just as a follow
-
up on growth, if you look at large 
services companies, Facebook, Amazon, Google, they're all growing over 
20% and it's largely driven by activity of Apple users on iOS devices. Do you 
feel like there is more that Apple can
 
do to participate in that services 
growth or you relegated to fundamentals that are tied to device upgrade 
cycles?
 
Tim Cook
 
Well, the App Store is growing over 20%, it grew 25% last quarter, and so 
we feel very good about that. That's become a sizeable bu
siness. I would 
also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market, 
they sort of began to look more like a subscription business in terms of the 
way they operate. And so we think that in the aggregate that they may 
reduce upgrade cyc
les and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone 
else hits the price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help 
further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you very much.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yep.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Katy. May we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.
 
Gene Munster
 
Good afternoon and congratulations. Tim, you just briefly touched on as 
reducing the time between upgrades, bu
t how do you think about the iPhone 
upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years, obviously the impact 

bit about when that's going to be rolled out internationally? And then l
astly, 
Luca you mentioned some of the accounting changes related to the iPhone 
upgrade program. Any sense in terms of what percentage of the Plus 

 
the s 
upgrades were associated with the upgrade program? Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
Gene, in terms of the upgrade prog
ram it's early, but here's what we believe 
our current view is that we do think that the broader upgrade program, so 
I'm not just talking about our program that in retail, I mean, that is 
relatively small compared to our total iPhone sales of the company, 
but the 
broader thing obviously is that many of the carriers are offering these plans. 
And that, if you look at them in the aggregate, we think that it would have a 
positive impact in replacement cycles. We do like the fact that it creates a 
market for an 
iPhone at a different price point as well that is a better product 
than that customer maybe currently buying which would further help from 
an ecosystem point of view and that's not to be underestimated.
 
It also seems like that from a rollout point of view 
there's a 
--
 
you will see 
these plans offered in a significant way in the United States already, but in 
fact these plans are being offered in some derivation in over dozen countries 
in the world. They're not as pervasive as they are in the U.S. but it seem
s 

 
Luca Maestri
 
From a financial perspective, Gene, the transaction on our iPhone upgrade 

upfront, of course we deduc
t also upfront the cost associated with the 
program essentially to provide interest free financing and we need to 
estimate deferred value of the upgrade option for the customer, but as Tim 


small percentage of our worldwide iPhone sales and so we'll have really a 
negligible impact for example, on ASPs for the phone.
 
Gene Munster
 
And Tim, if we put it all together is it something that has more measurable 
impact on the business two,
 
three quarters down the road, is that the right 
way to generally think about it?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes, we think about it as being 

 
there were some clearly that were offered 
in the market prior to this cycle. But they became much more pervasive and 
much communica
ted, I think much wider with the September 
announcements. And so, I would sort of expect to begin seeing this 
somewhere around a year from now.
 
Gene Munster
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Gene. May we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Moving on,
 
we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes. Thank you. Tim, I appreciated the color that you provided on the 
drivers of iPhone growth in Q1. I think the investor concern is that Q1 will 
benefit at least on a year over year basis f
rom three extra weeks of 
availability in China. And it will also benefit from more of those initial launch 
days that only two of them were in the September quarter and the 
remainder will be in the December quarter.
 
And so I guess the investor concern is De
cember is a structurally 
advantaged quarter in the sense of benefiting from both of those tailwinds 
on a year
-
over
-
year basis. But if we look out beyond December, wouldn't 
that point to notably lower seasonal growth than the March quarter. And 
how do we th
ink about the factors affecting unit growth beyond the 
December quarter? And then I have a follow
-
up, please.
 
Tim Cook
 
We don't guide beyond December, as you know Toni. I do think that the sort 
of the macro things that I spoke about earlier, the 
upgrade programs, the 
Android Switcher rate, the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and 
the LTE penetration in these markets these trends are not one quarter 
things. These are longer term things. The same 

 
my same response applies 
and I think we'll d
o quite good in iPhone. I do believe we'll grow this quarter 
as we put in our guidance that when you start with a number in the low 30s 

phone pre the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, that numb
er still likely to leave a lot of 
headroom beyond December.
 
So that's how I look at that. In terms of your first comment, you didn't 
asked me to comment on that, but just to be clear, our forecasting doesn't 
work like you articulated it. I recognize that p
eople can have their own 
models and so forth, but just to make it clear that I'm not agreeing with 
your point.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Okay. And then just on the follow
-
up, the reported gains from currency 
hedging in fiscal year 2015 were significant, several bill
ion dollar 
contribution to the company. And again, this is not an Apple's specific issue, 
Luca as you pointed out several times, but how do we think about this 
notion of currency hedges effectively rolling off and being replaced with 
hedges that are likely
 
have less of an impact. How do we think about that 
impact the P&L on a go forward basis, perhaps starting with Q1, but then 
qualitatively or directionally over the course of the year? And what is some 
of kinds of things that you've undertaken or planning 
to undertake that could 
mitigate some of those concerns?
 
Luca Maestri
 

practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge comp such that over time 
provides protection to our margins 
and to our results, but that protection 
diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that in over 
time during the course of fiscal 2016 that protection will come off assuming 
that the dollar stays at current levels. Keep in mind, there are 
some 
currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge and 
so those currencies are bit excluded from what we're talking about right 
now.
 
I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first 
quarter that 39% to 40%
 
it actually an incredible level of guidance given the 
foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with. How do we deal with 
that? We continue to hedge, so our program continues on an ongoing basis 
and we will continue to provide some level of protection
 
to foreign exchange 
movement. In some cases we have realign prices particularly when we 
launch new products. We tend to do that in a number of countries where the 
foreign exchange moves have been particularly extreme, and so we tend to 
recover that throug
h pricing.
 
And then finally, of course we are putting in place a number of cost 
initiatives that would allow us to deal with the foreign exchange situation. 
So, overall we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter. And beyond 
the first quarter as you
 
know we're not guiding and so we'll see over the 
course of the year.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much. 
Tim, I wanted to go back to your commentary on the 
enterprise business, $25 billion I think you said, it was up 40% year
-
over
-
year. I know you have a relatively small sales force internally and obviously 
you utilizing the joint ventures, but as you noted y
ou see that's an important 
driver of growth. So, how do you attack that market going forward? Will 
there be changes? Is there something that you need to shift or focus product 
in a little bit of different directions to make sure you can adequately attack 
i
t. Just in general how you're thinking about it?
 
Tim Cook
 
From a product point of view, we'd actually been continuing to change and 
improve IOS for some time. With every release they are more enterprise 
features and so, I would describe it as sort of conti
nuation of that cadence 
perhaps with little more intensity. From a go to market point of view, we will 
be working with or are working with IBM. With Cisco. We're already working 
with 75 mobility partners that are principally in the U.S. but that's expandin
g 
quickly to international as well.
 
And so, many of these companies have 
--
 
in some cases very large sales 
forces, in many cases the reasonable seize sales force. And in addition to a 
direct sales force there is a huge worldwide indirect channel that many 
customers buy from and count on buying some services from. And so I do 
not envision Apple's having a large enterprise sales force will certainly make 

 
we continue adding some people more on the engineering side, but I don't 
envision having a large direct 
sales force.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Okay, great. Thank you. And can you give us some more color on China, 
120% year
-
over
-
year growth in iPhones, but can you talk in general about 
what you're seeing in the marketplace and perhaps where you think you in 
terms of pene
tration from a smartphone standpoint especially with a China 
Mobile which has a substantial opportunity to grow given the LTE 
penetration?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes. If you look at China, we grew from an iPhone point of view, Greater 
China, we grew 87% the market grew 
for. If you take iPhone out of the 
market number, the certain market x iPhone actually contracted slightly. 
And so, we've been able to grow without the market growing. iPhone 6 was 
the number one selling smartphone in Mainland, China last quarter and 
iPhon
e 6 Plus was number three. And so, we did fairly well. The sort of the 
economic question which I know there's a bit lot of attention on, frankly, if I 
were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many 
customers are coming in our stores reg
ardless to whether they're buying, 
how many people are coming online, and in addition looking at our sales 
trend,
 
I wouldn't know if there was any economic issue at all in China. And so I 
don't know how unusual we are with that. I think that there's a 
misu
nderstanding probably particularly in the Western world about China's 

growing as fast as it was, but I also don't think that Apple's results are 
largely dependent on minor changes t

contributing 

 
I think other things contribute to that much more. That does 
say, you'll never had problem there, because the economy, I'm not saying, 
I'm dumb enough to think that. But I just think that the area that i
t's 
currently operating within, it's hard to tell the difference of the consumer 
level for us. I mean, you really can't tell the difference, if you look at sort of 
our daily and weekly numbers.
 
So, we're very bullish on it, and I would point out that we're
 
investing in 
China not for next or the quarter after, or the quarter after, we're investing 
for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will 
be Apple's top market in the world. And that's not just for sales, that's also 
develope
r community is growing faster than any other country in the world. 
And so, the ecosystem there is very, very strong. I was very impressed with 
the number the developers I met last week and of course, the customers in 
stores are enthusiastically contagious.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Shannon. Can we have next question, please?
 
Operator
 
We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS
 
Steve Milunovich
 
Thank you. Tim, I wanted to talk about the two sources of your iPhone 
demand selling to current customers and 
selling to new customers. In terms 
of selling to current customers you indicated about a third of the base is 
moved to the sixth line. As much as people talk about that been a huge 
upgrade cycle and what is the six has have incrementally, 33% not that a 
bi
gger number, I would have thought it would be bigger than that.
 
Does this suggest that there is maybe more of a consistency to upgrading 
than the street perceives. And then on the other side in terms of new 
customers, just wanted clarity on the switcher nu
mber, are you saying that 
30% of iPhone shipments in the quarter went to android switchers to IOS. 
And do you believe that you could actually have more new customers to 
Apple in fiscal 2016 than you had fiscal 2015.
 
Tim Cook
 
There's a lot there. Let me sta
rt with the Android Switcher. What this means 
is that for customers to purchase an iPhone last quarter and replace the 
smartphone that 30% of those switched from an android device. And so 
there would have been some switchers on top of that from other opera
ting 
systems, but obviously android is the largest one by far. And so that's what 
that means, and that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since 
we began measuring it three or so years ago.
 

hat number. In terms 
of 2016 versus 2015 new customers, it's hard to predict. I'm very happy 
with how we're doing. We're doing better than we've ever been doing. 
People 
--
 
I know there's a fixation on the upgrade rate. When I look at the 
upgrade rate, Stev

that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there 
prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year. 
That's a large number.
 
And so, I'd see that is
 
opportunity. Do I think it has anything, does to length 
to consistency? I think part of it is and I believe that the iPhone upgrade 
plans that are out there as I've mentioned before it seems to me on the 


catalyst to accelerate some of this upgrades. And I think that's not 
something that we're going to see this quarter or next quarter, but it seems 

 
It have begins to be 

 
y
ou've seen the plan. They look more and active like 
a subscription than they do like a purchase. And that's great for the 
customer because many of them want to upgrade on a frequent basis and 
they can do this very, very simply. In terms of new, I don't kno
w, whether 
we'll more new or not. I can tell you that that's always our objective. We 
want to add a lot more people to the ecosystem and certainly if you look in 
the emerging markets, even like, nobody is asking about iPad on the call. 
But if you look at i
Pad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that 
purchased an iPad it was the first tablet they've owned and 40% of those 
have never owned any Apple product.
 
Just to go through one product with one set of number. I don't want to get 
through a bunch
 
of numbers because it does contain the data than I don't 
want to share. But these are things that we're very focused on. And the first 
time buyer number is surprisingly strong. And keep in mind that we have a 
good history of bunch of people buy one Apple 
product, they have a great 
experience. They begin to look at other Apple products. And of course we 
makes they all work well together.
 
Steve Milunovich
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Steve. Could we have next question, please?
 
Operator
 
From 
Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Simona Jankowski.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Hi. Thank you very much. Just is a follow
-
up to that last question and to put 
that in context, roughly what percent of the iPhone shipments come from 
shipments for the installed based versus fro
m your user shipment?
 
Tim Cook
 
I don't know the answer of your question.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Okay. And then just a follow
-
up, as Luca mentioned, you had to make some 
adjustments to the pricing in various regions given the currency move we've 
had. What had bee
n the response in terms of demand, I guess both in terms 
of units and revenues in some of these regions like Japan or India, parts of 
Europe where the local prices has to go up?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Simona, we've made a number of price changes during the course of
 
fiscal 
2015. What we've seen in a normal of these markets, we've seen that 
iPhone sales have been very resilient and that shown in our growth rates. 
Most recently we've adjusted some prices around the world for the launch of 
iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. We are 
very positive about the safest trends around 

four weeks, so its bit early to tell there. Obviously when we increase prices 
around the world, it's normal to see some impact on s
ales rates, but so far 
we were encouraged by the response.
 
Tim Cook
 
Let me go back to your question. And this is an exactly what you're asking 
that what your view, I think some color is. The reason I can't answer this is, 
we don't look at any aggregate, we
 
actually look at the detailed because it's 
much more important for to us to look at, buy iPhone model by country, 
what percentage going to our first iPhone buyers. Somebody that's never 
owned an iPhone before. And so if you look at China as an example, it
's over 
50% of people that bought 6 and 6 Plus were buying their first iPhone.
 
As you move down the line, that numbers goes up. And so a 5s generally 
speaking is higher in most countries. And so, that gives a feel for very 
important market and we cannot wh
ere the numbers are.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Great. Thank you very much.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Simona. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Next we'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon 
guys. Two questions from me as well. I guess, 
first could you talk about the gross margin dynamic as you go from 
September to December, the midpoint implies on 20 basis points. I think the 
last five years that's only happen once the gross margin is going d
own in 
fiscal Q1. Can you just talk about what the FX dynamic or what area the 
other headwinds that you think that implies gross margins being done in 
December?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes. Let me give you puts and takes for margins for the December quarter. 
On the posit
ive side, of course as you mentioned that we would have 
positive leverage from the higher seasonal volumes. Also what we've seen 
over the last several quarters is a commodity environment that has been 
quite favorable and we expect it to remain favorable du
ring the December 
quarter.
 

launched some during September. We are launching some now and 
everything we launch new products, we make them better. We had features 
and new technology a
nd these products when we launch and tend to have 
higher cost structures than the products what they replaced. We have a very 
good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures, but every time 
we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the be
ginning of the cycle 
for gross margin.
 

exchange impact that we have mentioned before it remains a very 
significant headwind as I mentioned earlier to Tony I believe we are dealing 
wit
h that to a combination of hedging, price realignments [ph] cost 
initiatives, but on a net basis foreign exchange we will clearly by a 
sequential headwind.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Got it. And then Tim when you talk about seeing iPhone growth in fiscal Q1, 

us is that statement more reflective of iPhone units or iPhone 
revenues so that the ASPs could hardly get growth even if units are not 
there. And then would you expect to exit within the 5 to 7 week optimal 
inventory range in fiscal Q1?
 
Tim Cook
 

ow that we will exit. We make that call late in the quarter as we 
see what the demand is because we are actually trying to position the 

very difficult to predict. What was your ot
her question?
 
Amit Daryanani
 
I was just curious to your statement on iPhone growth in fiscal Q1, is that a 

 
Tim Cook
 
Is it revenue? I was making a revenue statement but units are also, yes we 
expect units to be up as well.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Tha
nk you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 

 
Rod Hall
 
Yes thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask Tim maybe if you 
could comment on the mix between 
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. And whether 
the mix of demand is any different than what you say for instance that the 
iPhone 5, 5s point whether there is more say iPhone 6, I know you 
highlighted that the iPhone 6 is a number one phone in China for example 
and th
en I have a follow up?
 
Tim Cook
 
The statement I made in China was about Q4 and the 6s was only available 
in China for two days last quarter. The iPhone 6s is the most popular iPhone 
that we currently sell. In terms of has there been a change. If you look a
t 

are doing better, at that price point than we were previously.
 
Rod Hall
 

upgrade program. I am wondering
 
if can you envision a time ever made in 
the U.S. or elsewhere where you would not have to come into an Apple store 
to activate it or to take advantage of the upgrade you might be able to do 

 
Tim Cook
 

 
a really good question. We actually solved that problem back in 2007. 
But then quickly had to change it in order to scale in a major way. And so 
that is something that we would always 
--
 
sort of always in our mind that 
one day from a customer experience p
oint of view we would like to make 
things as easy as possible for the customer.
 
And to some degree you can already do that with buying online. But there 
are many different plans and search what the people buy, that they have to 
come in for several times we
 
would love to have that automated and 
working with our partners, with service providers.
 
Rod Hall
 
Great. Thank you very much.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes.

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us.
 
Today we're proud to announce very strong results for our fiscal third 
quarter, with 
unit and revenue growth in all of our product categories. We'll 
review our financial performance in detail, and I'd also like to talk about 
some of the major announcements we made in June at our Worldwide 
Developers Conference. It was our biggest and best 
WWDC ever, and the 
advances we introduced across hardware, software, and services will help us 
to delight our customers and extend our competitive lead this fall and well 
into the future.
 
For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance r
ange at 
$45.4 billion. That's an increase of 7% over last year, so our growth rate has 
accelerated in three successive quarters this fiscal year. Gross margin was 
also at the high end of our guidance, and we generated a 17% increase in 
earnings per share.
 
iPhone results were impressive, with especially strong demand at the high 
end of our lineup. iPhone 7 was our most popular iPhone, and sales of 
iPhone 7 Plus were up dramatically compared to iPhone 6s Plus in the June 
quarter of last year. The combined iPh
one 7 and iPhone 7 Plus family was up 
strong double digits year over year. One decade after the initial iPhone 
launch, we have now surpassed 1.2 billion cumulative iPhones sold.
 
Services revenue hit an all
-
time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, representin
g 
22% growth over last year. We continue to see great performance all around 
the world, with double
-
digit growth in each of our geographic segments. 
Over the last 12 months, our Services business has become the size of a 
Fortune 100 company, a milestone we
've reached even sooner than we had 
expected.
 
We had very positive results for iPad, with broad
-
based growth in units, 
revenue, and market share. iPad sales were up 15% year over year and 
grew across all of our geographic segments. We achieved our highest 
global 
market share in over four years based on IDC's latest estimate of tablet 
market results for the June quarter. And in markets like China and Japan, 
over half of iPads sold were to people buying their very first iPad.
 
Our iPad product lineup is strong
er than ever. The new iPad we launched in 
March offers great value and performance. And the all
-
new 10.5
-
inch iPad 
Pro, launched in June, features the world's most advanced display with 
ProMotion technology and is more powerful than most PC desktops. iPad 
is 
the perfect tool for teaching in new and compelling ways, and our iPad 
results were especially strong in the U.S. education market, where sales 
were up 32% year over year to over 1 million units.
 
We believe that coding is an essential skill that all stu
dents should learn. 
We're thrilled that over 1.2 million students of all ages are now using iPad 
and Swift Playgrounds to learn the fundamentals of coding. And over 1,000 
K
-
12 schools across the United States plan to use Apple's Everyone Can 
Code in their 
curricula this fall. And for high school and community college 
students who want to pursue careers in the fast
-
growing app economy, we 
announced app development with Swift, an innovative full
-
year curriculum 
designed by Apple engineers and educators and pr
ovided free to schools to 
teach students to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job 
skills in software development and information technology.
 
I'd like to turn now to Mac, which gained global unit market share and 
reached new June quart
er unit sales records in mainland China and Japan. 
Mac revenue grew 7% year over year, driven by the strength of the 
MacBook Pro and iMac despite IDC's latest estimate of a 4% unit contraction 
in the global PC market. And with the refresh of almost our ent
ire Mac lineup 
in June, we're off to a great start for the back
-
to
-
school season.
 
Sales of Apple Watch were up over 50% in the June quarter, and it's the 
number one selling smartwatch in the world by a very wide margin. Apple 
Watch is having a positive imp
act on people's health and daily lives and 
motivating them to sit less and move more. With features like built
-
in GPS 
and waterproofing, Apple Watch Series 2 is the perfect companion for hiking, 
running, and swimming.
 
We're also seeing incredible enthusias
m for AirPod, with 98% customer 
satisfaction based on Creative Strategy's survey. We have increased 
production capacity for AirPods and are working very hard to get them to 
customers as quickly as we can, but we are still not able to meet the strong 
level 
of demand.
 
We made some big announcements during the June quarter that I'd like to 
quickly review. We launched a new investment in the future through our 
Advanced Manufacturing Fund. We've earmarked at least $1 billion for this 
program, aimed at helping ou
r manufacturing partners develop innovative 
production capabilities and create high
-
skill jobs in the United States. We 
believe this can lay the foundation for a new era of technology
-
driven 
manufacturing in the U.S. The first $200 million from the fund ha
s been 
committed to Corning to support R&D, capital equipment needs, and state
-
of
-
the
-
art glass processing.
 
And as we announced at WWDC, we have a very exciting fall ahead, with 
stunning advances in iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, and watchOS4. iOS 11 will 
make
 
iPhones better than ever with Apple Pay peer
-
to peer payments, an 
even more intelligent and natural Siri, new expressive messages with full 
screen effects, richer and more powerful maps, enhanced live photos and 
memories and portrait mode effects, and muc
h, much more. iOS 11 will also 
take the iPad experience to a whole new level, with features such as a 
customizable dock, Multi
-
Touch drag and drop, powerful new multitasking, 
more efficient QuickTime, and great new markup and scanning capabilities.
 
One of 
the most exciting and most promising announcements from WWDC 
was the introduction of ARKit, a new set of tools for developers to create 
augmented reality apps. It's still early in the beta period, but it's clear that 
ARKit has captured the imagination of o
ur developer community. We think 
ARKit will help the most creative minds in the industry tap into the latest 
computer vision technologies to build engaging content.
 
We believe AR has broad mainstream applicability across education, 
entertainment, interacti
ve gaming, enterprise, and categories we probably 
haven't even thought of. With hundreds of millions of people actively using 
iPhone and iPad today, iOS will become the world's biggest augmented 
reality platform as soon as iOS 11 ships.
 
With iOS 11, we're 
also bringing the power of machine learning to all Apple 
developers with Core ML, enabling capabilities like face detection, object 
tracking, and natural language interpretation. Core ML lets developers 
incorporate machine learning technologies into their 
apps with all the 
processing done right on device, so it respects our customers' data and 
privacy.
 
For Mac, we provided a peek at the immersive gaming, 3D, and virtual 
reality experiences made possible with the upcoming release of macOS High 
Sierra and the
 
amazingly powerful new iMac Pro. We're proud to make the 
best personal computers in the industry and are very excited to deliver even 
more innovation in the months to come.
 
Apple Watch will become more intelligent than ever this fall with watchOS4, 
featur
ing a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an 
entirely new music experience. watchOS4 also introduces GymKit, a 
groundbreaking technology program to connect workouts with cardio 
equipment.
 
We also previewed HomePod, a breakthrough
 
wireless speaker for the home 
that delivers amazing audio quality and uses spatial awareness to sense its 
location in the room and adjust the audio automatically. Visitors to our 
listening room at WWDC were blown away by the HomePod's incredible 
sound, wh
ich is unlike any other wireless home speaker on the market. With 
deep knowledge of music, HomePod is designed to work with your Apple 
Music subscription to help you enjoy the music you already love as well as to 
discover great new music, based on your per
sonal preferences.
 
As an intelligent home assistant, HomePod is a great way to send messages, 
set a timer, get updates on news, sports, and weather, or control smart 
home kit devices by simply asking Siri to turn on the lights, close the 
shades, or activat
e a theme. We can't wait to deliver all of these powerful 
innovations in the months to come. And we might even have some others to 
share with you later in the year.
 
Now for more details on the June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over 
to 
Luca.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter 
was $45.4 billion, up 7% over last year, an acceleration to the growth rate 
we reported during the first half of our fiscal year. We achieved these resu
lts 
despite a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange on a year
-
over
-
year basis, as currency movements, especially in Europe and China, 
affected our reported results.
 
Our performance was very strong across the board with growth in all our 
pro
duct categories and almost every market around the world. We achieved 
double
-
digit revenue growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., 
Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Korea, and emerging markets 
outside of Greater China grew 19% over a yea
r ago. Gross margin was 
38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.7% 
of revenue and net income was $8.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were 
$1.67, up 17% over last year, and cash flow from operations was $8.4 
billion.
 
Durin
g the quarter we sold 41 million iPhones and reduced iPhone channel 
inventory by 3.3 million units, leaving us with our lowest level of channel 
inventory in 2.5 years and well within our five
-
week to seven
-
week target 
inventory range. iPhone sales were up 
year
-
over
-
year in most markets we 
track, with many markets in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East 
growing unit sales by more than 25%. We are very pleased with these 
iPhone results, especially considering the tough comparison to the June 
quarter last 
year when we launched iPhone SE.
 
iPhone ASP was $606, up from $595 a year ago, thanks to strong demand 
for iPhone 7 Plus, which represented a higher percentage of the iPhone mix 
compared to the Plus model a year ago. The impact of the stronger mix on 
ASP w
as partially offset by negative foreign exchange year over year and the 
reduction in channel inventory, which took place entirely at the high end of 
the portfolio.
 
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both 
consumers and busin
ess uses. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 
Research on consumers indicates a 95% customer satisfaction rating for 
iPhone 7 and 99% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among consumers planning to buy a 
smartphone, purchase intention for iPhone was nearly three times th
e rate 
of our closest competitor. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iOS 
customer satisfaction was 94%. And of those planning to purchase 
smartphones in the September quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone.
 
Turning to Services, we set an all
-
time quarterl
y record of $7.3 billion, up 
22% year over year. The App Store was a major driver of this performance. 
And according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be by a wide 
margin the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating nearly 
twice
 
the revenue of Google Play. Revenue from our Apple Music streaming 
service and from iCloud storage also grew very strongly. And across all of 
our Services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 185 
million, an increase of almost 20 milli
on in the last 90 days alone.
 
The reach, usage, and functionality of Apple Pay continue to grow. We 
launched Apple Pay in Italy in May. And the UAE, Denmark, Finland, and 
Sweden are scheduled to go live before the end of this calendar year. Apple 
Pay is by
 
far the number one NFC payment service on mobile devices, with 
nearly 90% of all transactions globally. Momentum is strongest in 
international markets, where the infrastructure for mobile payments has 
developed faster than in the U.S. In fact, three out o
f four Apple Pay 
transactions happen outside the U.S. And with the launch of iOS 11 this fall, 
our users in the U.S. will be able to make and receive person
-
to
-
person 
payments quickly, easily, and securely.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Thanks to g
reat performance from the 
new MacBook Pro, we generated 7% revenue growth over last year and 
gained share in the global PC market based on the latest data from IDC. 
Customer satisfaction for Mac is very strong at 97% in the most recent 
survey from 451 Rese
arch, and our active installed base of Mac has grown 
double digits over a year ago. We ended the quarter within our four to five
-
week target range for Mac channel inventory, and we have a great lineup of 
Macs for our customers heading into the busy back
-
to
-
school season.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold 11.4 million units, up 15% over last year. We were 
happy to see iPad growth in each of our geographic segments, with strong 
double
-
digit increases in key markets such as the U.S., Japan, Germany, 
France, and Greater
 
China. We exited the quarter within our five to seven
-
week target range for iPad channel inventory.
 
NPD indicates that iPad had 55% share of the U.S. tablet market in the 
month of June, including 8 of the 10 best
-
selling tablets. That's up from 46% 
share 
a year ago. And among tablets priced over $200, iPad's share was 
89%. In addition, the most recent survey from 451 Research measured 
business and consumer satisfaction rates ranging from 95% to 99% across 
iPad models. And among those planning to buy tablet
s, purchase intent for 
iPad was over 70%.
 
Our enterprise business continues to expand, and our customers are 
transforming the way work gets done with iOS and iPad. Walmart will be 
deploying more than 19,000 iPads for employee training across 50 states, 
wit
h projections of over 225,000 associates trained on iPad by the end of the 
year. Initial response from businesses to iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro has 
been amazing. And companies including Bank of America, Medtronic, and 
Panera tell us that they will be roll
ing out the 10.5
-
inch iPad Pro throughout 
key areas of their organizations.
 
We're also seeing real traction with our enterprise partners. Just last month, 
we unveiled the next set of technology announcements in our partnership 
with Cisco. This new wave add
s a whole new category of security features 
designed to help enterprises and employees defend against growing cyber 
threats. We believe this investment in our joint security solutions for iOS will 
make cyber insurance even more attainable for businesses.
 
S
AP is making great strides since launching the SAP cloud platform SDK for 
iOS in March, with a pipeline of hundreds of global opportunities. SAP has 
also released SuccessFactors Mobile, its first native iOS app for human 
resources, which will support 47 mi
llion iPhone and iPad users worldwide 
across multiple industries.
 
And our partnership with Deloitte has recently expanded to several more 
European countries. We're helping clients transform their businesses with 
iOS. We jointly developed programs such as t
he Connected Store, a pop
-
up 
version of a retail environment, demonstrating iOS tools for sales and 
demand generation, as well as tailored apps for safe associates, store 
management, and customers.
 
We also had a tremendous quarter for iPad in education, up
 
32% year over 
year. Following the launch of our new iPad in March, an update to our 
popular Classroom app, and continued enhancements to iOS that make 
managing iPads in the classroom even easier. The St. Paul Public School 
District in Minnesota is renewin
g its One to One program by deploying over 
40,000 iPads across every student and teacher in the district. iPad was 
chosen because of its power and durability, ease of use, multimedia and 
accessibility features, and the extensive catalog of iOS apps designe
d 
specifically for education.
 
The Shawnee Mission School District outside Kansas City recently purchased 
19,000 iPads, extending its One to One program started in 2014 thanks to 
iPad's intuitive interface, superior reliability, and expansive ecosystem of i
OS 
tools for education.
 
It was a very busy quarter for our retail and online stores, which collectively 
welcomed over 300 million visitors. In addition to our spectacular new store 
at the Dubai Mall, we opened our first stores in Singapore and in Taiwan 
du
ring the quarter, expanding our total store footprint to 497 stores. In May, 
we kicked off Today at Apple, with new in
-
store programming from music to 
photography to art and coding. And our stores collectively hosted 87,000 
sessions during the quarter. As 
Tim mentioned last quarter, we have entered 
a new chapter in retail with unique and rewarding experiences for our 
customers and some stunning new stores coming in the near future.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $261.5 
billi
on in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $4.7 
billion. $246 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United 
States. We retired $3.5 billion of debt and issued the equivalent of $10.8 
billion in new euro and U.S. dollar
-
denominated debt during the quarter, 
including our second green bond, bringing us to $96.4 billion in term debt 
and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding.
 
We also returned $11.7 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.4 
billion in divide
nds and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 
30.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We launched a 
new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 
15.6 million shares, and we retired 3.4 milli
on shares upon the completion of 
our 10th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed $222.9 billion of 
our $300 billion capital return program, including $158.5 billion in share 
repurchases.
 
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to revie
w our 
outlook, which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$49 billion and $52 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% 
and 38%. We expect OpEx to b
e between $6.7 billion and $6.8 billion. We 
expect OI&E to be about $500 million. And we expect the tax rate to be 
about 25.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash 
dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on August 17, 2017 
t
o shareholders of record as of August 14, 2017.
 
With that, I would like to open the call to questions.

and one follow

up. Rebecca, may we have the first
 
question, please?

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
And that question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, first question for you, gross margin 
guidance is strong, but it did tick down from your June quarter guidance, 
and you also narrowed the range to 50 basis points. I wonder if you can just 
address. What is the driver of the sequential downtick, and what gives you 
confidence that you have more 
visibility than you did three months ago?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Katy, sequentially from 38.5% that we just reported, typically we have 
product transition costs during the September quarter. That's the primary 
driver. This happens fairly regularly for 
us. We also have a more difficult 
memory pricing environment this year than a year ago. And we think that 
we're going to be able to partially offset this with the positive leverage. As 
you've seen, we guided up sequentially in revenue. So those are the maj
or 
puts and takes.
 
In terms of the range that we use for gross margins, we have a fairly good 
understanding on where we are with our hedging program, and that allows 
us to mitigate some of the volatility there. So we felt we could guide to a 
slightly narro
wer range, which we've done occasionally in the past.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thank you, and maybe a question for both Tim and Luca. As you outlined on 
this call and at the Developer Conference in June, there is an unprecedented 
num
ber of products that either ramped volume or launched in the back half 
of this year. So appreciating you only formally guide a quarter out, I wonder 
if there's any qualitative commentary you can provide to help us think about 
the back half of this calendar
 
year and how all those new products that come 
into the model could impact either revenue seasonality versus past years or 
could impact just the costs associated with ramping that many products all 
at once. Thanks.
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
Katy, a
s Luca mentioned, we did assume some transitional costs in our 
guidance for the quarter, as is typically the case. And we're looking very 
much forward to the product rollouts.
 
Nancy Paxton

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, ple
ase?
 
Operator
 
We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.

Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, could you talk a bit about 
what you're seeing in China? I think obviously, there continues to be strong 
dema
nd for smartphones. But perhaps mix shift, I think you brought back 
the iPhone 6 this quarter to be a bit more price aggressive. And then can 
you just talk a bit about how you see that market developing with the 
growth of WeChat and some of the other devel
opments that are happening 
there? Thank you.

Yeah. Thanks, Shannon. We were very encouraged by the results this 
quarter. We improved as we thought we would from the previous quarters a 
little more than I thought we would. 
If you look underneath the numbers, 
mainland China was actually flat year
-
over
-
year during Q3. And in constant 
currency terms, we were actually up 6% in mainland China. And so we're 
very encouraged about that. iPad grew dramatically more than the market. 
T
he Mac grew much more than the market. iPhone was relatively flat year
-
on
-
year, similar as the market was. And so we see all of those as very 
encouraging signs. On top of that, Services grew extremely strongly during 
the quarter.
 
Hong Kong continued to dra
g down the total Greater China segment. But on 
a sequential basis, we're probably at the trough of that, which is nice. With 
the peg to the dollar there from a currency point of view and tourism being 
what it is, I don't really know when that market will c
ome back. But what we 
see on the mainland is definitely much more encouraging. It's interesting to 
note that upgraders both for the quarter and actually for the full fiscal year 
to
-
date was our highest ever, and so that we felt very good about.
 
In terms of
 
WeChat, the way that I look at this is because our share 

 
because iOS share is not nearly a majority of the market in China, the fact 
that a lot of people use that, it makes the switching opportunity even 
greater. And I think that's more the case than th
e risk that a lot of folks 
have pointed out. And so I see Tencent as one of our biggest and best 
developers. They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in 
their apps and we're looking forward to working with them even more to 
build even
 
greater experiences for our mutual users in China.

Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about the composition of the 
installed base of iPhones at this point, as obviously we're getting close to a 
refresh? Jus
t you brought in the iPhone SE. You've obviously had strength at 
the high end. I'm just trying to think about what percent do you think have 
upgraded in the prior generation, any color you can give us on that?

From an abso
lute quantity point of view, the upgrades for this fiscal year are 
the highest that we've seen. And so we feel good about that. However, if 
you look at it from an upgrade rate point of view instead of the absolute 
number, the rate is similar to what we saw
 
with the previous iPhones, except 
for iPhone 6, which as we called out in the past had an abnormally high 
upgrade rate. We do think that based on the amount of rumors and the 
volume of them that there is some pause in our current numbers. And so 
where tha
t affects us in the short
-
term, even though we had great results, it 
probably bodes well later on.

Thank you. I wonder if you wanted to make any comments about switching 
this quarter.
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Sure. Switching outside of China was up year
-
on
-
year, and so we're happy 
with that. We continue to see people moving over to iOS 
and it helped with 
us making the results that Luca announced earlier, including the channel 
inventory reduction.

Okay, and then a government question. First of all, the President suggested 
that you may build three big
 
beautiful plants. I wonder if you can comment 
on if that's a possibility either directly or indirectly. And then in China, I 
think, we all understand that you have to work within the regulations, but 
maybe you could comment a bit on how you feel your work
ing relationship is 
with the government and if there is certain lines that you can't cross.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Sure. Starting with the U.S., let me just take this question from what are we 
doing to increase jobs, which I think is probably wh
ere it's rooted. We've 
created 2 million jobs in the U.S., and we're incredibly proud of that. We do 
view that we have a responsibility in the U.S. to increase economic activity, 
including increasing jobs, because Apple could have only been created here. 
A
nd so as we look at that 2 million, there are three main categories of that, 
and we have actions going on in each of them to further build on that 
momentum.
 
The first category is app development. About three
-
quarters of the 2 million 
are app developers. An
d we're doing an enormous amount of things to 
deliver curriculum to both K
-
12 with Swift Playgrounds in the K
-
to
-
6 area, 
other curriculum as you proceed beyond grade 6 under the Everyone Can 
Code area. And just a couple months ago, we announced a new curri
culum 
that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior 
colleges, technical colleges, for kids that did not have coding in their 
elementary and high school years. And so we're excited about that because 
we think it could increase the diver
sity of the developer community and the 
quantity. And I think this area in general and all the things we do for the 
developer community will be the largest contribution that Apple can make 
because this is the fastest growing job segment in the country, and
 
I think 
will be for quite some time.
 
If you look at the second area, we have purchased 

 
or we purchased last 
year about $50 billion worth of goods and services from U.S.
-
based 
suppliers. Some significant portion of those are manufacturing
-
related, and 
so
 
we've asked ourselves what can we do to increase this. And you may 
have seen that at the beginning of the quarter, sometime in April I believe, 
we announced a fund, an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, that we're initially 
placing $1 billion in. And we've alre
ady deployed $200 million of that. And 
the first recipient is Corning in Kentucky, and they'll be using that money to 
expand the plant to make very innovative glass. And we purchase that glass 
and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads.
 
We think there's more of these that we can do. I think there are probably 
several plants that can benefit from having some investment to grow or 
expand or even maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time, so we're 
very excited about that.
 
And then the
 
third area is we have about two
-
thirds or so of our total 
employee base is in the U.S. despite only a third of our revenues being here, 
and we'll have some things that we'll say about that later in the year. And so 
that's what we're doing from a job growt
h point of view, and we're very, 
very proud of that.
 
Now turning to China, let me comment on what I assumed is at the root of 
your question about this VPN issue. Let me just address that head on. The 
central government in China back in 2015 started tighten
ing the regulations 
associated with VPN apps, and we have a number of those on our store. 
Essentially, as a requirement for someone to operate a VPN, they have to 
have a license from the government there. Earlier this year, they began a 
renewed effort to e
nforce that policy, and we were required by the 
government to remove some of the VPN apps from the App Store that don't 
meet these new regulations. We understand that those same requirements 
are on other app stores, and as we checked through that, that is 
the case.
 
Today there are actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, 
including hundreds by developers that are outside China, and so there 
continues to be VPN apps available. We would obviously rather not remove 
the apps, but like we do in other
 
countries, we follow the law wherever we 
do business. And we strongly believe that participating in markets and 
bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in 
other countries as well. And so we believe in engaging with go
vernments 
even when we disagree.
 
And in this particular case, now back to commenting on this one, we're 
hopeful that over time the restrictions that we're seeing are loosened 
because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate, 
and I 
know that that is a major focus there. And so that's what we're seeing 
from that point of view.
 
Some folks have tried to link it to the U.S. situation last year, and they're 
very different. In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us, 
which w
as very clear. In the case of China, the law is also very clear there. 
And like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we'd have to abide by 
them in both cases, that doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view 
in the appropriate way. We always d
o that. And so hopefully that's a little bit 
probably more than you wanted to know, but I wanted to tell you.

Thank you, a question for Tim maybe on the iPhone install base. At various 
points in the past y
ou've told us the rate at which that was growing. At the 
end of the first half, what is that up year on year? At what rate is it growing? 
Can you give us some sense of that?
 
And on upgrade rates over the longer term, there are lots of moving parts, 
and I g
et that there's I guess geographic mix shift of your base. There's 
many new phones that you may or may not bring out. There's how carriers 
promote your products. But do you think this upgrade rate is sustainable? 
Do you think it gets faster all the time? H
ow should we think about the 
major drivers that you want to see for it? Many thanks.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I think the upgrade rate is a function of many, many different things, from 
the size of the installed base, the age of the installed base
, the product that 
is new at the time, the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that are in 
various markets around the world. And so I think there are many, many 
factors in that. It's not a simple thing that you can apply a set formula to or 
one variab
le or a couple of variable formula in my opinion. But I think in 
general, because our installed base was up strong double digit once again, 
there's a lot of factors that are very positive for us. And between the 
upgraders and the switchers that we see, and
 
the first
-
time buyer category 
is still out there too in several countries, including some that you may not 
think there is, there's still a sizable base in some. Between those three 
areas, I think we have a lot of opportunity.

Yes, thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. Luca, typically 
in the fiscal Q4, Apple builds considerable iPhone channel inventory, like 2 
million or 3 million units. You're s
tarting from a very low point at the end of 
fiscal Q3, as you mentioned on the call, with the drawdown. As we think 
about what's embedded in your guidance for fiscal Q4 for channel inventory 
for iPhone, should we be expecting a normal seasonal build, or is
 
it likely to 
be significantly higher given the very low starting point?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
As you know, Toni, we do not guide on channel inventory. We've never done 
that. We are providing a fairly wide range from a revenue standpoint, so 
obviously
 
that also has an impact on potential channel inventory levels.
 
One thing that I would tell you is that we feel very good about the 
performance of the business right now. We think that our Services business 
will continue to grow well. We've got a lot of mo
mentum on iPad and Mac 
because we refreshed the lineups of those products. Watch and AirPods are 
doing incredibly well. We're getting a lot of positive customer feedback. And 
I think in general, even the performance in China, Tim has mentioned it. We 
think
 
that the performance will continue to improve. So those are the drivers 
of our guidance range for the quarter.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay, thanks. Tim, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about 
two things 
that you mentioned in public before. One is television, which you 
have described as an area of intense interest, but I don't even think there 
was an update on Apple TV on this call. So perhaps you can talk to us about 
how you're thinking about content. I k
now you're doing some original 
content creation, and how that area is evolving in your thinking.
 
And then recently you talked about how Apple is focusing on autonomous 
systems for automobiles. And there has been press reports that Apple has 
been testing au
tonomous vehicles for potentially up to a year. I was 
wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Apple's interest in 
autonomous vehicles and whether self
-
driving is really likely to be Apple's 
principal focus in the near to medium
-
term.
 
Timothy Do
nald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
On the first part of your question about original content, we have done some 
original content. It's focused on Apple Music. Currently, we have some more 
that's launching in a week or so that will be made available on Apple Music. 
Th
e objective of this is really twofold. One is for our own learning, given that 
we're new in the video space in terms of creation. And two is to give the 
Apple Music subscriber some exclusive content and hopefully grow our 
subscriber base. And we've recentl
y hired two great folks with lots of 
experience in creating content like Breaking Bad and The Crown and some 
really top
-
notch content. And so we'll see how this area goes, but it is still an 
area of great interest.
 
In terms of autonomous systems, what we'v
e said is that we are very 
focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view. We 
do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this. From 
our point of view, autonomy is the mother of all AI projects. And the 
autonomous s
ystems can be used in a variety of ways and a vehicle is only 
one. But there are many different areas of it and I don't want to go any 
further with that. But thank you for the question.

Good afternoon. I just have one question for Tim. This may be a hard 
question to answer in a condensed way, but how would you describe what 
you ex
pect the most near
-
term applications will be for developers to target 
using ARKit? Will it be consumer iPhone and iPad applications, enterprise 
applications, or I guess some combination of the two? And basically, how 
does this come to market in the most si
gnificant way in the next few 
quarters as Apple becomes the largest global platform for AR as you've 
talked about? Thanks.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Mike, that is a great question. And I could not be more excited about AR and 
what we're seeing with
 
ARKit in the early going. And to answer your 
question about what category it starts in, just take a look at what's already 
on the web in terms of what people are doing and it is all over the place. 
From entertainment to gaming, I've seen what I would call
 
more small 
business solutions. I've seen consumer solutions. I've seen enterprise 
solutions. I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things 
that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it.
 
So I think that customers are going to 
see it in a variety of ways. Enterprise 
takes a little longer sometimes to get going. But I can already tell you 
there's lots of excitement in there. And I think we'll start to see some 
applications there as well. And it feels great to get this thing going
 
at a level 
that can get all of the developers behind it, so I couldn't be more excited 
about it.

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess to start off with, on your 
Services segment, revenues actually I think accelerated by 400 basis points 
to worse than what you guys had in the first half of
 
this year. Could you just 
help us understand what's driving this? Is there a way to think about ARPU 
in a traditional manner within that Services business versus the installed 
base growing?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Amit, Luca. Our Services business is v
ery broad. We've got multiple 
categories in the Services business, so it's difficult to talk about ARPU in 
general. It doesn't make a lot of sense. The reason for the acceleration also 
here is multiple factors. One that is very, very important for us is th
e fact 
that the App Store, which is the largest of our Services categories, is seeing 
an increasingly larger amount of paying accounts. On a year
-
over
-
year 
basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on 
the App Store is growing v
ery, very well.
 
It is happening for a variety of reasons. One of them, for example, is the 
fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store. 
Outside the United States, in many markets, not every form of payment is 
accepted. We are ma
king it easier all the time. We launched on Alipay, for 
example, in China during the December quarter. That has obviously helped a 
lot with the growth in the number of paid accounts. And we continue to bring 
more and more forms of payment in the App Store 
around the world. That's 
a big reason for that.
 
The other reason why the number of paying accounts is growing is the fact 
that the quality and the quantity of content continues to improve. And so 
there's many more ways of experiencing games and entertainme
nt and 
other apps on the store. We have other businesses like the Apple Music 
streaming service, which is growing very fast because we just started it a 
couple of years ago, so we are getting a lot of new subscribers there. Our 
iCloud storage business cont
inues to grow very, very fast. So it's multiple 
services. The number of people transacting on our stores continues to grow.
 
In terms of ARPU, maybe I can make a comment on ARPU specifically 
related to the App Store. What we're seeing and we've seen over a 
long 
period of time as we keep track of these cohorts of customers, we see that 
as customers get on the App Store and start spending on it, we see the 
spending profile is very similar across generations of customers. People tend 
to spend more over time. Ob
viously, you have different spending profiles in 
different geographies around the world, but in general you see that trend 
across the board.

Got it, that's really helpful. And if I could just follow up, on the iPhon
e side, 
there's been a large amount of discussion in blogs and among your 
component suppliers that the timing this time may be somewhat different 
and delayed versus past. Your guide almost seems you're more excited 
about this iPhone launch versus historica
lly because the sequential growth is 
better. So I guess beyond the fact we probably shouldn't read every blog 
and believe every blog, what do you think is different with this product 
launch or product availability through the cycle versus what you've seen 
historically?

Brian J. White

Drexel Hamilton LLC
 
Yes. Tim, growth in the smartphone market is now crawling along at about a 
low single digit percentage. I know iPhone grew about 2% year over
 
year 
this quarter, and it looks like you had about a mid
-
teens market share in 
units in 2016. So as we look forward maybe three to four years, do you 
think Apple can expand its unit market share? And if so, what will be the 
drivers be?
 
And my second quest
ion is just about India, general thoughts about India in 
the quarter. Thank you.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
The answer to your first question is yes. I do think that we can grow both in 
units and market share. We don't predict those things, but yes,
 
if you ask 
me what I think, that's what I think.
 
And so what are the drivers? The installed base is growing. It's still growing 
very strongly. That will generate more upgrades over time. I feel good about 
our ability to convince people to switch. And wher
e the developed markets 
the first
-
time buyer rates are down other than places like Japan perhaps, the 
emerging markets, we haven't even gotten started yet, really. From a 
revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there. Emerging markets 
ex
-
China wer
e up 18% year on year. It was a record for us, so we see a lot 
of opportunity in these markets.
 
We are investing in India. As you mentioned in your second point, we've 
already launched an app accelerator center. That's on top of working with 
the channel an
d looking at expanding our go
-
to
-
market in general. And we 
began to produce the iPhone SE there during the quarter, and we're really 
happy with how that's going. And so we're bringing all of our energies to 
bear there. I see a lot of similarities to where 
China was several years ago. 
And so I'm very, very bullish and very, very optimistic about India.

Apple, Inc.
 
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.
 
Today we are reporting strong March quarter results, wit
h accelerating 
revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great 
about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion, near the high end of our 
guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year, with growth 
accelerating from our D
ecember quarter performance. That's despite a $1 
billion year
-
over
-
year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March 
quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last 
year.
 
iPhone sales were line in line with our expectat
ions, and we're thrilled to see 
the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large 
display and dual
-
camera system. Our active installed base of iPhones grew 
by double digits year over year. And based on the latest data from IDC, we 
gain
ed market share in nearly every country we track.
 
Late in the quarter, we released the stunning (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition 
versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our 
partnership with RED. This relationship has given our cust
omers an 
unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world a 
step closer to an AIDS
-
free generation. We've seen wonderful customer 
response to these eye
-
popping new iPhones.
 
For the second quarter in a row, our Services revenue topped 
$7 billion, and 
it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very 
happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple 
ecosystem across all of our services.
 
App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% yea
r over year 
to an all
-
time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for 
sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their 
success.
 
We also saw double
-
digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and 
iCloud 
storage and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid 
subscriptions for our own services and the third
-
party content we offer on 
our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million.
 
Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the lau
nch of Taiwan 
and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets with 
more than 20 million contactless
-
ready locations, including more than 4.5 
million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone.
 
We're seeing strong growing usage as
 
points of acceptance expand, with 
transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for 
example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year, while 
monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, 
where Apple Pa
y launched last October, more than 0.5 million transit users 
are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month. And we're 
always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use 
Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift ca
rd via iMessage with 
just a touch.
 
We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in Messages. In 
fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were 
sending 380,000 Messages per second, more than double the previous year. 
A few we
eks ago, we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great 
example of how we're continually making our products even more engaging, 
and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, 
photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad i
nto great
-
looking expressive 
videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share 
your clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media.
 
We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new 
March qua
rter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for 
our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in 
revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its 
future, and we are very excited about the inno
vation we can bring to the 
platform.
 
We also updated our most popular sized iPad with a brighter Retina display 
and best
-
in
-
class performance at its most affordable price ever, and 
customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of 
our expectations, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter 
in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad 
remains the world's most popular tablet, and it's the primary computing 
device for millions of customers 
across the globe.
 
Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales 
nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best
-
selling and most 
loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our 
customers about its impact 
on their fitness and health.
 
We're also seeing great response to AirPods, with a 98% customer 
satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategy survey. Demand for 
AirPods significantly exceeds supply, and growth in Beats products has also 
been very s
trong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and 
Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four 
quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company.
 
In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double
-
digit revenue 
growth
 
from both Mac and Services during the March quarter. We also had 
great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store 
revenue up 27% over last year and comp store revenue up 7%. These 
results contributed to our improving performance in
 
Greater China. Through 
the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year
-
over
-
year comparisons 
improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First half 
revenue was down 13% year over year, about a third of which was 
attributable to FX. T
hat's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second 
half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our 
expectations, and similar to the year
-
over
-
year performance we experienced 
in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusias
tic about our 
opportunity in China.
 
We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong 
double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire 
ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remark
able 
country with its very large, young, and tech
-
savvy population, fast
-
growing 
economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure.
 
Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for 
customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the 
opening of our 
newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations 
worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with 
employees who collectively speak 45 languages, and are already welcoming 
customers from around
 
the world.
 
As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to 
our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're 
increasing the program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, 
and we're ext
ending the timeframe through March of 2019. We're adding to 
our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth 
time in less than five years.
 
We're very excited about our upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference 
taking place in San
 
Jose next month. The conference is significantly 
oversubscribed, and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look 
forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all 
four of our software platforms 

 
iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS 

 
that 
enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of 
customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, 
health, and more.
 
I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our 10th annual 
Environmental Responsibi
lity Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 
2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from 
renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 
585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, in
cluding 
all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done, but we're 
committed to leaving the world better than we found it.
 
Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate 
headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for 
innovation. The main building 
on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an 
environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly 
talented teams.
 
We have many more ongoing investments in the United States econo
my, 
since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America. 
Through our innovative products and the success of our business, we're 
incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we 
expect to create even more. Last
 
fiscal year, we spent more than $50 billion 
in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners, and 
we continue to invest confidently in our future.
 
Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call 
over to L
uca.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.
 
Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double
-
digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, 
Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Our growth r
ates were even higher, over 20% in 
many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central 
and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand.
 
Gross margin was 38.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. That's a 
sequential increase from 3
8.5% in the December quarter, which is 
particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential 
foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on 
certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and net 
income w
as $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase 
of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 
billion.
 
For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones, 
and we reduced iPhone channel
 
inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, 
compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone 
performance was slightly better than last year on a sell
-
through basis.
 
We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segment
s and 
experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, 
and our Rest of Asia
-
Pacific segment, all areas of the world where iPhone 
sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, 
thanks to a strong mix of i
Phone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign 
exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven
-
week 
target channel inventory range.
 
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with 
consumers but also with
 
business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 
451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating 
among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate 
smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95%. And of those
 
planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% plan to 
purchase iPhone.
 
Turning to Services, we generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% 
year over year and our best results ever for a 13
-
week quarter. We're very 
happy with the strong
 
level of growth, especially given the tough compare to 
last year, as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within 
the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal 
quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goa
l is to double the size of 
our Services business by 2020.
 
The App Store established a new all
-
time revenue record and grew 40% year 
over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying 
account as well as the number of paying accounts across o
ur content stores 
during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying 
accounts was the largest that we've ever experienced. And according to App 
Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination 
for cust
omer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during 
the March quarter.
 
Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over year and 
set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last 
year, compared to zer
o growth in the PC market according to IDC's latest 
forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall 
portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. We 
ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five
-
week t
arget range for 
Mac channel inventory.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units, which was ahead of our 
expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We are very 
pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenu
e 
growth worldwide for our 9.7
-
inch and larger iPads over the last four 
quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to 
the end of the quarter, and we exited just below our five to seven
-
week 
target range.
 
iPad remains very succ
essful in the segments of the tablet market where we 
compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the 
U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research 
measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that range fr
om 95% for the 
9.7
-
inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9
-
inch version. Among U.S. consumers 
planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention 
for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a 
purchase intent 
of 68% for the June quarter.
 
All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive more buying 
transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue 
record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for 
the rema
inder of the year.
 
Recently, Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard 
smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity 
to enjoy the best
-
in
-
class mobile experience that iPhone offers. And Capital 
One has reimagined the c
ustomer banking experience by empowering their 
associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications 
now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads.
 
We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners, who are 
helping us delive
r long
-
lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus 
competing platforms. The Deloitte partnership is off to a great start, with 
more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different 
industries.
 
SAP released the SAP Cloud Platfor
m SDK for iOS at the end of March, and 
over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop 
powerful iOS
-
native apps for the enterprise.
 
The partnership with Cisco enables optimized performance of iOS devices 
over their networks and is ge
nerating a large and growing pipeline of sales 
opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial 
services.
 
And our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and 
innovation, with IBM Mobile First for iOS apps now
 
in more than 3,300 client 
engagements. And with its Mobile at Scale offering, IBM recently closed an 
agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at Santander Bank to drive digital 
transformation.
 
Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong
 
revenue 
growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to 
our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added four 
new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in 
Dubai last week, we're n
ow at 495 stores in 18 countries.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $256.8 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 
billion. $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the 
U
nited States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us 
to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper 
outstanding.
 
We returned over $10 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 
billion in dividends and equ
ivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases 
of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also 
launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 
17.5 million shares. And we retired 6.3 million shares up
on the completion of 
our ninth accelerated share repurchase program in February. All these 
activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million 
shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 
billion capital
 
return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases.
 
As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which 
we are extending by four quarters through March of 2019, and increasing in 
size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, g
iven our strong confidence in 
Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we are allocating the 
majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has 
increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from 
the cur
rent $175 billion level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net 
share settle vesting employees' restricted stock units.
 
In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five 
years. As we know, this is very important to many of 
our investors who 
value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.57 to $0.63 per 
share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend, which 
the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of 
record as of May 
15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend 
payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, 
and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In 
total, with this updated program, during the next eight 
quarters we expect 
to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our 
market cap at the current stock price.
 
We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current U.S. 
cash, future U.S. cash generation and borrowing f
rom both domestic and 
international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation 
regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, investment 
opportunities, and our financial outlook. We'll also continue to solicit input on 
our progr
am from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us 
to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our 
program.
 
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forwar
d
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 
billion and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 
38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion. We
 
expect OI&E to be about $450 million, and we expect the tax rate to be 
about 25.5%.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross
 
margins. How were 
you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally 
for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And 
maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments 
to Qualcomm is
 
benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also 
whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross 
margins by more in the back half of this calendar year.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let
 
me take them one by one. Let me 
start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy 
with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in 
spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the 
D
ecember quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on 
a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. 
And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the 
memory side, particularly on N
AND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually 
do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other 
commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through 
the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross m
argin 
for Services. So that answers the question around Q2.
 
As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level 
of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June 
quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from th
e sequential loss of 
leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June 
quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset 
partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix 
shift to
wards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be 
there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June 
quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being.
 
On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that w
e are accruing. 
We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. 
So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March 
quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either.

Okay, thank you. And just a follow
-
up for Tim, as you noted in your 
remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was 
a product that was pretty severely supply
-
constrained in the December 
quarter. An
d I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go 
forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of 
announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might 
work with the supply chain differently around
 
ramping some of these 
components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on.
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the 
iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was 

 
wound up
 
that demand was 
much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us 
a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring 
iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter.
 
What did we lea
rn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn 
something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll 
apply everything we learn to the next time.

We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
 
Shannon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China 
and give us some more colo
r, especially as you're going through the year? 
And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just 
are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all 
iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a f
ollow
-
up.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that 
combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than 
what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look
 
at what 
was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models 
in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 
Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth 
was up 20% in China, an
d we had extremely strong Services growth during 
the quarter in China.
 
As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall 
and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had 
seen in the previous quarter. And 
traffic 

 
which for us is incredibly 
important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell 

 
traffic was 
up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in 
the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things
 
that went in 
our direction, so to speak.
 
On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant 
headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which 
has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market 
continues to slump. Also, 
where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the 
previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and 
minus side.
 
We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought 
it would 
be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that 
we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but 
improve 

 
but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's 
an enormous opportun
ity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is 
pretty large there.

Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but 
thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have
 
I 
think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So 
I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the 
administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of 
return, how do you generally think
 
about what you need to run the business 
from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a 
strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come 
through?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Shannon, you know how we run our capital 
return program. We've been 
pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, 
the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to 
our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and
 
the 
expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same 
direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will 
never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we 
generate cash beyond the needs th
at we have. And given the current capital 
structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of 
the free cash flow to investors.
 
It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The 
program that we're announcing 
today reflects the current tax legislation in 
this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. 
Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going 
back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could 
comment on the unique nu
mber of users there. And I think you had made a 
comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user 
was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about 
any more color around that average revenue per user, it woul
d be 
interesting to us. And then I have one follow
-
up to that. Thanks.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of 
course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out 
the
re. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than 
one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of 
subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very 
good for us to see the bread
th of subscriptions that we offer and that 
customers are interested in. It's a large number.
 
And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we 
talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 
15 million subscript
ions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it 
really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content 
stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days.
 
As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our con
tent stores, 
particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently 
two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And 
I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this 
last 90 day
s is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of 
people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is 
obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start 
paying and transacting on our stores, and tha
t number is growing very, very 
strongly, strong double digits.
 
What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, 
we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across 
cohorts of customers, that as people come i
nto the ecosystem and start 
paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar 
around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend 
more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more 
over
 
time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the 
stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store 
on a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
Rod Hall

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow
-
up for T
im. Tim, I wanted to 
just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit 
contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think 
seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in 
pricing certa
in key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to 
penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little 
bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit 
contribution from that Services business, how you
 
intend to apply it to the 
rest of the business. Thank you.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we 
think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on 
the har
dware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we 
think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to 
subsidize the other or vice
-
versa.

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in 
wearables? The 
watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very 
good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in 
that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do 
you see wearables: A
), expanding over time into a broader product line; and 
B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product 
category for us since before we 
launched it. We took our time to get it right, 
and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really 
proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in 
six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, part
icularly in a 
non
-
holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it.
 
As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues 
with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full 
quarter of shipments for AirPods.
 
It's still very much in the ramping mode, 
and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the 
Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look 
on the trailing 12 months 

 
so this is not a forecast 

 
that busine
ss was well 
into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that 
far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, 
four months, and so we feel really great about it.
 
Where does it go? I wouldn't want t
o comment on that, but we do have a 
really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and 
so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering 
point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies a
nd so forth. 
And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But 
we're very committed to it and believe that 

 
it's already a big business and 
believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question.

Thank you. And then there was a 

 
you mentioned the 451 Research survey. 
They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine

in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. 
And the o
ther was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any 
comment on either of those and whether you're concerned?
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, 
what we are seeing, we'r
e seeing what we believe to be a pause in 
purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more 
frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, 
and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we a
re seeing that 
in full transparency.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can 
comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty 
payments to Qualcomm. An
d really specifically, I wonder what you believe is 
the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as 
withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on 
iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to 
understand 
your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And 
why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will 
arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history?
 
Timothy Donald Coo

Apple, Inc.
 
Anyone that has a standards
-
essential patent has a responsibility to offer it 
to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND 
stands for fair, reasonable, and non
-
discriminatory terms. That's both the 
price and the b
usiness terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to 
Apple. And so I don't believe that a 

 
I don't believe anyone is going to 
decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case 
law around that subject, but we shall see.
 
In ter
ms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when 
there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And 
so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, 
and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds t
here. And so at this point, we 
need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle 
between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts 
to do that. And so that is the thinking.
 
The reason that we're pursuing this is
 
that Qualcomm's trying to charge 
Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great 
work around standards
-
essential patents, but it's one small part of what an 
iPhone is. It's not 

 
it has nothing do with the display or the Touch 
ID or a 
gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's 
right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe 
we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what 
courts are for. 
And so we'll let it go with that.

Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone 
demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra 
week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make 
those adjustments. And that's a
ctually quite a bit lower than the normal 
seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I 
understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 
points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate
 
improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And 
then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones.
 
So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below 
sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 
attributable to a 
pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, 
perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be 
happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play 
here that, again, 
might be contributing to that pause and that sequential 
decline that I referenced? Thank you.

There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In 
this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2
 
million units. And so if 
you look on a year
-
over
-
year basis, which is primarily what we look at from 
a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, 
we grew sell
-
through on a year
-
over
-
year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other 
folks remember, was a 14
-
week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates 
last quarter to get at what the underlying sell
-
through growth was. And so I 
think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year
-
over
-
year performance is simila
r between the quarters.
 
In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders 
ever in any six
-
month period in the first half of this year, first half of this 
fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of 
switchers ou
tside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. 
And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in 
his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the 
demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing
 
incredibly fast around the world. 
And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that 
is useful for you.

Hi, thank you. I had a question for Luca first. Last year, you had a 4 million
-
unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just 
curious what you're expecting for this 
year just so we have an apples
-
to
-
apples comparison as we think about your guidance.

As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around 
channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right am
ount 
of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the 
last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in 
the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have.

Thank you, and then just for Tim. Tim, you've been excited about the India 
market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, 
manufacturing, and R&D presence there. So just curious as you look at that 
market and the rollout of 4G 
there, is it reasonable for us to assume that 
Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones 
there next year and then grow from there?

We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a
 
current quarter 
forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more 
information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of 
energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third 
largest smartphone mar
ket in the world today behind China and the United 
States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is 
going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge 
opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demogr
aphics of the 
country is why we're putting so much energy there.

Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth 
consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you 
mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if 
you look at geograp
hic information, India is really underpenetrated from an 
Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, 
a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 

 
18 months is 
going be a turning point, or is it more you need to
 
work with the 
government to have Apple
-
owned stores or production there? Or what's it 
really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a 
great opportunity?

We think it's a great opportunity t
oo, and so we're bringing all the things 
that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, 
and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil 
[Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quart
er, and 
so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are 
underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most 
people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot 
of energy in, just like we have in
 
other geos that eventually wound up 
producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it.
 
The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way 
toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. 
They're moving a
t a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the 
world once they were started, and it is truly impressive.

Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's 
been a busy and exciting qu
arter and I'm delighted to talk to you about the 
highlights. Today, we're proud to report record June quarter results with 
revenues of $49.6 billion and earnings of $10.7 billion. Our year
-
over
-
year 
growth rate in the fiscal third quarter accelerated over 
the first half of fiscal 
2015. Revenues were up 33%, our fastest growth rate in over three years, 
and earnings per share were up 45%. We achieved these incredibly strong 
results despite reducing channel inventories across our product lines by over 
1 millio
n units and despite the challenging FX environment.
 
Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance by $1.6 billion as we topped 
our internal expectations for sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. We 
had another stellar quarter for iPhone, establishing
 
a new June quarter 
record. iPhone unit sales grew 35%, which is almost three times the rate of 
growth of the smartphone market overall and we gained share in all of our 
geographic segments. iPhone revenue grew even more strongly, up 59%. 
The strong iPhone
 
results were broad
-
based in both developed and emerging 
markets and we experienced the highest switcher rate from Android that 
we've ever measured.
 
Most importantly, iPhone customer metrics are tremendous. ChangeWave's 
most recent survey of US customers f
ound that iPhone has the highest 
customer satisfaction rate of any smartphone brand by a wide margin, and 
that among iPhone owners planning to purchase a new phone, 86% plan to 
purchase another iPhone. That compares to 50% repurchase intent for the 
next hi
ghest brand measured.
 
We also had a tremendous record quarter for Mac, continuing to defy the 
industry trend with unit growth of 9% in a market that IDC estimates 
contracted by 12%. Growth was fueled by great response to our new 
MacBook and we're working h
ard to catch up with customer demand.
 
We generated over $5 billion in services revenue, setting a new all
-
time 
record. Within services, the App Store produced its best quarter ever with 
revenue growing 24%.
 
Our results from Greater China were outstanding w
ith revenue growth of 
112% and iPhone unit growth of 87%. This is particularly impressive given 
IDC's estimate of only 5% growth for the Greater China smartphone market. 
We also achieved our highest ever PC market share in the segment with Mac 
sales growin
g 33% over last year. And our ecosystem in China continues to 
grow at a very fast pace, with App Store revenue more than doubling in the 
quarter. Luca will go into more detail on our product and financial results in 
a moment.
 
A major highlight of the past 
quarter for all of us here at Apple was the 
launch of Apple Watch in April. As you know, we've been very excited to get 
this revolutionary product to customers. We started taking preorders in nine 
countries on April 10, and demand immediately exceeded supp
ly by a wide 
margin. To prioritize those first orders and to deliver the best experience for 
our customers, we delayed the availability of Apple Watch in our own retail 
stores until mid June. We made huge progress with the production ramp 
across the quarte
r and near the end of the quarter expanded into six 
additional countries. And in just the past few days, we've been able to catch 
up with demand, enabling us to expand Apple Watch availability to a total of 
19 countries currently with three more countries 
to be added at the end of 
this month.
 
The feedback from Apple Watch customers is incredibly positive and we've 
been very happy with customer satisfaction and usage statistics. Market 
research from Wristly measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for Apple
 
Watch and we hear from people every day about the impact it's having on 
their health, their daily routines, and how they communicate. Our own 
market research shows that 94% of Apple Watch owners wear and use it 
regularly, if not every day.
 
Messaging and a
ctivity features are among the most popular and social 
networking apps including Twitter, WeChat and LINE are seeing the most 
usage among third party apps. We believe that the possibilities for Apple 
Watch are enormous and that's been reinforced in just th
e first few weeks 
since it became available to customers.
 
For example, doctors and researchers at leading hospitals in the US and 
Europe are already putting Apple Watch to work in improving patients' lives. 
Nebraska Medicine, the latest hospital to adopt A
pple Watch, has rolled out 
new apps that facilitate communication between patients and doctors and 
provide quick access to important chart and dosage information.
 
Ochsner Health System of Louisiana is using Apple Watch with hypertension 
patients to gather 
important information like daily activity and blood 
pressure level, and leading cancer centers like London King's College 
Hospital are incorporating Apple Watch into trials for ongoing care and 
monitoring of cancer patients.
 
Great Apple Watch solutions go 
well beyond healthcare. Users are tracking 
their fitness, getting breaking news alerts, following their investments, 
connecting with friends, and living a healthier day. The user experience for 
Apple Pay and Siri is nothing short of incredible and customer
s are enjoying 
countless other features through the over 8,500 third
-
party apps available 
for Apple Watch.
 
This is just the beginning of what this new platform can deliver. With Apple 
watchOS 2, developers now have the ability to build richer and more 
powe
rful native apps for Apple Watch, taking advantage of the heart rate 
sensor, the Digital Crown, accelerometer and more, ushering in a whole new 
class of apps designed specifically for the wrist.
 
It's a rare and special privilege to launch a new platform wi
th such promise 
and potential, and I know I speak for everyone at Apple when I say that we 
can't wait to see what our developers and customers do with it.
 
We hosted a fantastic developers' conference in June with thousands of 
attendees from 70 countries co
ming together with Apple engineers to share 
in the excitement of our three operating systems, OS X, iOS, and watchOS. 
We've been working hard to make our products even more intelligent, more 
powerful and more meaningful in all aspects of our customers' liv
es, while 
adding new continuity features to make the experience across our devices 
more seamless than ever and preserving the security and privacy that our 
customers deserve. Public betas of OS X El Capitan and iOS 9 are available 
now and customer versions
 
of all three updated OSs are on schedule and will 
be delivered in the fall.
 
We're very excited about our news app coming to iPhone and iPad with iOS 
9. We believe it will be the best news reading experience on any mobile 
device, combining a beautiful maga
zine layout with real
-
time customized 
digital media content. News will follow over a million topics and pull relevant 
stories based on the user's specific interests without compromising their 
privacy. We've already signed 25 leading publishers, representin
g more than 
75 of the world's most influential news, sports, business and magazine titles, 
including CNN, the New York Times, the Financial Times, ESPN, Bloomberg 
Business, Condé Nast, Hearst, Reuters, Time, Inc. and The Daily Telegraph.
 
The September quar
ter is off to an exciting start. We're thrilled by the 
response to Apple Music, which launched in over 100 countries on June 30. 
Apple Music is a single immersive app that combines the best ways to enjoy 
music all in one place. It's an incredible streaming
 
music service, a 
pioneering worldwide live radio station broadcasting 24 hours a day, and a 
great place for music fans to connect with their favorite artist. Customers 
and reviewers love the human curation features of Apple Music and the way 
it's helping 
people discover new music.
 
Millions and millions of customers are already experiencing the new service 
using the three
-
month trial period, and the numbers are growing 
substantially every day. Over 15,000 artists have signed up to post on 
Connect, where we 
are already seeing great original content, including a 
world premiere video by Drake. Millions of listeners around the world are 
tuning in to Beats 1, the first of its kind worldwide radio station featuring 
some of the most talented and passionate music lo
vers on the planet. This 
all adds up to a renewed sense of excitement around music, which we love 
and expect to continue as Apple Music gets traction with customers.
 
Last week we launched Apple Pay in the UK, bringing customers our easy, 
secure and private
 
way to pay. On day one, we had an incredible roster of 
over 250,000 locations and major credit and debit cards from many of the 
UK's most established banks supporting Apple Pay. Customers are using 
Apple Pay to ride the London Underground as well as the o
ver ground 
systems of Transport for London and we hope this will be a model for other 
public transportation systems around the world.
 
In the US, we've seen fantastic support from merchants of all sizes. We are 
excited to see this momentum continue with the
 
new Square reader coming 
this fall. It will bring Apple Pay to even more neighborhood businesses where 
you pay every day, from your corner coffee shop to your local farmer's 
market, bolstering the 80,000 small
-
 
and medium
-
size businesses we're 
already add
ing every month. American Express will add Apple Pay support 
for its robust portfolio of corporate cards next month, offering businesses 
and their employees a new way to make easy and secure payments. And as 
we head into the school year, 700 universities a
nd colleges across the US 
will accept Apple Pay such as Auburn University, the University of California 
Irvine, Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky and the 
University of Oklahoma, among many others. We're on track for Apple Pay 
acceptance
 
at over 1.5 million US locations by the end of 2015.
 
I'd like to thank our customers, developers, business partners and 
employees for another record breaking quarter. We're very hard at work on 
our exciting pipeline of new hardware, software and services,
 
and we're 
continuing to expand our global reach into new markets. And we're 
passionately committed to leaving the world better than we found it.
 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri

Senior Vice President and Chief Financial 
Officer
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As we have done for the first 
half of our fiscal 2015, we are reporting another record quarter today. 
Revenue for the June quarter was $49.6 billion, an increase of $12.2 billion 
or 33% year over year. Our 
growth was driven by the tremendous 
performance of iPhone, the introduction of Apple Watch and the continued 
strength of Mac and App Store sales. We achieved these great results in the 
context of a very challenging foreign exchange environment around the 
w
orld and a reduction in channel inventory of over 1 million units across our 
product lines, which makes our growth performance even more remarkable.
 
As Tim mentioned, our results were especially impressive in Greater China, 
where revenue more than doubled 
year over year to over $13 billion. 
Emerging markets overall grew 79% to almost $18 billion and represented 
35% of our total company revenue. Company gross margin was 39.7%, 
better than our expectations, mainly due to strong iPhone sales. Operating 
margin 
was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion, a new June 
quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, a 45% year
-
over
-
year increase and cash flow from operations was $15 billion, also a new third 
quarter record.
 
For details by product I'
ll start with iPhone. We sold 47.5 million iPhones in 
the quarter, representing 35% year over year growth and demand for 
iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has continued to be terrific all around the world. iPhone 
sales more than doubled in Germany, Korea, Malaysia, and 
Vietnam. We're 
up over 85% in Greater China and in India, and increased more than 45% in 
several countries including Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey.
 
The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus led to an iPhone ASP of $660, an 
increase of $99 year over 
year, despite the significant negative foreign 
exchange impact I referred to earlier. We reduced iPhone channel inventory 
by about 600,000 units during the quarter, which left us at the low end of 
our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory.
 
Next
 
I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.8 million Macs, representing 
9% year
-
over
-
year growth. As we have done for several years in a row, we 
continued to gain significant market share based on IDC's latest estimate of 
a 12% global PC market contraction
. Mac growth was driven by portables 
and we are delighted with the very strong customer reception of our new 
MacBook. We ended the quarter slightly below our 4 to 5 week target range 
for Mac channel inventory.
 
Turning to iPad. We sold 10.9 million compared
 
to 13.3 million in the year
-
ago quarter. iPad sell
-
through was 11.2 million as we reduced channel 
inventory by about 300,000 units. This left us within our 5 to 7 week target 
range of iPad channel inventory. iPad customer metrics continue to be 
extremely 
positive. ChangeWave recently measured a 97% customer 
satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a 
tablet within 90 days, over half plan to purchase an iPad. For corporate 
buyers, the purchase intent was even stronger at over
 
70%.
 
We do not participate in the low end of the tablet market, but we are 
extremely successful where we do compete. NPD recently indicated that iPad 
has 76% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. We're very 
excited about the advances in th
e iPad experience coming in iOS 9 in the 
fall, including the slide over and split view features for retail multitasking, 
picture
-
in
-
picture for FaceTime and video, and enhanced QuickType for 
composing text even faster.
 
We're also seeing great momentum in t
he enterprise market. For instance, 
riding on the success of iPad use by its pilots, United Airlines has not only 
renewed its iPad program with more than 10,000 iPad Air 2s, but has also 
made a strategic decision to provide iPhones to over 20,000 flight 
at
tendants. In the near future, United plans to introduce new apps to 
transform the customer experience and improve integration with flight 
operations.
 
We're also very happy with the progress of our IBM partnership. IBM 
released 13 new MobileFirst for iOS ap
ps in the June quarter, including new 
apps in retail banking and healthcare, as well as new horizontal apps for HR 
and sales. There are now 35 apps in IBM's MobileFirst for iOS catalog that 
connect users to big data and analytics right on their iPads or iP
hones. And 
we expect a total of 100 apps to be available by the end of 2015.
 
Active customer engagements have also grown to over 500 and recent 
notable customer wins include Air Canada, National Grid in the UK and 
Banorte in Mexico. In April, Apple, IBM an
d Japan Post announced a joint 
initiative to deliver iPads with IBM developed apps and analytics to connect 
Japanese senior citizens with services, healthcare, community and family. 
Japan Post hopes to reach 4 million to 5 million Japanese customers with 
t
hese solutions by 2020. Since announcing this initiative less than three 
months ago, we've already seen strong interest from other countries looking 
for innovative ways to support an aging population.
 
Importantly, we also continue to work closely with lead
ing business software 
and solution providers to help businesses of all sizes transform work with 
iPad and iPhone. The number of these mobility partners has expanded 
rapidly to over 40. They're developing new and differentiated solutions on 
iOS across many 
industries, and attracting very significant customer 
interest.
 
Turning to services. We generated over $5 billion in revenue, a new all
-
time 
record, and an increase of 12% over last year thanks primarily to strong 
growth from apps. The revenue from the App 
Store increased 24% and the 
number of transacting customers grew 19%, also setting an all
-
time record. 
Services growth was particularly strong in China, where the App Store 
revenue more than doubled year over year. China based developers have 
created 250,0
00 apps for our China App Store and the response from our 
customers has been tremendous.
 
The revenue from other products grew sharply, up 49% over last year. The 
contribution from Apple Watch accounted for well over 100% of the growth 
of the category, and 
more than offset the decline of iPod and accessory 
sales. As we've said in the past, we do not plan to disclose Apple Watch 
metrics because we don't intend to provide insight that could help our 
competitors.
 
Our retail and online stores had a very busy qua
rter, with customer visits up 
49% year
-
over
-
year, driven especially by the very strong interest in Apple 
Watch. Thanks to our very popular Apple Store app, mobile traffic to our 
online stores during the quarter equaled desktop traffic for the first time 
ev
er. We opened three new stores, our second store in Brazil, our sixth store 
in Manhattan, and our twenty
-
second store in Greater China. That brought 
us to a global store count of 456, of which 190 are outside the United 
States, and we are on track to have 
40 stores open in Greater China by the 
middle of next year.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $202.8 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $9.3 
billion. $181 billion of this cash, or 89% of the t
otal, was offshore. In the 
June quarter, we issued a total of $10 billion of term debt, consisting of $8 
billion US dollar denominated notes and ¥250 billion denominated notes as 
we continue to diversify our global debt investor base. This left us with $50
 
billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter.
 
During the quarter, we turned over $13 billion to our investors. We paid $3.1 
billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $4 billion to repurchase 
31.2 million Apple shares to open market t
ransactions. We also launched a 
$6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May and received an 
initial delivery of 38.3 million shares. The purchase period for the new ASR 
will end in or before November of 2015.
 
We have continued to execute our cap
ital return program at a fast pace and 
we now take an action on over $126 billion of our $200 billion program, 
including $90 billion in share repurchases. The weighted average price for all 
open market purchases and completed ASR programs to date is $86.
 
N
ow as we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our 
outlook, which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$49 billion and $51 billion compare
d to $42.1 billion in the year
-
ago quarter. 
We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx 
to be between $5.850 billion and $5.950 billion. We expect OI&E to be about 
$400 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.
 
Also tod
ay our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per 
share of common stock payable on August 15, 2015 to shareholders of 
record as of August 10, 2015.
 
With that, let's open the call to questions.
 
Nancy Paxton

tions and Treasury
 
We ask that you limit yourself to one, one

up.

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operation Instructions] First we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Kathryn L. Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. While the year on year iPhone growth was very 
attractive, the sequential unit decline in the June quarter was worse than the 
past two years. Why do you think that was, 
and in particular, why drain 
channel inventory when iPhone 6 is selling so well? And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Katy, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned, the channel inventory did go down by 
600,000. We sold more
 
units than we thought we would and so that was a 
part of that. The other part of it is that we always run with just the amount 
of inventory that we think we need. And so to the degree that sales are 
distributed in the countries with disproportionally with
 
shorter supply chains, 
or the standard deviation demand is less, we would always choose to have 
less.
 
And so in this particular quarter, we were able to end basically right at the 
bottom end of our range and we view that as a good thing, not a bad thing. 
Obviously the revenues could have been much higher if we would have 
expanded the channel, but if you don't need to do that, that's not how we 
think about the business. We run the business for the long term, not the 90
-
day clock.
 
In terms of what's going on
 
with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost three 
times the market. And if you look at it at a little narrower regional level, 
Western Europe grew 30% versus a market of 7%, so four times market. 
Japan grew over five times market. We doubled in Korea versus a m
arket 
that was shrinking. And India we grew at 93% and this is on top of the 
Greater China numbers that we've already covered that grew 87% during 
the quarter against a market of 5%. And so we did exceptionally well I think 
in any way that you look at it.
 
In terms of the percentage of customers that have upgraded to a 6 and 6 
Plus versus that have not upgraded, it's 73%, or meaning that 27% of the 
installed base of customers prior to the launch of 6 and 6 Plus have now 
upgraded. And so we view that as a ver
y bullish sign on the future, that 
there's a lot of headroom left for upgraders. We also are incredibly happy to 
see the highest Android switcher rate that we've observed. And so from our 
point of view, the iPhone is doing outstanding.
 
Kathryn L. Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
So Tim, just to extend that conversation to the longer term, as I'm sure 
you're aware, you're lapping some pretty significant comps as it relates to 
the upgrades that you're talking about as well as significant growth in China. 
Wh
at is the framework that you use to convince yourselves that iPhone units 
can continue to grow over the longer term?
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Well you know, Katy, we purposely just give guidance for the current quarter 
and we've
 
done that. And obviously the kind of numbers that we have 
indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another 
stellar quarter. And so we're very confident that this quarter is going to be 
great. How the future looks, we'll take it one qua
rter at a time. But as I back 
up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view, the things that 
makes me very bullish is the 27% number I just quoted, the fact that we are 
seeing the highest Android switcher rate, the customer satisfaction that we
 
have on the iPhone versus the competition. It's a huge margin. The loyalty 
rate that we have versus competition, an enormous gap there.
 
I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and we're still seeing very, very 
large numbers in the countries that you w
ould want to see those in, like 
China and Russia and Brazil and so forth. I also see a market that over a 
five
-
year horizon, if you look at the IDC numbers, is projected to grow from 
1.3 million in 2014 to over 1.9 billion 

 
this is billion, rather, billio
n in 2019. 
And so it's an incredible market. I think everybody's going to own a 
smartphone, and I think we've proven that we can compete for a fair 
number of those, as you can see from our results.
 
Kathryn L. Huberty

Great. Thank
 
you very much.
 
Nancy Paxton

Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury
 
Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
 
William C. Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay, great. Thank 
you. Could you walk us through the key factors behind 
your gross margin range for the September quarter and in particular how we 
should think about the sequential ForEx impact this quarter and the impact 
of a potential product transition cost?
 
Luca Maestri
 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Definitely. This is Luca. So we got into 38.5% to 39.5%, and so just keep in 
mind last year in Q4, our gross margin declined by 140 basis points 
sequentially. So this year we're expecting a sequential de
cline of 220 basis 
points. I would point to three main factors for the decline. First of all, to your 
point around foreign exchange, it continues to be a challenging environment 
given the strengthening of the US dollar. In our case, the impact on margin 
af
ter the hedges is going to be about 30 basis points for Q4. Also, I want to 
point to a different mix, which is typical of our seasonality as we enter the 
back
-
to
-
school season during Q4. And thirdly, the transition cost that you've 
mentioned as we prepare 
for a busy fall. And so those are the three factors 
that will have an impact on gross margin sequentially. I would point that in 
general costs continue to be, particularly commodity costs continue to be 
favorable and so there would be a partial offset to t
he factors that I 
mentioned.
 
William C. Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay, thanks. And then could you give us a bit more color on the mix 
dynamics for the iPhone in the June quarter and how this compares to prior 
generations and your expectations? Obviously
 
there continues to be an 
upward bias helping the ASPs as you mentioned, but could you give us a bit 
more detail on what exactly you're seeing here? Particularly I think it's 
interesting in the context of a continued tilt towards the emerging regions 
obvio
usly.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, so as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase 
year
-
over
-
year and this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've 
added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price poin
t and in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus 
are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio. And keep in mind 
that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange. So 
the number would have been even better. So yes, clearly 6 and 6 
Plus. And I 
think we talked about it in prior calls, the 6 Plus is doing particularly well in 
the markets that you would expect, Greater China, other Asian markets. 
Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the 6 
Plus, because of
 
the screen size, is doing extremely well.
 
William C. Shope

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
All right. Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton

Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury
 
Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from 
Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
 
Eugene C. Munster

Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
 
Hi, good afternoon. Luca, you talked a little bit about gross margins in the 
previous question. But could you talk about how we should think about the 
trends in the gross marg
in? In other words is, should the margin trends that 
we've seen in other cycles continue into next year? And then a follow
-
up or 
another question for Tim here, is that the Watch has been under a lot of 
interest from investors and some may have wanted a lit
tle bit more. You 
outlined some of the opportunities and some of the progress you've had. But 
any thoughts that you have for investors who may say that the category is 
just not taking off as fast as they would have hoped?

Okay Gene, let me start with gross margin. As Tim said before, obviously we 
guide to the current quarter. You know, as we look at it at a macro level. I 
think there are, you know every cycle is different for a variety of reas
ons. 
There are also things that are not necessarily within our control. So for 
example, currency markets can be very different one year to the next. We 
know that the next year is going to represent an additional challenge given 
where the dollar has moved. 
Commodity markets may be very different from 
one year to the other.
 
There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products. 
For example, we innovate the products. We want to make them better all 
the time, and that typically requires addi
tional cost and so the cost 
structures of our products, new products, tend to be higher than the 
products that they replace. Having said that, as you know we've got a very, 
very good track record to reduce those cost factors over the lifecycle of the 
produ
cts. I think this should give you a bit of color. Of course maybe the one 
thing that I want to point out again as we get into the following year, is that 
of course currency will be an issue.

Yeah Gene, this is Tim. Let me talk about the Watch some. As you know, we 
made a decision back in September, quite several months ago not to 
disclose the shipments on the Watch and that was not a matter 
of not being 
transparent, it was a matter of not giving our competition insight that's a 
product that we've worked really hard on. However, let me give you some 
color so to avoid reaching sort of a wrong conclusion. If you look at the 
other products catego
ry and look at the revenue in this category, it would 
not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year 
over year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue because 
the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially
 
and year over 
year, is shrinking. Obviously iPod is a part of that, but there are other things 
in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking.
 
Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our 
expectations and they did so des
pite supply still trailing demand at the end 
of the quarter. And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of 
the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell
-
through was higher than the 
comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the origi
nal iPad. And we 
were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale. And as you 
probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at 
the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid
-
June. And so those p
oints of sale pretty much, the overwhelming majority of 
the low numbers of sales were not there until the last two weeks of the 
quarter.
 
And so as I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did. 
Now our objective for the quarter wasn'
t primarily sales. Beyond the very 
good news on sales, we're more excited about how the product is positioned 
for the long term because we're starting a new category. And as I back up 
and look at this, we have 8,500 apps. We've already announced the next 
o
perating system, watchOS 2. It will bring native apps which are going to be 
killer to the Watch. Even though the store layout was delayed, we've learned 
a lot about the buying experience. Based on that experience, we're now 
planning to expand our channel b
efore the holiday because we're convinced 
that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season.
 
Now most importantly of all of this is that customer sat is off the charts 
because we've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off
 
the charts 
you can wind up doing fairly well over time. We've also learned a lot about 
managing quite an assortment and so forth. And so I sort of back up and 
look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered 
and I know I never 
go anywhere without the Watch and it's not because I'm 
the CEO of Apple. I'm that attached to it and I get lots of notes from a lot of 
people that feel the same way. And so that's how I look at the Watch.

From Bernstein we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. Luca, I think in your prepared remarks you talked a little b
it 
about your market share of iPad in the US above $200 being 78%. And I'm 
wondering if you think about the iPhone and your market share in the 
premium category, how do you think about it? So I've seen market data that 
says 60% market share for phones abov
e $300 or you have actually 90% 
market share for phones above $600. And I'm wondering if, Tim or Luca, 
you could maybe talk about how you think about your market share, where 
you play given that your ASP is comfortably above $600? What do you think 
your ma
rket share is above $500 or $600 in smartphones? And how do we 
think about that, that market share going forward?
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Toni, it's Tim. We look at it a bit differently than you do. We look at it as our 
job is 
to grow our products regardless of the price, which means that we 
need to convince in some cases people to move from one price band to the 
other. And that we think if we do a great job with the product that people 
will be willing to spend more because they
 
get so much more out of it. And I 
think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action. I 
mean, we grew 87% in China. We grew 90%
-
plus in India. Emerging 
markets are growing 65%. These numbers are unbelievable and they're 
done in an envi
ronment where it's not the best of conditions. So that's how 
we look at. We don't do the MBA analysis of there's only X people buying in 
a price band and therefore we can only get X minus Y percent. That's not the 
way we've ever looked at it. If we did, we
 
wouldn't be shipping any 
products.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Tim, I'm asking in part because you talked about the highest ever Android 
switcher. So I'm wondering if indeed your goal of expanding the category is 
happening or wh
ether you are taking share and how do you measure the 
relative contribution of each of those in your success. So is the strength and 
the dramatically above market growth because you're taking share in that 
high
-
end category and how far along are you there?
 
Or can you point to 
proof points that you've actually expanded the size of the market for 
products of your price point?
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Oh, I think there's no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market 
size in
 
those areas. It's also true that there's some people that are switching 
from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too. But I think 
the answer is that both of those things are happening and it's key that we do 
both, not just one.
 
Antonio
 
M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. And then if I could just ask you to comment on how you think about 
replacement cycles with the current iPhone 6 cycle. So when you look at 
replacement cycles over the last three quarters, are they 
similar to what you 
saw one and two years ago when you think about replacement? And one of 
the things that also sort of struck me was I think you cited market research 
having repurchase intention of 86% versus your competitors at 50%. Quite 
frankly, the 86
% sounds low to me. Is that actually consistent with what you 
see in the marketplace, about 86% of iPhone buyers ultimately buy another 
iPhone? So perhaps we can think about replacement cycle.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Yes.
 
Anton
io M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
And how that's changed and the percentage number and how that jives with 
reality?
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
The 86% also seems low to me but I was quoting a third
-
party source and
 
not our own data. Our own data would look better than that. But the 
numbers are only comparable if I quote the third
-
party source for both and 
so that's what I'm doing.
 
On the upgrade cycle and what we're seeing, it's not remarkably different. 
However, th
ere's a number of plans that people began signing up for in the 
last year that could change it. These are upgrade any time kind of plans. 
They may be one year leases that could actually help the upgrade rate. And 
I think it'll be interesting to see how tha
t plays out over the next horizon. 
But generally speaking, I see positive vectors there, not negative, in the 
aggregate.

We'll

James D. Suva

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Thank you very much. As you look at many of your products have been 
absolutely fantastic and at different phases in their life, they've seen 
tremendous high growth, whether i
t's iPad, iPhone, iPod, and iPhone looks 
like it's facing some very challenging comps here in the next few quarters. 
Does this make you shift even more strategic focus into broadening the 
reliance on a couple products such as you mentioned Apple Radio. The
re's a 
lot more content on the Apple Watch and apps and then also Apple Pay. Are 
you increasingly focusing on hiring and kind of non hardware things (45:32)? 
Or are these kind of more peripheral activities and still the focus is kind of 
right now on the ph
one?
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Jim, it's Tim. We think the phone has a lot of legs to it. I mean, many, 
many, many years. There's tons of innovation left at the phone. I think we're 
in the early innings of it, not in the late 
innings, and I think the market rate 
of growth over the long haul will also be impressive. And so there will be 
multiple winners here. And so that's how I see it.
 
In terms of the other things that we're doing, we have some great capability 
and great teams 
in Apple. And so we can do more than one thing, and so we 
have other things that we're working on as well. But at the aggregate level, 
we still remain very focused because if you look at our size versus the 
number of projects we have going, it's much small
er compared to most. But 
that's how we do things and that's how we get the level of quality that we 
want out of each one of those.
 
And so the other things that you named, whether it be Apple Music or Apple 
Pay, both of these are very important to us. And t
hings that you didn't 
mention, the Mac continues to perform very well. I am still bullish on iPad. 
We've gotten with iOS 9, there's some incredible productivity enhancements 
coming in with split view and slide over and picture
-
in
-
picture. These things 
are 
incredible features. The enterprise business is clearly picking up and 
more and more companies are either contracting for or writing apps 
themselves. I think and I believe that the iPad consumer upgrade cycle will 
eventually occur because as we look at the
 
usage statistics on iPad, it 
remains unbelievably great. I mean, the next closest usage of the next 
competitor, we're six times greater.
 
And so these are extraordinary numbers. It's not like people have forgotten 
iPad or anything. It's a fantastic product
. So I see a lot of runway. And as I 
look geographically, where we've been doing really good in the emerging 
markets, our share is still not high in any of them, and so there's a lot of 
headroom there as well, as there is in most developed markets as well.
 
And 
so I look around, I see opportunity left and right. And that's what we're 
focused on.

We'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
 
Steven M. Milunovich

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thank you. Tim, there's some concern about what's going on in China with 
the stock market and economically. How do you think tha
t plays out for 
Apple? On one hand you've got more stores, broader distribution, the 4G 
infrastructure is playing out. On the other hand, the economy might be 
weakening. Is a phone a discretionary purchase or not? How do you think 
about going forward in Ch
ina?
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Yeah, it's a very good question, and we remain extremely bullish on China 
and we're continuing to invest. Nothing that's happened has changed our 
fundamental view that China will be Apple's 
largest market at some point in 
the future. It's true, as you point out, that the equity markets have recently 
been volatile. This could create some speed bumps in the near term. But to 
put it in context, which I think is important, despite that volatility
 
in the 
Chinese market, they're still up 90% over the last year, and they're up 20% 
year
-
to
-
date, and so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us 
would love.
 
Also, the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly 
narrow. And the 
stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who 
put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than 
we might. And so I think generally this has been, at least as we see it, 
maybe it's not true for other businesses, that thi
s worry is probably 
overstated. And so we're not changing anything. We have the pedal to the 
metal on getting to 40 stores mid next year. As we had talked about before, 
we're continuing to expand the indirect channel as well.
 
As you point out, and I think 
this is a major point that many people miss, 
the LTE penetration in China is only at 12%. And China doesn't possess the 
level of fiber that some other countries do, and so in order to get the great 
video performance, et cetera, raising that penetration is 
really great. I think 
that really plays to an incredible smartphone future there.
 
Also, and I can't underestimate 

 
I can't overstate this. The rise of the 
middle class there is continuing, and it is transforming China. McKinsey, I 
saw a recent study from 
McKinsey that's projecting the upper middle class to 
grow from 14% to 54% of households over the ten
-
year period from 2012 to 
2022. So we're within that period at this moment, and you can see for all of 
us that travel there so much, with every trip you can
 
see this occurring. And 
so I think we would be foolish to change our plans. I think China is a 
fantastic geography with an incredible unprecedented level of opportunity 
there. And we're going to be there.

I also w
anted to ask, can you give us any more detail on the switching rate, 
how much is it up? And I noticed in your advertising there's the shift to the, 
if it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone. And I assume that while you're not 
as involved as Jobs was, you'r
e approving these ads. So it seems like you're 
really focused on market share gain right now.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Yeah, I'm very familiar with the ads. In certain geographies, the way that we 
win is to get switchers. In oth
er geographies, the way that we win is to get 
people to buy their first smartphone. In other geographies, the way that we 
win is to get people to upgrade from their current iPhone. And all of those 
are very important for us. In many geographies, it's two o
f those or in some 
geographies it's all three of those. And so all of those are important. We are 
very focused on growing iPhone around the world, not just in one geography 
and getting our message out there through ads is one way to do that.

Cross Res
earch LLC
 
Thank you very much. I wanted to talk about FX but not necessarily from a 
direct impact. But what are you seeing in terms of demand as you've raised 
prices in various geographies and how are you thinking about it as you go 
into sort of the next i
Phone cycle in terms of having to sort of normalize the 
pricing for what some of the currencies have done over the past year?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes, Shannon. So obviously FX has been a significant hit in many 
ways, of 
course. I mean it reduces our growth rate. We would be 800 basis points 
higher this quarter from the 33% that we've reported if it wasn't for the 
movement in currencies around the world. And really when you look around 
the world, it's really if yo
u exclude China, essentially every single currency 
has weakened against the dollar. We are pretty careful and thoughtful about 
where we increase prices and when and by how much during mid
-
cycle 
because it's not something that we particularly like to do. We
've had 
circumstances around the world this year where frankly we didn't have many 
options because the currency movement was so large and so we've had to 
reprice.
 
I have to say that it's been remarkable. Look, in the long run a strong US 
dollar is not a po
sitive for our international business. It's normal to see a 
drop in demand when prices go up. That goes without saying. It has been 
remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets. But really 
remarkable to see how resilient iPhone sales h
ave been, because we have 
increased, in spite of these price increases, we've increased sales and we've 
increased market share in all our geographies around the world, without 
exception.
 
Shannon S. Cross 
-
 
Cross Research LLC
 
Great. And then can you talk a 
bit about linearity during the quarter on a 
geographic basis? Somewhat going back to the China question, I mean did 
you see it slow down toward the end of the quarter? Or was it solid through 
it? And just any other color you can give geographically with Eu
rope and 
some of the other macro events that are going on.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Yeah, Shannon, it's Tim. Maybe the best way to talk about this is sort of at 
the product level. On the Watch, our June sales were higher than Ap
ril or 
May. I realize that's very different than what some of the, is being written, 
but the June sales were the highest. And so the Watch had a more of a 
back
-
ended kind of a skewing. The phone itself followed what I would call a 
normal seasonal kind of p
attern. And if you look at the 

 
it sounds like 
you're honing in on the Greater China results themselves. There is no 
obvious impact from the last quarter in the Greater China numbers. And 
obviously with the aggregate or the consolidated number being 112%,
 
it's 
hard to find a lot of bad things in the numbers.

Tim Cook
 
Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us 
today.
 
We're thrilled to report a return to growth and new June quarter revenue 
record of $53.8 billion. We saw significan
t improvement in year
-
over
-
year 
iPhone performance compared to last quarter, very strong performances for 
both Mac and iPad and absolutely blowout quarter for Wearables, but we had 
accelerating growth of well over 50% and a new high watermark for 
services,
 
where we set an all time revenue record of $11.5 billion. When you 
step back and consider Wearables and services together two areas where we 
have strategically invested in last several years, they now approach the size 
of a Fortune 50 company.
 
Geographica
lly, we are happy with our performance across the board 
including a return to growth in Mainland China. We accomplished these 
results despite strong headwinds from foreign exchange which impacted our 
top
-
line growth rate by 300 basis points compared to a y
ear ago that's 
equivalent to about $1.5 billion of revenue. Importantly, in constant 
currency, our revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments.
 
For iPhone, we generated $26 billion in revenue, while this is down 12% 
from last year's June quarter, i
t is a significant improvement to the 17% 
year
-
over
-
year decline in Q2. We are encouraged by the results we are 
seeing from the initiatives that we spoke about in January including strong 
customer response to our in
-
store trade
-
in and financing programs.
 
I
n fact, iPhone our retail and online stores returned to growth on a year
-
over
-
year basis in the month of June. Our active installed base of iPhone 
reached a new all time high and was up year
-
over
-
year in each of our top 20 
markets underscoring the quality 
of our products and the satisfaction and 
loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.
 
Revenue excluding iPhone was up 17% from last year with growth across all 
categories. Starting with services, we generated all time record revenue of 
$11.5 billion that'
s up 13% year
-
over
-
year and if we exclude the $236 
million favorable one
-
time item from the June quarter last year, services 
growth was 15% or 18% in constant currency which is consistent with our 
Q2 performance. Our strong services performance was broad b
ased, we set 
new all
-
time records for AppleCare, music, cloud services and our app store 
search ad business and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for 
the app store.
 
What's more, we had double
-
digit services revenue growth in all five of our 
ge
ographic segments. We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to 
services across our platform and we remain on track to double our fiscal 
year '16 services revenue in 2020.
 
In May, we launched our all new Apple TV app in over 100 countries bringing 
togeth
er all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple 
TV and select smart TV's. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United 
States are up over 40% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We've seen our success being driven here by several factors. First, th
e fact 
that we have been able to integrate content from over 150 leading content 
providers all in one place. Second, the same ease
-
of
-
use and unmatched 
user interface that sets Apple apart in other categories sets us apart in TV as 
well. And third, we're b
enefiting from a broader secular move to over
-
the
-
top services.
 
We're engaging with this third trend in five ways. Our Apple TV hardware, 
Apple TV channels where customers can choose to pay only for the channels 
they want. Our massive library of over 100,0
00 iTunes movies and TV 
shows, the app store where users can find their favorite streaming services 
and later this year, our original programming service Apple TV+.
 
Apple Pay is now completing nearly 1 billion transactions per month more 
than twice the vol
ume of a year ago. Apple Pay launched in 17 countries in 
the June quarter completing our coverage in the European Union and 
bringing us to a total of 47 markets currently. Based on June quarter 
performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPa
l and 
monthly transaction volume is growing 4x as fast.
 
In the United States, in addition to a successful integration into Portland's 
transit system in May, we're beginning to rollout of New York City transit and 
will launch in Chicago later this year. In 
China, Apple Pay launched the 
payment card for Didi the world's largest ride hailing provider.
 
As I've said before, transit integration is a major driver of a broader digital 
wallet adoption, and we're going to keep up this push to help users leave 
their w
allet at home in more and more instances.
 
On a related note, thousands of Apple employees are using Apple Card every 
day in our beta test, and we plan to begin the rollout of Apple Card in 
August.
 
As I mentioned at the outset, it was another sensational qu
arter for 
Wearables, with growth accelerating to well over 50%. We had great results 
for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is 
reaching millions of new users. Over 75% of customers buying Apple Watch 
in the June quarter were buyin
g their first Apple Watch. We continue to see 
phenomenal demand for AirPods. And when you tally up the last four 
quarters, our wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies 
in the Fortune 500.
 
We had great performance from iPad, with revenue o
f over $5 billion, and 
growth driven by iPad Pro and by strong customer response to the new iPad 
Mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth, and with 
revenue up 15% year
-
to
-
date, we feel great about where we're headed with 
iPad. Wi
th our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've 
got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.
 
We were also very happy with double
-
digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled 
by a strong performance of MacBook A
ir and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, 
there's an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of 
our Mac mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought 
significant updates to the bulk of our notebook lineup in the last couple of 
m
onths. We now have a $999 MacBook Air that is killer for college students. 
And for our pro users, who push the limits of what a Mac can do, we were 
thrilled to unveil the most powerful Mac ever, the new Mac Pro and the all 
new Pro Display XDR, which will b
e available this fall. They're designed for 
maximum performance, expansion and configurability and at breakthrough 
pricing and they're the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands 
of pro customers.
 
What's more, the Mac ecosystem as a whole is ab
out to get a big boost. At 
our recent Worldwide Developers Conference, we announced a game
-
changing tool to help developers easily adapt their iOS and iPadOS apps for 
the Mac. I'll have a bit more to say on that in a moment.
 
I'd like to provide some color 
on our performance in Greater China, where 
we saw significant improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and 
return to growth in constant currency. We experienced noticeably better 
year
-
over
-
year comparisons for our iPhone business there than we
 
saw in 
the last two quarters and we had sequential improvement in the 
performance of every category. The combined effects of government 
stimulus, consumer response to trade
-
in programs, financing offers, and 
other sales initiatives and growing engagement 
with the broader Apple 
ecosystem had a positive effect. We were especially pleased with a double
-
digit increase in services driven by strong growth from the App Store in 
China.
 
Turning to the future. Last week we announced an agreement with Intel to 
acquire the majority of its smartphone modem business. This is our second
-
largest acquisition by dollars and our largest ever in terms of staff. We're 
looking forward to welcoming all of them to Apple. We see this as a great 
opportunity to work with some o
f the leading talents in this field, to grow our 
portfolio of wireless technology patents to over 17,000, to expedite our 
development of our future products and to further our long
-
term strategy of 
owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the
 
products that we 
make.
 
We also had our best WWDC ever last month, packed with announcements 
of great new features coming this fall across our four software platforms 
making them more powerful, more personal and more private.
 
For iPhone users, iOS 13 will 
take on a dramatic new look with Dark Mode, 
while delivering major updates to the apps you use every day, including 
photos, camera and maps. iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you 
manage your privacy and security, including Sign On with Apple, which uses
 
Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and Web sites without sharing 
your personal information. And improvements across the entire system will 
make iPhone even faster and more delightful to use than ever before.
 
For the first time, iPad is getting 
its own version of iOS, called iPadOS, a 
strategic step forward that takes the iPad experience to a whole new level. 
The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools and deeper 
integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity furth
er, 
including using your iPad as an extended and interactive second monitor for 
your Mac.
 
For Apple TV, tvOS 13 will make the big
-
screen experience even more 
personal. With a redesigned home screen and multi
-
user support, everyone 
in the family can get a m
ore engaging and tailored experience with their 
favorite TV shows, movies, sports and news, along with Apple Music, photos 
and videos in iCloud, and an App Store with thousands of great games and 
apps.
 
watchOS 6 is a major step forward in helping Apple Wat
ch users stay 
healthy, active and connected. Apple Watch now has a dedicated App Store 
that users can access directly from the device and new watch faces, Siri 
enhancements, and music and audio features make Apple Watch more 
useful than ever. And of course
, we continue to innovate on Apple Watch's 
promise to be an intelligent guardian for your health. watchOS 6 includes 
powerful new features like notifications that warn about high decibel noise to 
protect your hearing and cycle tracking to aid in women's he
alth care 
decisions.
 
In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and a 
regular rhythm notifications to five additional European countries and added 
Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries 
and regions 
around the world, with more to come later this year. We're very 
proud of the muscle we've built in bringing regulated products like these to 
market. This is an important competency that creates exciting opportunities 
for us moving forward.
 
As I noted earli
er, we believe macOS Catalina will be a breakthrough in the 
Mac ecosystem. A new tool included in macOS Catalina called Mac Catalyst 
gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. 
Thousands of developers are already using it to 
bring their apps to the Mac 
ecosystem and we expect to see a wave of popular apps arriving for the Mac 
as early as this fall.
 
Again, it's worth taking a step back and digesting the bigger picture here. 
These updates are the latest steps in a broader strate
gic effort to make the 
user experience across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS more 
effortless and more intuitive. Apple is alone in offering this kind of value and 
ecosystem to its customers. And these devices and their platforms are 
unmatched in thei
r ease
-
of
-
use, their seamlessness and their privacy and 
security.
 
And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment 
where developers benefit greatly from creating for and distributing on these 
platforms. And our customers, of course, be
nefit greatly from access to all 
this creativity and innovation.
 
We also unveiled other exciting technologies to make it easier and faster for 
developers to create powerful new apps. SwiftUI provides an intuitive new 
framework for building sophisticated us
er interfaces across our software 
platforms using simple easy
-
to
-
use code. Core ML 3 supports the 
acceleration of more types of advanced real
-
time machine learning models, 
and Create ML lets developers build machine learning models without writing 
code.
 
We
 
have the world's largest augmented reality enabled platform and 
thousands of they ARKit
-
enabled applications in the App Store. Building on 
this strategy, and our momentum in this area, we introduced three new AR
-
based technologies. ARKit 3 uses on device,
 
real
-
time machine learning to 
recognize the human form and integrates people seamlessly into AR 
experiences.
 
RealityKit is a new developer framework built from the ground up to provide 
all the tools and technologies required to make AR objects virtually l
ifelike. 
And Reality Composer brings AR content creation to tens of millions of 
developers who have no 3D experience. Our developers are already running 
with these new technologies and we think our customers are going to love 
some of the apps that these cr
eators have in store in the months ahead.
 
On so many fronts there's an enormous amount to look forward to over the 
next few months, including the launch of new services like Apple Arcade, 
Apple TV+, and Apple Card. And without giving too much away, we have
 
several new products that we can't wait to share with you.
 
Until then, thanks for joining us today. And for more details on the June 
quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.
 
We're happy to rep
ort a June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion, up 1% 
year
-
over
-
year. We return to growth in spite of a difficult foreign exchange 
environment around the world, which impacted our year
-
over
-
year growth 
rate by 300 basis points. We set June quarter reve
nue records in the 
Americas, in Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and as Tim mentioned earlier 
all our geographic segments grew in constant currency.
 
Overall, products revenue was $42.4 billion, down 2% year
-
over
-
year, which 
is significantly better than t
he 8% decline in products revenue that we 
experienced during the first half of the fiscal year.
 
Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in 
Wearables, Mac and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all
-
time 
record of $11.5 billi
on. Excluding the one
-
time item, we highlighted a year 
ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services 
revenue growth was 15% and 18% in constant currency terms.
 
On a geographic basis, we saw marked improvement in our year
-
over
-
ye
ar 
comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal 
year, particularly in the BRIC countries, where year
-
over
-
year performance 
went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June 
quarter.
 
We set June quarte
r revenue records in several major developed markets, 
including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Australia and Korea. In 
emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong 
double digits in India and Brazil and we set new Q3 rec
ords in Thailand, 
Vietnam and the Philippines.
 
Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially and in line with our 
guidance. Products gross margin was 30.4% down about 80 basis points 
sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and product mix partial
ly offset 
by favorable cost. Services gross margin was 64.1%, up 30 basis points 
sequentially, primarily due to a favorable mix. Net income was $10 billion, 
diluted earnings per share were $2.18 and operating cash flow was 
$11,600,000,000.
 
Let me get into 
more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone 
revenue was $26 billion, down 12% compared to a year ago. This was 
significantly better year
-
over
-
year performance than last quarter's 17% 
decline, with sequential improvement in year
-
over
-
year compari
sons in 15 of 
our top 20 markets. Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to 
a new all time high in each of our geographic segments and in the U.S., the 
latest survey of consumers from 451 Research, indicates iPhone customer 
satisfaction of 9
9% for iPhone 10R, iPhone 10S and 10S Max combined. 
Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the 
September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones.
 
Turning to services, we reached an all
-
time revenue record in spite of 
foreign exchange headw
inds with double
-
digit growth from the App Store, 
Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple digit growth from 
Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. All geographic segments 
had double
-
digit growth in services revenue and set new June 
quarter 
records with all
-
time records in the Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific.
 
In total, services accounted for 21% of Apple revenue and 36% of gross 
margin dollars.
 
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of 
transacting account
s on our digital content stores reached a new all time 
high in the June quarter and the number of paid accounts grew strong 
double digits compared to last year. We now have over 420 million paid 
subscriptions across the services on our platforms and we are
 
well on our 
way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.
 
On the App Store, our growth accelerated sequentially. Our subscription 
business continues to grow strongly and is extremely diversified across 
many categories such as entertainme
nt, lifestyle, photo and video and 
music. Third
-
party subscription revenue grew by over 40% and across all 
third
-
party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.25% of total 
services revenue.
 
Among our many services records, it was our best 
quarter ever for 
AppleCare. We are seeing an increase in service contract attach rates and 
are expanding distribution of AppleCare through our partners. We also 
recently expanded our authorized service provider network and nearly 1000 
Best Buy stores acros
s the U.S. are now offering expert service and repairs 
for Apple products. This expansion provides customers with an even more 
convenient access to repairs using parts certified for safety, quality and 
reliability. In addition to Apple retail stores there 
are over 1800 third
-
party 
Apple authorized service providers in the U.S., which is 3x as many locations 
as three years ago.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.8 billion, up 11% 
compared to last year. Mac revenue grew in 4 of our 5 geograp
hic segments 
and set June quarter records in the U.S., Europe and Japan, as our overall 
market performance significantly outpaced the global PC industry. Nearly 
half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, 
with revenue growing 
in both developed and emerging markets and the 
active installed base of Macs again reached a new all time high.
 
We also had great results for iPad, with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%. iPad 
revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments, with a Q3 revenue 
record 
in Mainland China and double
-
digit growth in emerging markets. In total, 
over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were 
new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all time 
high.
 
The most recent survey
s from 451 Research measured a 94% customer 
satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers 
who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to 
purchase iPads.
 
Wearables, home and accessories revenue accelerated acro
ss all our 
geographic segments, growing 48% to over $5.5 billion and setting a June 
quarter record. This growth was fueled primarily by the strong performance 
of our wearables business, which was up well over 50% and has become the 
size of a Fortune 200 co
mpany over the last 12 months. In addition, we 
generated double
-
digit revenue growth from Apple TV and accessories 
during the quarter.
 
Our retail and online stores produce their best June quarter revenue ever, 
with double
-
digit revenue growth across Apple 
Watch, iPad, Mac and 
accessories. Our trade
-
in program is showing great momentum, with more 
than 5x the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago. We 
opened stunning new stores in the Carnegie Library in Washington D.C. and 
the busy Shinji Distric
t in Taipei as well as a beautiful new location in the 
Dallas Galleria. We ended the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 
countries alongside our online store presence in 35 countries.
 
In the enterprise market, we are gaining traction with our strategy o
f 
transforming major industries by expanding our leading positions in key 
functional areas to grow our reach and modernize customer and employee 
experiences.
 
In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by assets size 
are deploying Apple
 
products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across 
their organizations. iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred 
mobile devices for bankers on the go. For example, 60% of the biggest 
banks are supporting iPads for wealth managers.
 
In retail b
anking, two
-
thirds of top banks are deploying iPad for branch 
transformation and modernizing legacy interfaces with a unified iPad 
experience. One of the world's largest banks created an iPad suite that 
reduced customer on
-
boarding time from more than an h
our to just 12 
minutes. Bank branch employees are also using Apple Watch for 
communication and notifications and Apple TV for customer presentations 
from iPads using AirPlay.
 
Financial institutions also tell us that they receive positive feedback from 
leve
raging Apple solutions for direct customer engagement. American 
Express, Credit Suisse, Discover and T.D. Ameritrade have launched Apple 
Business Chat as a dynamic way to support and interact with customers.
 
The intuitive interface of messages on iOS enabl
es rich communication 
between customers and contact center staff. T.D. Ameritrade has also 
become the first brokerage in the world to enable immediate funding of 
accounts using Apple Pay, eliminating the 2 to 3 business days it used to 
take to fund account
s by wire transfer.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost 
$211 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term 
debt and reduced commercial paper by $2 billion during the quarter, leaving 
us with to
tal debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $102 billion at 
the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash 
neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders 
during the quarter, including $17 billion
 
through open
-
market repurchases of 
almost 88 million Apple shares and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.
 
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our 
outlook, which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nanc
y 
referred to at the beginning of the call.
 
We expect revenue to be between $61 million and $64 billion. This guidance 
includes almost $1 billion of year
-
over
-
year negative impact from foreign 
exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
 
We 
expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OINE to 
be about 200 million and we expect our tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also, 
today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share 
of common stock payable on 
August 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of 
August 12, 2019.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. 
Operator, may we have the first question, please.
 
Questio
n
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
The first question will come from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, two from me. 
First off, could you just talk about, when I think about the September 
quar
ter guide, it's implied I think up 16% or so sequentially. Historically, at 
least, in that guide has been in the 10% low double
-
digit kind of range. Just 
can you help us understand, what gives you the confidence for a better than 
seasonal guide in Septembe
r, either from a geo or product basis would be 
helpful.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Amit, it's Luca. Of course, this is our best estimate of where we think we will 
land. Clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non
-
iPhone categories. We have great mome
ntum in wearables. We mentioned 
that we were up almost 50% in the June quarter, or actually over 50% in 
the June quarter. Our services business, we set an all
-
time record in June. 
And so, these two categories have become really important and really large 
f
or us. And so, as we continue to grow, quickly that is going to help us as we 
go through the year. Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated 
almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Fair enough. That's reall
y helpful. And I guess if I just follow
-
up on China, 
impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing that despite all 
the headlines that are out there. Just curious, what are the few things that 
are driving the success in China, and how sustain
able do you think those 
changes are for Apple as you go forward.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes, Amit, Hi. It's Tim, and I apologize for my voice, I'm suffering from an 
allergy. But what happened last quarter in China was a confluence of things. 
The government stimulus, thi
s came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold 
one. We took some pricing action, we instituted our trade
-
in and financing 
programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on 
that as well. And we're seeing a growing engagement with th
e broader Apple 
ecosystem during the quarter. And so, when you look at it, each of our 
categories, iPhone, iPad, Mac, wearables, services, everything improved 
sequentially. So, we couldn't be happier with the progress. I would point out, 
I think I mentione
d in my comments, that we actually grew in constant 
currency for Greater China and we grew in Mainland China on a reported 
basis. So, there's several things going on there that are quite positive.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next 
question please.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about what's going on within 
services, some of the puts and takes? Luca, you gave us some color in terms 
of 
the growth rates in that, but I'm just curious and I know you won't talk 
about future products, but as you think about the opportunity, you think 

going on with China and that, is this
 
something that could reaccelerate, or 
again, the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong. But, 
how are you thinking about it?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. I think it's important to start with that 18% in constant currencies, 
Shannon. Our reported 
results are on a normalized basis, removing the one
-
time item from last year, was 15%. Clearly FX, plays a role around the 
world, 300 basis points of FX impact during the June quarter. In spite of 
that, it was an all
-
time record revenue. Our installed base
 
continues to grow. 
It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product 
categories, and that is very, very important for the services business.
 
I would say, I'll give you a bit more color around two offsetting factors 
around this 
performance during the June quarter. On one side, the App 
Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated 
sequentially. We had double
-
digit growth on the App Store in every 
geography. In China, we saw significant acceleration. As you know
, we tend 
to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles and the 
government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter. That 
has helped our performance there.
 
On the other side, AppleCare, I mentioned AppleCare was an all
-
time record 
in June, so really strong performance, but our growth has decelerated in 
AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected, because we are comping 
this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had significant 
success during the last 18 to 24 months
 
in really broadening our coverage of 
AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers. 
And obviously, as we go through the year those comps become a bit more 
difficult.
 
Having said all that, that we've given ourselves a couple of 
targets and we 
feel very confident about reaching those targets. The first one is that, we 
wanted to double the size of the services business from our fiscal 2016 to 
2020. We are on our way there. Paid subscriptions is another target, is 
important to us. I
t's an important way for us to monetize our ecosystem. We 
set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem 

 
And of course, as you mentioned, we're very exc
ited about the fact that 
we're going to be launching new services soon. As Tim said, we're starting 
the rollout of Apple Card in August, and there's two more very important 

App
le Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service, and then of course 
Apple TV+, which is our video streaming service. So obviously these services 
will help us carry on with the momentum that we had in services.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Great. Thank you. And this i
s probably for you too as well, Luca. Can you 
talk about gross margin? The guidance was pretty solid. Obviously, there are 
various things that are at play here. I know you mentioned $1 billion worth 
of top
-
line impact, I think from, currency last quarter. 
Then maybe if you 
can kind of talk about what went into your gross margin guidance.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 
basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. I would 
say on the 
positive, we expect to benefit from leverage. As you've seen from 
our revenue guidance, and from cost savings, because as you know the 
commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. On the negative side, 
the headwind on gross margins on a year
-
over
-
y
ear basis from foreign 
exchange is about 100 basis points. And so, we need to keep that in mind. 
But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Shannon. Could we have the next question please.
 
Operator
 
Our next question will co
me from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Yes. Thank you. I'd like to go back to the discussion around strength in 
China in the quarter and understand what linearity looked like. I ask because 
there was some industry data around the smartphone
 
market in China that 
seemed to deteriorate in the month of June, the App Store data deteriorated 

business and if it at all informs your outlook around the pace of the China 
business
 
as you go into September.
 
Tim Cook
 
Katy, it's Tim. We obviously took into account all of the information that we 
had and coming out with the guidance including linearity across last quarter 
and how this quarter has started. And so, we obviously look at th
at in quite 
much detail.
 
Katy Huberty
 
And then just on the App Store, appreciate there's not a lot of detail out 
around exact timing and even some pricing of the new services, but how 
should we think about the new services that launched in March impacting 
the overall services growth. Does that start to benefit the model in the back 
half of this calendar year, or will the impact be more longer term in nature 
and really show up in 2020?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Katy, let me just talk about the new services that we've ann
ounced in 
March, and then also about the timing of how we get to revenue, right? 
We've announced Apple News+, and this is the service that is available for 
consumers right now. We've announced our channel service, which has also 
become available a few week
s ago. The other three services, the card is 
launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in 
the fall. Keep in mind for all these services, there's a trial period up front, 
there's going to be different trial periods, we'll se
e what that what they look 
like. So, the road to monetization takes some time. Obviously, all of them 
will add to our base and will help us with growth rates as we get into next 
year.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question 
please?
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.
 
Krish Sankar
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, on the 
iPhone trade
-
in program, how effective was it and what percentage of the 
iPhone sales
 
came from the trade
-
ins and are there any other geographies 
where you are left to rule it out? Then, I have a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 
Hi, it's Tim. In retail, it was quite successful. We got going in a larger way 
during that quarter, we were pretty much just 
ramping in the previous 
quarter. And trade
-
in as a percentage of their total sales is significant and 
financing is a key element of it. Those two things in the aggregate led the 
combination of retail and online, just short form that is retail Apple Store l
et 
to growth in June trajectory. We are obviously taking those programs and 
advocating those more widely and that is at different levels of 
implementation throughout different geographies. Because we're working 
with our carrier partners on those and retail
 
partners.
 
Krish Sankar
 
Got it. Got it. That's pretty helpful, Tim. And then, a follow
-
up for you, a 
much longer
-
term question. I understand we're in the very early innings of 
the services growth story. Is there a way to think about it down the road, 3 
or 
5 years down the road, would the services growth still be tethered to the 
hardware of the iPhone, or do you think at some point down the road 
services would be independent by itself and not really tied to your hardware 
installed base?
 
Tim Cook
 
Well, there 
are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, 
right? We have other products where people are both purchasing things, 
they're watching Apple TV. We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's 
a series of things that are outside of that. A
nd so we'll see what we do in the 
future. I don't want to really get into that.
 
But, more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, 
the way I see it is, we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever, we've got 
new products on the way,
 
the pipeline is full of great new stuff both on the 
product and the services side. We're very fortunate and work very hard to 
have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of 
switchers. The installed base is growing, hit a new recor
d, that's obviously 
good. And it hit a new record across all geographies and across all 
categories. And so, this is a really good thing.
 
And we've got the Wearables area that is doing extremely well. We stuck 
with that when others perhaps didn't and really
 
put a lot of energy into this 
and a lot of R&D and are in a very good position today to keep playing out 
what's next there.
 
At the same time, on the market side, we have emerging markets where we 
have low penetration. And during the quarter tactically the
 
emerging 
markets had a bit of a rebound. And in fact, on a constant currency basis, 
we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. We still declined on a 
reported basis. India bounced back. During the quarter, we returned to 
growth there. We're very happy
 
with that. We grew in Brazil as well.
 
We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. Luca mentioned 
some of this in his comments and we think that continues to be a big 
opportunity for us. And then, we've got lots of what I would call core 
techn
ology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big 
bets and bet that we have a big future, in addition to the health kinds of 
things that may fall out of the watch. And so hopefully that kind of gives you 
a view over the total.
 
And so, w
e're focusing on products and services and there will be some 
services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period 
sales mostly, very much services are rarely connected on that today or at 
least not a high percentage by any means ther
e. They're more correlated to 
the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are 
there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that 
we have.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Krish. Could we have the next question,
 
please?
 
Operator
 
Next, we will go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Yes. Thank you. Tim, the China trade situation remains sort of fluid over 
here and more recently you asked for some tariff exceptions were not 
granted those. 
How are you thinking about the longer
-
term footprint for 
manufacturing and can you talk about any potential alternatives that you've 
looked at and considered in moving parts of production potentially out of 
China. And I have a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes. I kn
ow there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different 
moves and so forth. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you. 
The way I view this is, the vast majority of our products are kind of made 
everywhere. There's a significant lev
el of content from the United States and 
a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes 
a fair amount. And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain. Largely, I 
think that will carry the day in the future as well.
 
In terms 
of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S., we 
want to continue doing that. And so, we're working and investing currently 
in capacity to do so, because we want to continue to be here. And so that's 
what's behind the exclusions. And so, we
're explaining that and hope for a 
positive outcome.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Okay. Thanks, Tim. And there is, Luca, maybe for you, there's been some 
significant destocking of inventory in the first calendar half of this year in 
iPhone. Can you comment about the broade
r channel inventory levels where 
you are in your typical ranges, especially given the comment around June 
iPhone sales being quite strong and do you expect anything atypical in 
channel inventory dynamics in the September quarter? Thank you.
 
Luca 
Maestri
 
Yes, Wamsi, as you know we're not getting into this topic very much. But, I 
think I can give you some color here. You know that in general, we decrease 
our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. That has been 
traditionally what we
've done. This year, we reduced channel inventory for 
iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total and it's true for 
Greater China as well. So, we feel very good about our channel inventory 
ranges as we get into the September quarter. Hope
 
that helps you with that.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?

Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
 
Jim Suva
 
Thanks very much. The first question is probably to Tim and second one for 
Luca. I wi
ll ask them at the same time, so you can continue which other one 
you want to answer, first or second. While the first one is for Tim, regarding 
the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but 
yet when you look at the iPhone revenue
 
year
-
over
-
year the past several 
quarters have been down. Can you help us bridge the gap of, how is the 
installed base growing? Is it mostly because secondary users are the new 
ones coming into the system as people are holding more phones longer? And 
what 
does that user typically bring in with them or something unique relative 
to what we historically know?
 
And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot and a lot of these 
services are now coming to pass whether it be AppleCare, Apple Cloud, all 
t
hese wearables and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. Are we at a point where 
now a lot of harvesting is going to happen or do you kind of continue this 
relatively same investment that you've been doing for the future strategy. 
Thank you.

Hey, Jim, it's T
im, I'll start with your installed base question. Installed base 
is a function of upgrades and the time between those. It's a function of the 
number of switchers coming into the to the iOS, macOS and so forth 
[indiscernible]. It's a function of the robustn
ess of the secondary market, 
which we think overwhelmingly hits an incremental customer. And it's a 
function still in the emerging markets and somewhat developed markets to a 

There ar
e still quite a few people in the world in that category. And so, the 
reason that the installed base doesn't correlate to the 90
-
day clock is that 
what's happening underneath the numbers is, switchers are still a very key 
piece of what's going on. The seco
ndary market is very key, and we're doing 
programs et cetera to try to increase that, because we think we wind up 
hitting a cost number that we don't hit in another way.
 
And the upgrades where people are holding onto their device a bit longer 
than they wer
e, they're staying in the ecosystem. And then, you have the 
people in the new category as well. And so, that's sort of the equation. I 
don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, 
mathematically, how the installed base is gr
owing in an environment where 
the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90
-
day kind of window.

And Jim, on OpEx, obviously is very important for us to continue to invest in 
the business, particularly on the R&D side, because we will always want
 
to 
bring more innovation into the market. We want to improve the user 
experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. 
So, we will continue to do that. There are some types of investments, of 
course, that are very strategic for u
s and they will have long
-
term 
implications. You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel 
acquisition. Very important strategically for us. It requires upfront 
investment, of course.
 
As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we
 
will continue to 
run our SG&A portion of OpEx tightly. Of course, we'll continue to invest in 
marketing and advertising. We talked about a lot of new services that we are 
launching during the fall and Apple Card next month, obviously they will 
require the
 
appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch 
them to the general public.
 
When you look in total, where we are in terms of our expense to revenue 
ratio for operating expenses, you know, quite well that we are extremely 
competitive relative t
o other tech companies. So, we want to continue to be 
competitive and at the same time we will not under
-
invest in the business.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Samik Chatterje
e with JPMorgan.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start
-
off with the 
announcement at WWDC around the independent App Stores for the Watch 
and the iPad. What level of interest have you seen from developers and how 
are 
they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on 
those App Stores? And how does that help you position wearables more 
firmly into the health and fitness category?
 
Tim Cook
 
We're seeing good interest across virtually everything that we 
announced at 
WWDC. I couldn't be happier with it. The developer tools around ARKit and 
AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of 
interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with 
macOS Catalina, 
which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the 
Mac. We think this is huge and so great for the user experience. And so, you 
look at all of these and all the things that I talked about earlier and I 
couldn't be happier with the reception that we'r
e getting and the work that is 
going on behind the scenes right now for the developers readying their apps 
for the fall.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Got it. If I can just follow
-
up on the China market, one of the things that 
we're looking at is going into the New Yea
r into 2020 there'll be a lot of 5G 
phones launching in that market from the Android players. How do you think 
about the competitive landscape there as you enter next year?
 
Tim Cook
 
We don't comment on future products. With respect to 5G, I think most 
peop
le would tell you, we're in sort of the extremely early innings of it. And 
even more so on a global basis. So, we couldn't be more proud of what our 
lineup is and we're excited about the great pipeline of both hardware and 
software and we wouldn't trade ou
r position for anyone's.

Tim Cook
 
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
This has been an exciting and productive quarter for Apple. In my letter to 
investors at the beginning of January, I w
rote that one of Apple's great 
strengths is our culture of flexibility, adaptability, and creativity. This quarter 
featured some important announcements that speak to the power of our 
commitment to innovation and long
-
term thinking. I'd like to start with 
some 
top
-
line highlights and then move into greater detail with you.
 
I'll get started with financial results. Our revenue was $58 billion toward the 
high end of our guidance range. We see this result as a positive outcome in 
light of ongoing headwinds from
 
weaker foreign currencies relative to the 
U.S. dollar. In constant currency, our year
-
over
-
year revenue performance 
would have been 200 basis points better than our reported results indicate.
 
We had great results in a number of areas across our business. 
It was our 
best quarter ever for Services with revenue reaching $11.5 billion. We had a 
blockbuster quarter for iPad, with revenue up 22% from a year ago. This is 
our highest iPad revenue growth rate in six years. And it was another 
sensational quarter for
 
Wearables with growth near 50%. This business is 
now about the size of a Fortune 200 company, an amazing statistic when 
you consider it's only been four years since we delivered the very first Apple 
Watch. I'll talk more about these categories later.
 
Whil
e we grew year
-
over
-
year in developed markets, and while we had 
record March quarter results in a number of major markets including the 
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, we did experience a 
revenue decline in emerging markets. But we fe
el positive about our 
trajectory. Our year
-
over
-
year revenue performance in Greater China 
improved relative to the December quarter, and we've seen very positive 
customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our 
trade
-
in and financin
g programs in our retail stores, the effects of 
government measures to stimulate the economy, and improved trade dialog 
between the United States and China.
 
Our App Store results are still reflecting the impact of the slowdown in 
regulatory approval in gam
ing apps in China, but we're encouraged by the 
recent increase in the pace of approvals. We believe strongly in our long
-
term opportunity in China, thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented 
developer community, and the country's growing population of te
ch
-
savvy 
consumers who value the very best products and services. For iPhone, while 
our worldwide revenue was down 17% from a year ago, declines were 
significantly smaller in the final weeks of the March quarter.
 
Looking back at the past five months, Novem
ber and December were the 
most challenging, so this is an encouraging trend. We like the direction we're 
headed with iPhone and our goal now is to pick up the pace. Importantly, 
our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our 
geograph
ic segments, and set a new all
-
time record for all major product 
categories. That growing installed base is a reflection of the satisfaction and 
loyalty of our customers, and it's driving our Services business to new 
heights.
 
In fact, we had our best quart
er ever for the App Store, Apple Music cloud 
services, and our App Store search ad business, and we set new March 
quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay transaction 
volume more than doubled year
-
over
-
year, and we're on track to reac
h 10 
billion transactions this calendar year. Apple Pay is now available in 30 
markets, and we expect to be live in 40 markets by the end of the year. 
More and more transit systems are accepting Apple Pay and New York's MTA 
system will begin the rollout in
 
early summer.
 
As we've seen in places like London, Tokyo, and Shanghai, contactless entry 
into transit systems helps to spur broader Apple Pay adoption, and we 
believe this will get even more people using Apple Pay in the United States. 
And Ticketmaster h
as just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay 
for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app, and over 
50 of their entertainment and sporting event venues are launching 
contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority 
of NFL stadiums.
 
Subscriptions are a powerful driver of our Services business. We reached a 
new high of over 390 million paid subscriptions at the end of March, an 
increase of 30 million in the last quarter alone. This was also an incredibly 
important quar
ter for our Services moving forward. In March, we previewed 
a game
-
changing array of new services, each of them rooted in principles 
that are fundamentally Apple. They're easy to use. They feature unmatched 
attention to detail. They put a premium on user p
rivacy and security. 
They're expertly curated, personalized, and ready to be shared by everyone 
in your family.
 
These features aren't just nice to have. They actually help to eliminate the 
boundary between hardware, software, and service, creating a singul
arly 
exceptional experience for our users. First, building on the great momentum 
of Apple News, which is already the number one news app in the United 
States and the United Kingdom, we launched Apple News+. It will bring 
together over 30 popular magazines,
 
leading newspapers, and digital 
publishers into a beautiful, convenient, and curated experience within the 
Apple News app.
 
Apple News+ builds on our commitment to supporting quality journalism 
from trusted sources, while providing the best magazine and ne
ws reading 
experience ever for mobile devices. Advancing our vision to replace the 
wallet, we announced Apple Card built on principles Apple stands for like 
transparency, simplicity, and privacy. Apple Card is integrated into the 
Wallet app and delivers al
l new experiences that only Apple can provide 
integrating our hardware, software and services in an elegant solution that 
places the customer at the center. It's the first card to encourage you to pay 
less interest, eliminate fees, and give you daily cash 
on all your purchases 
and customer interest to date has been terrific.
 
We also previewed Apple Arcade, the world's first game subscription service 
for mobile, desktop, and the living room. With over 100 new games, all with 
no ads or ad tracking, no additio
nal purchases, and respect for user privacy, 
we've created a service for players of all ages, kids to teens to adults and 
one that families can enjoy together. The App Store is already the world's 
biggest gaming platform and we think Apple Arcade is a grea
t way to 
unleash the creativity of the game developer community with a collection of 
new games not available on any other mobile platform or in any other 
subscription service. We can't wait for our customers to experience it for 
themselves beginning this f
all.
 
We were thrilled to provide a peek at what's new for TV. Beginning in mid
-
May, the all
-
new Apple TV app will bring together the different ways to 
discover and watch shows, movies, sports news, and more in one app across 
iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, sm
art TVs, and streaming devices. And users 
can subscribe to and watch new Apple TV channels like HBO Showtime and 
Starz paying only for services they want all on
-
demand available on and 
offline. And coming this fall, Apple TV+ will be the new home for the w
orld's 
most creative storytellers featuring exclusive original shows, movies, and 
documentaries.
 
We also had several major product introductions during the quarter. We 
launched a new, more powerful iMac with dramatic increases in both 
compute and graphics 
performance, making it a great update for consumers 
and pros alike. For our Mac business overall, we faced some processor 
constraints in the March quarter leading to a 5% revenue decline compared 
to last year, but we believe that our Mac revenue would have
 
been up 
compared to last year without those constraints and don't believe this 
challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results.
 
For iPad, we were very happy to return to growth in Greater China while 
generating strong double
-
digit growth in eac
h of our other geographic 
segments. Our great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer 
response to iPad Pro. Late in the quarter, we launched an all
-
new iPad Air 
with an ultra
-
thin design, Apple Pencil support, and high
-
end performance 
powered
 
by Apple's A12 Bionic chip.
 
In addition, we introduced a new iPad Mini, a major upgrade for iPad fans 
who love an ultra
-
portable design and like the new iPad Air, it delivers the 
power of the A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil. Last month, we 
introdu
ced new AirPods, the second generation of the world's most popular 
wireless headphones and demand has been incredible. This is nothing less 
than a cultural phenomenon.
 
With the new Apple
-
designed H1 chip, the new AirPods deliver faster connect 
times, more 
talk time, and the convenience of hands
-
free Hey Siri. Our retail 
and online stores continue to be a key point of innovation. As we mentioned 
in January, we've been working on an initiative to make it simple to trade in 
a phone in our store, finance the pu
rchase over time, and get help 
transferring data from the old phone to the new phone.
 
As part of this initiative, we rolled out new trade
-
in and financing programs 
in the U.S., China, the U.K., Spain, Italy, and Australia. The results have 
been striking. A
cross our stores, we had an all
-
time record response to our 
trade
-
in programs and with more than 4 times the trade
-
in volume of our 
March quarter a year ago.
 
With each passing quarter, we're more inspired by the impact our products 
are having on people's f
itness and health. This quarter, we brought the ECG 
app on Apple Watch Series 4 to Hong Kong and 19 European countries 
including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.
 
Just like when the ECG app launched in the United States, there's hardly a 
day 
that goes by that I don't get a letter or an e
-
mail from a customer in 
one of these countries talking about how this feature has significantly 
changed their life. We believe we're really just beginning to tap into what we 
can do to help our users actively 
manage their health and well
-
being.
 
For example, last month Stanford Medicine reported results of the Apple 
Heart Study, the largest study ever of its kind, which enrolled over 400,000 
participants from all 50 states in a span of only eight months. And hun
dreds 
of institutions are now supporting health records on iPhone with recent 
additions including Michigan Medicine and UT Health Austin.
 
In February, we announced that we are working with the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs to make health records on i
Phone available to veterans. This 
will be the first record sharing platform of its kind available to the VA, which 
is the largest medical system in the U.S. providing service to more than nine 
million veterans across more than 1,200 facilities.
 
Apple's inn
ovation extends beyond the impact we have in the lives of our 
customers to the impact we leave on the world around us. We recently 
marked Earth Day with several major announcements about our efforts to 
leave the world better than we found it. We've complet
ed the allocation of 
our $2.5 billion green bond proceeds across 40 environmental initiatives 
around the world to projects ranging from solar power generation to water 
conservation to development of custom alloys for our products made from 
100% recycled al
uminum.
 
We've announced a major expansion of our recycling programs, including 
quadrupling the number of locations where U.S. customers can send their 
iPhones to be disassembled by Daisy, our recycling robot. Each Daisy can 
now disassemble 1.2 million devi
ces per year, allowing recovered materials 
to be recycled into the manufacturing process. And we partnered with a 
record number of our suppliers to follow our lead and transition to 100% 
clean energy. With the help of these 44 suppliers, we will exceed our
 
goal of 
bringing four gigawatts of renewable energy into our supply chain by 2020 
with over one additional gigawatt projected within that time frame.
 
In the last calendar year alone, the partners that have joined this effort have 
generated enough clean en
ergy to power over 600,000 homes in the United 
States. We're very proud of the progress that we and our partners are 
making, and hope our actions will inspire other businesses to do what they 
can to protect the world that we share.
 
We are as excited as eve
r about our great pipeline of hardware, software 
and services and we're looking forward to sharing more information about 
the future of our four software platforms at our Worldwide Developer 
Conference now less than five weeks from now. Everyone here is ha
rd at 
work to prepare for WWDC, and it's always a privilege to get to share the 
future of our platforms with the community of world changing developers 
who bring it to life. You are not going to want to miss this one.
 
We're in the fortunate position of gen
erating more cash than we need to run 
our business and invest confidently in our future, so today we're announcing 
the latest update to our capital return program including an increase to our 
share repurchase authorization and our quarterly dividend.
 
For m
ore details on that and our March quarter results, I'll turn the call over 
to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue in the March quarter 
was $58 billion near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 
days ago and
 
down 5% from last year. Our revenue decline reflects 200 
basis points of negative foreign exchange, due to the strength of the U.S. 
dollar. Overall, products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, 
while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all
-
time
 
record.
 
We also set a new March quarter record for Wearables Home and 
Accessories, and we recorded our best iPad growth rate in six years. 
Company gross margin was 37.6% in line with our guidance. Products gross 
margin was 31.2% down about 310 basis point
s sequentially due to the 
seasonal loss of leverage and headwinds from foreign exchange.
 
Services gross margin was 63.8%, up 100 basis points sequentially due to a 
different mix and leverage from higher revenue. Net income was $11.6 
billion. Diluted earnin
gs per share were $2.46 and operating cash flow was 
$11.2 billion.
 
Let me provide more color for our various revenue categories. iPhone 
revenue was $31.1 billion. We're seeing positive customer response to 
recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets
, as well as enhancements 
to our trade
-
in and financing programs. And our year
-
over
-
year performance 
improved relative to our December quarter results in Greater China, in the 
Americas and in Japan.
 
Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all
-
tim
e high at the end of 
March. This growing installed base reflects the industry leading satisfaction 
and loyalty of our customers. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 
Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS 
Max combi
ned. And among business buyers, who plan to purchase 
smartphones in the June quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones.
 
Turning to Services. As Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 
billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year. We generate
d double
-
digit revenue growth across the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, 
AppleCare, Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. And we set all
-
time services revenue records in four of our five geographic segments. We're 
very happy with this per
formance. As you can see from our new disclosures, 
Services accounted for 20% of our March quarter revenue and about one
-
third of our gross profit dollars.
 
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of 
transacting accounts on our di
gital content stores reached another new all
-
time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts, also setting 
a new all
-
time record and growing by strong double
-
digits over last year. 
And we now have over 390 million paid subscriptions across ou
r Services 
portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus just 12 months ago. All 
subscription categories are growing strong double
-
digits and as we 
mentioned a quarter ago, we expect the number of paid subscriptions to 
surpass 0.5 billion during 2020.
 
On th
e App Store, our subscription business is extremely diversified and is 
growing strongly around the world. In fact, the number of paid third
-
party 
subscriptions increased by over 40% compared to last year in each of our 
geographic segments. And across all t
hird
-
party subscription apps, the 
largest accounted for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.5 billion compared to 
$5.8 billion a year ago with the decline driven primarily by processor 
constraint on
 
certain popular models. In spite of this challenge, we 
generated double
-
digit Mac revenue growth in Japan and Korea setting new 
all
-
time Mac revenue records in both markets. On a global basis, nearly half 
of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarte
r were new to Mac and 
the active installed base of Macs reached a new all
-
time high.
 
We had great results for iPad with $4.9 billion in revenue and growth 
accelerating from the December quarter to 22%. iPad revenue grew in all 
five of our geographic segmen
ts, with a return to growth in Greater China 
and strong double
-
digit growth in all other segments. We had our best March 
quarter ever for iPad in Japan, and we were especially pleased by 
performance in Korea, Thailand and Mexico where revenue more than 
dou
bled over last year.
 
In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the March 
quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a 
new all
-
time high.
 
iPad revenue growth has been fueled primarily by the great customer 
re
sponse to our new iPad Pros. These completely redesigned iPads with full
-
screen Liquid Retina display, Face ID, powerful A12X Bionic chip with Neural 
Engine and support for the new Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard make iPad 
Pro the perfect PC laptop replace
ment for both consumers and professionals.
 
The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer 
satisfaction rating for iPad overall. Among customers who plan to purchase 
tablets 77% of consumers and 75% of businesses plan to purchase iPads.
 
W
earables Home and Accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue 
record of $5.1 billion fueled primarily by the strong performance of our 
Wearables business, which grew close to 50%. Within this category, Apple 
Watch is the best
-
selling and most loved
 
smartwatch in the world and 
produced its best results ever for a non
-
holiday quarter. It's reaching many 
new customers with three quarters of purchases going to customers who 
have never owned an Apple Watch before. Interest in AirPods has been off 
the cha
rts and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible customer 
demand.
 
Turning to our retail and online stores. We generated very strong double
-
digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We also announced 50 new 
Today at Apple sessions during the
 
quarter in three new and expanded 
formats Skills, Walks and Labs free at our stores around the world. We're 
making important progress in the enterprise market, helping transform 
major industries. We're building on Apple's leading position in key functiona
l 
areas to expand our reach and share within large accounts.
 
Aviation is a strong example of this strategy at work. Across 450 airlines, 
iPad is overwhelmingly the preferred solution for the pilot's electronic flight 
bag. We've been making great progress e
xpanding Apple's footprint beyond 
the cockpit into the cabin, where more than half of the top 50 airlines have 
now implemented iOS to enhance the guest experience as well as enable a 
new use case with mobile point
-
of
-
sale.
 
We're also seeing traction with o
ther mission
-
critical airline functions in 
ground operations and flight maintenance. For example, one of the largest 
airlines in the world tells us that the adoption of iPad has cut maintenance 
delays in half. Apple services are also making their way onboa
rd, including 
growing adoption of Apple Pay for food and beverage purchases and in
-
flight 
access to Apple Music.
 
We're also seeing significant iOS traction with large enterprise platforms 
which are the face of complex back
-
end systems to tens of millions o
f 
employees around the world. The end user employee experience is vital to 
engagement and productivity and with increasing mobility of today's modern 
workforce, those experiences are best on native iOS applications.
 
We see great momentum through the 
growing number of iOS SDKs being 
delivered by the world's largest enterprise platforms. For instance, SAP's 
SDK for iOS continues to gain strong traction with their customers, growing 
by more than 40% in the last six months. And this past quarter Salesforc
e 
released its SDK enabling developers to build native iOS applications directly 
on top of the Salesforce platform.
 
And finally, our enterprise channels continue to build momentum. In 
February, our Apple at Work initiative was launched with AT&T. This 
exte
nsion to our ongoing collaboration with AT&T will make it easy for more 
customers to choose the best Apple products for their needs in the 
enterprise and modernize their business. AT&T will enable business services 
for Apple products to help companies with
 
their IT strategy, including device 
management, security, productivity and collaboration.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $225 
billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We also had $101 billion in term 
debt and $12 billi
on in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position 
of almost $113 billion.
 
As a result, we are in a very strong position that allows us to invest 
confidently in all areas of the business, while continuing to return value to 
our shareholders. Just 
last year, we announced a commitment to contribute 
more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years, 
including the creation of 20,000 jobs.
 
More recently, we've announced a major expansion in Austin Texas and in 
other cities across the c
ountry. All these efforts are essential investments to 
make sure that we're incorporating innovative ideas and top talent wherever 
they emerge.
 
As we execute those initiatives, we are also able to return over $27 billion to 
investors during the March quart
er. We began a $12 billion accelerated 
share repurchase program in February, resulting in the initial delivery and 
retirement of 55.1 million shares. We also repurchased 71.7 million Apple 
shares for $12 billion through open market transactions and we paid
 
$3.4 
billion in dividends and equivalents.
 
Our priorities for cash have not changed over the years. Most importantly, 
we always want to maintain the cash we need to run our business, maintain 
strategic flexibility, and invest in our future. We're well on 
our way towards 
meeting the investment projections we laid out early last year. We also want 
to work towards a more optimal capital structure and as we said before, it is 
our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time.
 
Given our confidence in Appl
e's future and the value we see in our stock, our 
Board has authorized an additional $75 billion for share repurchases. And 
because we know many of our investors value income, we're also raising our 
quarterly dividend for the seventh time in less than seve
n years to $0.77, an 
increase of about 5% from the previous amount.
 
We paid over $14 billion in dividends and equivalents over the last four 
quarters alone, making us one of the largest dividend payers in the world. 
Going forward, we continue to plan for a
nnual increases in dividends per 
share.
 
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52
.5 
billion and $54.5 billion. This guidance range comprehends 300 basis points 
of negative foreign exchange impact year
-
over
-
year. Also as a reminder, in 
the June quarter last year, our Services revenue included a favorable $236 
million one
-
time item in co
nnection with the final resolution of various 
lawsuits.
 
We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to 
be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 
million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Als
o reflecting the 
approved increase, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash 
dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on May 16, 2019 to 
shareholders of record as of May 15, 2019.
 
With that, I would like to open the call to questions.
 
N
ancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. 
Operator, may we have the first question please?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross 
Research.
 
Shanno
n Cross
 
Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit more 
about what you're seeing in China? Clearly, it looks like things are improving 
sequentially. You also mentioned that last few weeks of the quarter, were 
stabilizing in emergin
g markets, I believe. So what are customers saying 
there and what are your partners saying in China? And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Shannon. We're seeing 
--
 
in the iPhone 
space, we saw a better year
-
over
-
year performan
ce in the last weeks of the 
quarter as compared to the full quarter or November and December, which 
was sort of a 
--
 
it appears to be the trough. I think there's a set of reasons 
for this.
 
One, we made some price adjustments essentially backing out the wea
ker 
currency effect and then some. There's stimulus programs that the 
government has executed including 
--
 
and this happened in early April, VAT 
being reduced from 16% to 13%, so they've been aggressive in the stimulus 
side.
 
Three, our trade
-
in and financi

retail stores have been very well received there, and I'm happy with the 
results to date there. And then four, there's an improved trade dialog 
between the U.S. and China. And from our point of view, this has affec
ted 
consumer confidence on the ground there in a positive way. And so, I think 
it's a set of all of these things and we certainly feel a lot better than we did

Shannon Cross
 
Great. Thank you. And then, I'm sure you're probably expecting a ques
tion 
on Qualcomm settlement. So what would you like to say on this settlement? 
How are you thinking about your component providers going forward? And 
how should we think about this with regard to 
--
 
I don't know your 
development plans in the future because
 
I'm sure you're not going to talk 
about when you're going to do 5G, but clearly it helps that path. Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah. Thank you, Shannon. We're glad to put the litigation behind us, and all 
the litigation around the world has been dismissed and se
ttled. We're very 
happy to have a multi
-
year supply agreement, and we're happy that we 
have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was I know 
important for both companies, and so we feel good about the resolution.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, 
Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you talked about China responding 
well to these pricing actions that you've 
taken in that market. Do any of 
those learnings kind of carry through into how you decide pricing in the 
remaining emerging markets, like India, et cetera as you get ready for the 
next product cycle?
 
Tim Cook
 
We have made some adjustments in India, and we'
ve seen preliminarily 
some better results there. Everything that we do does advise everything we 
do in the future, so we try to learn the best we can and hold [ph] that into 
our thinking, and we'll obviously do that with this as well.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Than
k you. I just had a quick follow
-
up for Luca on the Services side. Luca, 
we see that you're guiding to higher operating expenses quarter
-
on
-
quarter. 
How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that 
you're planning to launch later i
n the year?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yeah. Of course, we are supporting both our products and services business 
and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters. 
Clearly as we add new services, we will need to make the necessary 
investments to su
pport them.
 
Our Services business has multiple streams. In total, it is accretive to 
company gross margins. You've seen the latest 
--
 
we're running services 
margins at over 60%. So, it's a very important business for us in many ways 
for our ecosystem and f
or our ability to monetize it. And so, clearly we will 
make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are 
successful, and we're really encouraged by the level of customer response 
that we received so far in anticipation for the launch o
f these services.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Samik. Can we have the next question please.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you. Luca, if I look back over the past five years, June quarter 
revenue t
ypically declines about 15% from the March quarter. You're guiding 
to an 8% drop this year. So can you just talk about, which regions or 
product segments you think can outperform that typical seasonality?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, Katy. And keep in mind by the way
, we are reporting this guidance 
including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, so 
actually in constant currency the numbers would be even stronger.
 
At the product category level, we expect that we will continue to have strong 
revenue g
rowth from the non
-
iPhone categories as we've had for the first 
half of our fiscal year. We're also expecting a relative improvement in our 
iPhone performance on a year
-
over
-
year basis in Q3 versus the first half.
 
As Tim said, March was the strongest month
 
of the quarter on a year
-
over
-
year basis and so this has given the confidence to provide the guidance that 
you've seen. Geographically, of course, as you've seen from our results for 
the March quarter, China is the geo where we found some challenges, but 
we believe the trajectory should improve over time.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you. And then just as a follow
-
up, Shannon said you're not going to 
talk specifics around the timing of the 5G phone, but Tim maybe you can 
talk about how the company approaches a new t
echnology like this given the 
higher cost but also potentially significant benefit, how you think about the 
right timing for coming to market with a product, with those characteristics? 
And then just generally how meaningful you think 5G is as a demand dri
ver 
for upgrades in your iPhone installed base? Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Katy, this is one that I'm going to largely punt on as you would probably 
guess. We look at a lot of things on the different technologies and try to look 
at the 
--
 
and select the right tim
e that things come together and get those 
into products as soon as we can. And the 
--
 
certainly from a cost point of 
view there has been 
--
 
the technologies have had cost pressure over the last 
couple of years or so.
 
On the flip side of that there's a numb
er of things in the commodity markets 
going in the other direction at the moment like DRAM and NAND. And so it's 
difficult to project what happens next, but it's the aggregate of all of it that 
really matters from a price point of view.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Katy. So we have the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Jim Suva from Citi has our next question.
 
Jim Suva
 
Thank you very much. A topic that's probably split or shared by both Tim 
and Luca on a response, but I'll ask the question and you can decide
 
how to 
divide it up.
 
In your opening remarks, Tim, you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments 
that you made in some of the markets and then Luca talked also about the 
strength of the trade
-
in program or maybe it was Tim also. Can you help us 
understand abo
ut what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about 
pricing and the trade
-
in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS 
and margins and things? Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah. Jim, in the opening remarks I was really talking about China 
specificall
y. And I mentioned four things that I believe are responsible for 
the better year
-
over
-
year performance in the Q2 relative to Q1 and also the 
final weeks of March being better than the Q2 average. And those four are 
the price reductions, but that's one of 
them. But there are three others and 
one of the others is the trade
-
in and financing programs that we instituted in 
our retail stores.
 
Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the 
--
 
many, many people do want to trade
-
in thei
r current phone. It does 
--
 
from 
a customer user point of view the trade
-
in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a 
way to offset the device cost itself. And many people in literally every 
market that we've tried this in, there is a reasonable number of peopl
e that 
want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once. 
And so, it's a little different in each market in terms of what the elasticity is, 
but you can bet that we're learning quickly on all of those.
 
The other two items that are n
ot insignificant in China that I don't want to 
lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on 
the consumer. And the one that I got much visibility in 
--
 
that happened in 
early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it'
s a very 
aggressive move. But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely 
have an effect to the consumer level.
 
And then finally 
--
 
and this is not to be under weighted either 
--
 
I think the 
improved trade dialogue between the countries affects c
onsumer confidence 
in a positive way. And so, I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things.
 
Luca Maestri
 
And Jim, if I may add on the gross margin level as we look at pricing 
actions, of course, anytime you do a pricing action it is gross margin 
per
centage diluted. But what really matters to us and what we look at 
--
 
when we look at the elasticity of these programs is to see the impact on our 
gross margin dollars. And what 
--
 
the experience that we've had in a few of 
these emerging markets has been p
ositive in that respect and so that's what 
we think matters the most really.
 
Jim Suva
 
Thank you so much, gentlemen.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Jim. We have the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America M
errill 
Lynch.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Hi. Yes. Thank you. Tim, you shared a lot of color around trade
-
ins, but I 
was also hoping maybe you can characterize what sort of dynamics you're 
seeing across your installed base on these trade
-
ins. What type of devices 
are bein
g traded in? Is the profile of someone who has a really old iPhone? 
Or are you seeing folks that have newer iPhones trading in? And what sort of 
incentives are you providing beyond sort of the financing to drive that? And 
do you see this as something that 
can accelerate replacement cycles here 
over the next year or so? And I have a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 
We're 
--
 
actually the product that's being traded in is all over the place, to 
be honest. It's 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and then fewer 8 and 8 Plus. 
But there's some of each of those and so you get customers that are on the 
two
-
year cycle and customers 
--
 
some customers on the one
-
year cycle and 
then customers as well on the three and four
-
year cycles. And so it's really 
all over the place.
 
In terms of
 
the incentives we're offering currently in our retail stores a 
trade
-
in value that has 
--
 
that is more than the sort of the blue book of the 
device if you will for lack of a better description. And so we have topped 
those up to provide an extra benefit to
 
the user.
 
The installments are different in each geography. I would say that at the 
moment the geography that is doing the best in installments would be 
China. And we have a bit of a unique offering there I think versus the 
--
 
versus what you can get in t
he regular market and so that probably further 
helps there. And so you can bet that we're learning on each of these finding 
the parts that the user likes the most.
 
I think the key is we're trying to build a 
--
 
build something into the 
consumer mindset that
 
it's good for the environment and good for them to 
trade in their current device on a new device. And we do our best of getting 
the current device to someone else that can use that or in some cases if the 
product is at an end of life we are recycling the 
parts on it to make sure that 
it can carry on in another form.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Thanks for the color Tim. And as my follow
-
up Luca can you just clarify if the 
settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to 
your gross margins in the near
-
term? And does your guidance contemplate 
incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin 
headwinds? Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
As Tim has explained we've reach this comprehensive agreement with 
Qualcomm. As part of this we have 
agreed that we're not going to share the 
financial terms of the agreement, so we plan to honor that. What you see in 
our gross margin guidance for the June quarter we guided 37% to 38% fully 
comprehends the outcome of the agreement with Qualcomm.
 
Nancy Pax
ton
 
Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray has our next question.
 
Mike Olson
 
Thanks for taking my question. So, you have more than 1.4 billion active 
devices and at your event you announced services
 
that leverage that 
installed base. And you have obviously a remarkable position with kind of 
this Trojan horse of devices out in so many households.
 
So, I guess, the question is and I know some of these services aren't even 
live yet but should we expect a
 
continuation of the building out of new 
services categories like what we saw at the March event? Is there a pipeline 
of new services in the works? Or have we kind of seen what we're likely to 
see on that front for the near to intermediate term? And then I
 
have a 
follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes, I wouldn't want to get into announcing things on the call, but obviously, 
we're always working on new things. And 
--
 
but we're right now we're really 
focused on getting these four out there. We have the News+ in the 
market 
today. We'll have the Apple Arcade and the Apple TV+ products in the 
market in the fall and Apple Card will go out in the summer timeframe. And 
so we've got lots in front of us and we're very excited about getting these 
out there.
 
Mike Olson
 
Right. 
And then you mentioned the App Store search ad business a couple of 
times in the prepared remarks. Is that reaching a point where it's become 
material and maybe moving the needle for overall services revenue? Or is 
there anything you can quantify related t
o that? I also imagine that this is a 
high
-
margin business at least maybe higher than the overall Services margin 
but wondering if you can confirm if that's the case or not. Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
It's growing very, very fast Mike. I think it was up around 70% o
ver the 
previous year. We're expanding into new geographies as well and we still 
have more geographies out there that we think can move the dial further. 
So, it is a 
--
 
it's definitely a business that is big and getting bigger.
 
A 

 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, 
Mike. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets.
 
Q 

 
Louis Miscioscia
 
Okay and thank you for taking my question. Tim, when you look at the four 
things that you have announced. A
nd I realize they have different dates 
when they're coming out but, which ones would you say over the next 12 
months has the most potential to help your Services line? And then maybe, 
which one has the best long
-
term potential? And then, I have a quick fol
low
-
up.
 
A 

 
Tim Cook
 
We're going to wait until we get these things out. And what I can tell you 
right now is that the 
--
 
we're taking sort of consumer interest on the Apple 
Card and there's been a significant level of interest on that and we're 
excited. As
 
you know the 
--
 
gaming is the top category on the App Store.
 
And so the Apple Arcade will serve some of that market. And it serves it with 
a different kind of game, which we think will be great for developers and 
great for users. The TV+ product plays in 
a market where it's 
--
 
there's a 
huge move from the cable bundle to over the top.
 
We think that most users are going to get multiple over
-
the
-
top products. 
And we're going to do our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ product 
should be one of them.
 
An
d then, we're working very hard to get everyone to give Apple News+ a 
look. Because we think it's a very unique product. And I love magazines. 
And we have really wanted to support the publishers.
 
And so, we're working very hard to 
--
 
at the 
--
 
but at the v
ery beginning of 

 
Q 

 
Louis Miscioscia
 
Okay, great.
 
A 

 
Tim Cook
 

it.
 
Q 

 
Louis Miscioscia
 
Great.
 
A 

 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah, these aren't 
hobbies.
 
Q 

 
Louis Miscioscia
 
Okay. A quick follow
-
up on India, obviously market share there is well below 
China. I believe you're looking to start manufacturing there. But what's the 
-
-
 
obviously the potential could be huge but the market already seems to
 
be 
pretty dominated on the Android side, so maybe if you could just talk about 
trying to really aggressively ramp up share there. Thank you.
 
A 

 
Tim Cook
 
I think India is a very important market in the long
-
term. It's a challenging 
market in the short
-
ter
m. But we're learning a lot. We have started 
manufacturing there which is very important to be able to serve the market 
in a reasonable way. And we're growing that capability there.
 
And we would like to place retail stores there. And we're working with the
 
government to seek approval to do that. And so, we plan on going in there 
with sort of all of our might.
 
We've opened a developer, accelerator there, which we're very happy with 
some of the things coming out of there. It's a long
-
term play. It's not 
somet
hing that's going to be on overnight huge business. But I think the 
growth potential is phenomenal.
 
It doesn't bother me that it's primarily Android business at the moment 
because that just means there's a lot of opportunity there.

Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. As Tim mentioned, we just 
completed another outstanding quarter. Revenue for the March
 
quarter was 
$58 billion, an increase of $12.4 billion or 27% year over year.
 
Growth was driven primarily by the very strong performance of iPhone and 
the continued strength of the App Store and Mac sales. We achieved these 
terrific results despite growing
 
foreign exchange headwinds.
 
Our performance was particularly impressive in our Greater China and rest 
of Asia Pacific segments. In Greater China, we established an all
-
time 
quarterly record for revenue, which grew 71% year over year, to $16.8 
billion.
 
Gro
ss margin was 40.8%, ahead of our expectations, mainly due to stronger 
than expected iPhone results. Operating margin was 31.5% of revenue and 
net income was $13.6 billion, a new Q2 record.
 
Diluted earnings per share were $2.33, a 40% year over year increa
se, and 
cash flow from operations was $19.1 billion, also a new March quarter 
record. For details by product, I will start with iPhone.
 
We sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 40% year over 
year growth and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 plus h
as remained incredibly 
strong. IPhone sales more than doubled in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and 
Vietnam, and they were up 80% or more in several other markets including 
Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Turkey.
 
The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 plus combined with
 
the popularity of 
higher capacity offerings led to iPhone ASPs of $659, an increase of $62 year 
over year, despite the very significant foreign exchange headwinds I already 
mentioned.
 
We increased iPhone channel inventory by 1 million units during the qua
rter, 
which allowed us to get into the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks 
of channel inventory.
 

10% year over year growth, which is particularly impressive in the context
 

was led by portables and spurred by the updates to MacBook Air and 
MacBook Pro in March. We ended the quarter within our 4 to 5 week target 
range for Mac channel inventory.
 
Turning 
to iPad, we sold 12.6 million, compared to 16.4 million in the year 
ago quarter. iPad sellthrough was 13.7 million, as we reduced channel 
inventory by about 1.1 million units, coming off the holiday quarter. This left 
us within our 5 to 7 week target range
 
of iPad channel inventory.
 
We set a new March quarter record for iPad sales in Japan, and an all
-
time 
record for iPad sales in China, but performance in other markets was more 
muted during the quarter. iPad turns five years old this month, and in every 
ye
ar since its introduction, it has been the number one tablet in sales, in 
quantity and quality of tablet apps, in usage, and most importantly, in 
customer satisfaction. And based on the latest data from NPD, iPad 
maintains a very strong leadership share in
 
all the price bands where we 
compete.
 
iPad has also consistently been the number one tablet in enterprise. A recent 
Changewave survey found that among corporate buyers planning to buy 
tablets in the next six months, 77% plan to purchase iPads. In fact, we
 
are 
seeing very high interest from companies who want to use iPads to 
transform how work gets done.
 
The vast majority of the app opportunities that have been identified as part 
of the Apple and IBM partnership are specifically for iPad. In addition to IBM
, 
we working closely with more than two dozen other leading business 
software and solution providers including Box, Docusign, Microstrategy, 
Revel, and ServiceMax to bring a broad range of innovative mobile solutions 
to more customers on iPad.
 
Turning to s
ervices, revenue grew to a new all
-
time record of $5 billion, an 
increase of 9% year over year. The growth was led by the App Store, which 
remains incredibly popular with our customers around the world, with 
revenue up 29% in the March quarter. According t
o App Annie, the App 
Store generated 70% more global revenue in the March quarter than Google 
Play, up from a 60% lead in the September quarter.
 
Traffic to our retail and online stores was excellent, with a 22% year over 
year increase in customer visits. W

retail store expansion in Greater China, where we added six new stores in 

to have 40 stores open in Greater China by the middle of next y
ear.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $193.5 
billion in cash, plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $15.6 
billion. Over $171 billion of this cash was offshore. In the March quarter, we 
issued 6.5 billion U.S. d
ollar denominated notes and 1.3 billion Swiss franc 
denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base.
 

We spent $7 billion to repurchase 56.4 million A
pple shares through open 
market transactions, paid $2.7 billion in dividends and equivalents, and 
utilized about $100 million to [net share] settle vesting employee RSUs. We 
also retired an additional 13.3 million shares during the quarter, with the 
conclu
sion of the accelerated share repurchase program we launched last 
August.
 

taken action on over $112 billion of our $130 billion program, including $80 
billion in share repurchases at a
n average price of $85.
 


the key factor driving our investments and our capital allocation decisions.
 

to review capital allocation regularly, and we solicit input on our program 
from a broad base of shareholders. This process allows us to be thoughtful 
about the size, the mix, and the 
pace of the program. We very much 
appreciate all the input that many shareholders have provided us.
 
We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant 
capital to shareholders. We first announced our capital return program three
 


expanding its size by the largest amount yet and extending its duration.
 
The existing program was set to co
nclude at the end of this calendar year, 


expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confid
ence 
in the future of Apple and the value we see in our stock.
 
The board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $50 billion, 
raising it from the current $90 billion to $140 billion. We will also continue to 
net share settle vesting employee re
stricted stock units.
 
We also understand that the dividend is very important to many of our 

quarterly dividend will grow from $0.47 per share to $0.52 per share, an 
increase of
 
11%. This effective with our next dividend, which the board has 
declared today and is payable on May 14, 2015 to shareholders of record as 
of May 11, 2015.
 
We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value 
income, and we continue t
o plan for annual dividend increases going 

be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, the size of our 
revised capital return program will increase by over 50%, fr
om 
approximately $130 billion to $200 billion.
 

U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation, and borrowing from both 
domestic and international debt markets. And we plan to provide
 
the next 
update on our program at about this time next year.
 

which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expec
t revenue to be between $46 billion 
and $48 billion, compared to $37.4 billion in the year ago quarter. We 
expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect opex to 
be between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion. We expect YNE to be about $350 
milli
on and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.

[Operator instructions.] Your first question will come from Bill Schultz, 
Goldman Sachs.
 
Q 

 
Bill Schultz
 
When we look at the effect of currency on your gross profit, which I think 
was far less than anyone anticipated, have you 
be able to reduce some of 
the pressure by adjusting the terms of your suppliers? Or is that something 
we should expect to see more of as you progress through the year?
 
A 

 
Luca Maestri
 


we look at this on a sequential basis. And I mentioned during the call in 
January that we were expecting FX to have a negative impact on a 
sequential basis of about 100 basis points
 
after the effect of the hedges.
 
And that is exactly what happened in our actual results. So that was pretty 
much in line with what we were anticipating. Of course, we expect this 
headwind to continue. And on a sequential basis, when we look into the June 
quarter, we expect to see another 40 basis points of negative impact from 
currency.
 

dealing with them in many ways. We are looking at, in some cases, at the 
potential to increase pr

cost structure, and we try to remain as competitive as possible.
 

March quarter, and we feel very good about the guidance that w
e provided, 
given the severity of the impact.
 
Q 

 
Bill Schultz
 
And then as a follow up, obviously, I guess one of the incremental tailwinds 
to gross margin continues to be the iPhone upside relative to expectations. 
Can you give us a bit more color on the 
dynamics of the customer mix for 

rate so far, but if you could just give us a bit more color, as we had last 
quarter, on folks that are new to iPhone, Android switchers, versus 
replacem
ents?
 
A 

 
Tim Cook
 
Bill, we continue to see a higher rate of switchers than we have seen in 

to see a reasonable percentage of first time buyers, particularly in some of 
the emergi
ng markets. And if you look at emerging markets in general, I 
think Luca covered some of this, the revenue from emerging markets, just 
for the March quarter, was up 58% year on year. And a big piece of what is 
driving that is iPhone. Obviously, those resul
ts would have been higher 
without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.

initially anticipated.

To give you a comparison, when we launched the iPhone, we had about 500 
apps that were ready. When we launched iPad, we had about a thousand. 
And so our internal goal was to be able to beat th
e thousand level, and we 
thought it would be great if we were able to do that by a little bit. And as I 
mentioned before, we now have over 3,500 apps in the App Store for the 
watch.

combined all these factors, that is the reason why you see these research 
and development increases yea

core of the company. Innovation is the core of the company.
 

two quarters, the first half of 2015, our revenue growth has been higher

thoughts on what that would mean or could mean for market share over the 
next few quarters, and kind of I guess t
he sustainability of the 6 cycle? And 
then second question, for Luca, in terms of any thoughts on what the margin 
impact from the watch is that ramps over the next couple of years?
 
Tim Cook
 
Gene, if you look at the overall worldwide, we grew iPhone 40%. An

estimate of the market for last quarter is a 16%, so we grew two and a half 
times. And if you kind of look through at the different countries, in almost 
every country, we grew at a multiple of the market.
 
And as I mentioned before, in emerging mark
ets, we did extremely well. And 
so I feel really good about where we are, and you can hopefully tell with the 

quarter as well.
 

leased, in addition to 


numbers not to like.
 
Luca Maestri
 
And Gene, let me take your question on 

you know, this is the period that we provide guidance for. And we guided to 
38.5% to 39.5%, which is slightly down versus our performance in Q2. And 

everage from 
the sequential decline in revenue. This is typical of our seasonality.
 


launching the Apple Watch. Apple
 

brand new category with a lot of new features, a lot of new, innovative 
technologies. And Apple Watch margins will be lower than company average.
 
Gene Munster
 
One maybe quick follow up, Tim, in terms of the base
 
of iPhones that have 
upgraded. I think you provided a number last quarter on that. Is there any 
update to that metric?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah, sure. Our current estimate is that about 20% of the active installed 
base has upgraded to a 6 or 6 plus. And so as I look
 
at that number, that 

inviting over as many switchers as we can. So between both of those and 
the first time buyers as well, it seems really, really good right now.

relative to other product launches, where your commentary around demand 
was characterized by superlative after superlative, that assessment feels 
very 
modest.
 
And part of the reason that I ask is A) are we reading you right in terms of 
that, but if we look at consensus, consensus is expecting that Apple will ship 
more watches in its first two quarters than it did iPad, despite, as you said, 
very limited 
distribution in terms of only selling through your store.

how, if at all, we

Tony Sacconaghi
 
You talked about the watch having lower margins in the third quarter, which 
is surprising A) I think in the context of pr

thought were higher, B) in the context of what luxury watches sell for, C) I 
think in terms of what estimated margins might be installed on accessories 
like your watch band.
 

 
margins are being 
burdened by lower volumes and startup costs, and that you believe that as a 
category, watch margins will be, in total, including everything else that you 
sell with it, on a sustained basis, lower than the company average.

over year growth in the Greater China 
revenue, and clearly very strong 
iPhone. If you can talk a bit about what consumers are saying, what the 
carriers are saying, in terms of demand and opportunity. Just any color, 

 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah, it was an incredible quarter
. We were up 71% year over year. We set 
a record in China for revenues. We did that now in a quarter that included 
Chinese New Year, and so we have the help of a strong holiday season, 

y in 
the March quarter.
 
iPhone led the way. It was up over 70% year on year. And the current 
estimates from Kantar are that that would mean that we would gain more 
than 9 points of share on a year over year basis. And so by everything I can 
see, we did ext
remely well.
 

happy with this, that Mac unit sales were up 31%. And like the rest of the 
world, or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in 
China contracte
d by 5% last quarter. And so once again bucking the tide.
 
Also, in China, consistent with the company but at a much different rate, the 
App Store had a record quarter and grew over 100% year over year. And so 
you can see the iPhone, the Mac, and the App St
ore adding, and with the 
iPad in PRC, not in Greater China, but in the PRC, iPad had its best quarter 
ever, higher than all the others, and also grew in a market that contracted 
for the overall market.
 

ook at in China was 
extremely good. We have been working significantly on expanding our 
ecosystem there, and so we added Union Pay as a payment option for 
customers. We increased the iPhone point of sales to over 40,000 during the 

9% year on year. And more importantly than the 
total number, we are in many more cities than we were before.
 
We worked significantly on our online store. Our online store revenue was up 
over three times year over year. As you probably heard us say before, 



online store will also be expanding from around 319 cities to where they can 
hit two day delivery 
to 365 cities. So adding about 50 new cities by the end 
of this quarter.
 

in our products, on partnering with different companies. The Chinese 
developers are coming on in signif

payments to developers in Greater China of almost $5 billion over half of 
which was in the last 12 months.
 
And so you can see this enormous momentum building in the developer 
community there as well. And so lots of positive th
ings, and you know, as

take to reaccelerate iPads? The sellthrough was better than the sell in this 
quarter, but are we seeing cannibalization from the iPhone 6 plus a
nd how 
are you sort of thinking about the IBM partnership as it relates to iPad?
 
Tim Cook
 
Number one, we have to stop having the situations where we sell through 

That was over a mil
lion units. Two, have we had cannibalization? The answer 


about that. It is what it is. That will play out,
 
and at some point, it will 

 
The IBM partnership, I think, is in its early stages in terms of bearing fruit 

lity for iPad 

that play out as we move forward.
 
If you look at the underlying data, it makes you feel a lot better than the 
sales do. And so things like first time buyer rates, the 
latest numbers from 

almost 70%. And so these numbers are not numbers that you would get if 

seen people write that
, that I think that theory is not correct, and do not see 
that.
 
We also see usage numbers that are off the charts, so far above competition 

100%. And so these kind of numbers, al
ong with intent to buy numbers, 
everything looks fantastic, the ecommerce numbers.
 
And so my belief is that as the inventory plays out, as we make some 

already have planned and have 
had planned for some time, between that, 
the inventory playing out, the enterprise starting to take over, I think still I 
believe the iPad is an extremely good business over the long term. When

believe that it will.

Luca, could you comment a bit about the factors that went into your decision 
on the capital return program, particularly the share repurchase part? For 
e

down. So you are dependent upon cash flow in the U.S. as well as debt. And 

want to go over? Do you want to 
keep your AA rating? Is that important? 
Just other factors like capital spending needs, just curious what your 
thinking was.
 
Luca Maestri
 
The logic has not changed over the years. We look at our business plans, we 
look at what we want to 
accomplish from product perspective. We look at 
the capital needs that we have to run the business and to grow the business. 

shareholders.
 
We know Apple very well. We are very exc
ited by the level of customer 

about the pipeline of products and services that we have, and therefore, we 
believe that there is great value in our stock.
 
And that is the reason why, a

We also know, and understand, that we have several investors that value

From a funding standpoint, of course we have a very strong balance sheet. 
We do have some cash in the U.S. We will continue to generate cash in the 
U.S., but definitely a good portion of the program will be funded through 
debt. We will raise 
debt both in the U.S. and outside of the United States.

Kulbinder Garcha
 
My first question is for Tim. Tim, on the point you made about the 20% of 
t
he [unintelligible] being on 6 or 6 plus, are we right in interpreting the 

previous cycles? And that would, I guess, argue for just a longer period of 
growth as the [unintelligible] upg
rades? And then also, linked to that, just by 

being higher, that number year on year, in the first six months, is really 
growing significantly year on year. Is that the right wa
y to interpret that 
comment?
 
Tim Cook
 
I missed the second part of your question totally. Can you get a little closer 
to your phone?
 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
Oh, sorry, yes. My second part of my question is, in the first six months of 
the 6 plus, is the gross numbe

users or switches from Android, significantly growing year on year?
 
Tim Cook
 

of your questions. My understanding of what you asked was is
 
the 20% 


top of my head.
 



about switchers and first time buyers.
 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
Okay great, and then Luca, just on the gross
 
margin decline from the March 

a little bit older. I guess of the iPhone and the watch impact, is the decline 
equally attributed to both those reasons, or is there something differ
ent 
going on?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Let me tell you, there are a number of reasons why our guidance for gross 
margins is lower than the actual for the second quarter. The first one is the 
loss of leverage, because of the sequential decline in revenue. We got the 
fo
reign exchange, we got as you said, a lower iPhone mix. And we got the 

specifics. But those are the four reasons that drive the sequential decline.

Tim, this is for you. You mentioned something in your past comment that 
you thought a lot of the iPhone sales were going into the middle class in 

at and open it up 
more broadly speaking, to the emerging geographies. If you have 
demographics that you could talk about for your iPhone specifically, and 
where you think those phones are ending up. Because I think it does raise 
the question, as you look o

or 

within the emerging markets, BRIC countries were up 64% year over year.
 
And so as I look at that, without having market research data on the 

clear to me that it has to be coming 


significantly into the middle class.

it sounds like HBO 
Now is a great opportunity today, and as you look out. If you could just 
speak more specifically, how we should be thinking about Apple as a conduit 
for something like HBO Now and other products. Is that a meaningful 
revenue opportunity
 
without getting specific, and/or is it more about selling 
incremental devices, or is it about expanding the revenue pie as you look at 
opportunities like HBO Now?
 
Tim Cook
 

giving to them in Apples classic ease of use and in the product environments 

 
And so I think HBO in particular has some incredibly great content. And so

Apple, Inc.
 
Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As we closed the 
books on a very successful fiscal 2017, I have to say I couldn't be more 
excited about Apple's futu
re. This was our biggest year ever in most parts of 
the world with all
-
time record revenue in the United States, Western Europe, 
Japan, Korea, the Middle East, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia. 
We had particularly strong finish this year, genera
ting our highest 
September quarter revenue ever as year
-
over
-
year growth accelerated for 
the fourth consecutive quarter. Revenue was $52.6 billion, above the high 
end of our guidance range, and up 12% over last year. We generated 
revenue growth across all 
of our product categories and showed all
-
time 
record results for our Services business.
 
As we expected, we returned to growth in greater China, with unit growth 
and market share gains for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. In fact, it was an all
-
time 
record quarter fo
r Mac sales in mainland China as well as an all
-
time high for 
Services revenue. And revenue from emerging markets outside of greater 
China was up 40%, with great momentum in India, where revenue doubled 
year over year. We also had great results in enterpri
se and education with 
double digit growth in worldwide customer purchases of iPad and Mac in 
both markets.
 
Gross margin for the September quarter was at the high end of our guidance 
range, and thanks to exceptional work by our teams, we generated record 
fo
urth quarter earnings per share of $2.07, up 24% from a year ago. iPhone 
sales exceeded our expectations. In the last week and a half of September, 
we began shipping iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to customers in more than 50 
countries. They instantly became o
ur two most popular iPhone models and 
have been every week since then.
 
As we speak, the launch of iPhone X is now underway as stores open across 
Australia and Asia. iPhone X is packed with innovative new technologies that 
chart our path for the next decade
, technologies like the TrueDepth camera 
system, Super Retina Display, and A11 Bionic chip with neural engine, which 
has been in development for years with a focus on deep machine learning. 
iPhone X enables totally new experiences like unlocking your iPhon
e with 
Face ID, taking photos with studio
-
quality lighting effects, or playing 
immersive augmented reality games. We can't wait for people to experience 
our vision of the future. Orders have already been very strong, and we're 
working to get iPhone X into 
customers' hands as quickly as possible.
 
Turning to Services. Revenue reached an all
-
time quarterly record of $8.5 
billion in the September quarter. A few quarters ago, we established a goal 
of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue of $24 billion by th
e year 2020, 
and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. In fiscal 2017, we reached 
$30 billion, making our Services business already the size of a Fortune 100 
company.
 
We're also delighted to report our second consecutive quarter of double
-
digit 
unit
 
growth for iPad. Customers have responded very positively to the new 
iPad lineup. And with the launch of iOS 11, the iPad experience has become 
more powerful than ever, with great new features for getting things done 
like the new dock, Files app, drag and
 
drop, multitasking and more power 
than most PC notebooks.
 
The launch of iOS 11 also made iOS the world's largest platform for 
augmented reality. There are already over 1,000 apps with powerful AR 
features in our App Store today, with developers creating a
mazing new 
experiences in virtually every category of apps aimed at consumers, 
students and business users alike. Put simply, we believe AR is going to 
change the way we use technology forever.
 
We're already seeing things that will transform the way you wo
rk, play, 
connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that let you interact with 
virtual models of everything you can imagine, from the human body to the 
solar system. And of course, you experience them like they're really there. 
Instantly, education
 
becomes much more powerful when every subject 
comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in 
your living room before you make a purchase, or attending live sporting 
events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to 
change 
everything.
 
iOS 11 is also allowing developers to integrate machine learning models into 
their apps with Core ML. Pinterest is already using Core ML to deliver fast 
and powerful visual search. PadMapper uses Core ML to provide intelligent 
features t
hat make it easy to find or rent your apartment. And VisualDx is 
even pioneering new health diagnostics with Core ML, automating skin 
image analysis to assist dermatologists with their diagnoses. These are just 
a few examples. There's so much more to come.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which had its best year ever, with the 
highest annual Mac revenue in Apple's history. It was also the best 
September quarter ever, with Mac revenue growth of 25% driven by the 
notebook refreshes we launched in June an
d a strong back
-
to
-
school season. 
The Mac experience has become even better since the September launch of 
macOS High Sierra, with new technologies to make Mac more reliable, 
capable and responsive and lay the foundation for future innovation.
 
Moving on now
 
to Apple Watch. With unit growth of over 50% for the third 
consecutive quarter, it continues to be the best selling and most loved 
smartwatch in the world. We began shipping Apple Watch Series 3 just six 
weeks ago and customers love the new freedom of cel
lular. The ability to go 
for a run with just your Apple Watch or go for a quick errand without your 
phone while staying connected is a game changer. Now more than ever, 
Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life and is already making a 
big diffe
rence in our customers' lives. We're very excited about the 
upcoming launch of the Apple Heart Study, which will use data from Apple 
Watch to identify irregular heart rhythms and notify users when unusual 
patterns are detected.
 
Earlier this week, we introd
uced watchOS 4.1, bringing 40 million songs to 
your wrist through Apple Music. The combination of music streaming on 
Apple Watch and AirPods is truly a magical experience for people on the go. 
We're thrilled with the momentum of these products. In fact, ou
r entire 
wearables business was up 75% year over year in the fourth quarter and in 
fiscal 2017, already generated the annual revenue of a Fortune 400 
company.
 
Late in the September quarter, we also launched Apple TV 4K, delivering a 
stunning cinematic expe
rience at home. So now users around the world can 
watch movies and shows in 4K HDR quality and stream live sports and news 
on the Apple TV app. There's already a great selection of 4K HDR titles 
available through iTunes and other popular video services wit
h many more 
movies and shows on the way.
 
We're also very excited about the opening of Apple Michigan Avenue two 
weeks ago on Chicago's riverfront. This is the first store that brings together 
our complete vision for the future of Apple retail, providing a 
welcoming 
place for everyone to experience our products, services and inspiring 
educational programs right in the heart of their city. In addition to our very 
popular Today at Apple programming, which is available in all Apple Stores 
around the world, offe
ring daily sessions in photography, music creation, art 
and design, coding and entrepreneurship, Apple Michigan Avenue is 
partnering with local nonprofits and creative organizations to make an 
ongoing positive impact in that community.
 
Also this quarter, w
e expanded our free App Development with Swift 
curriculum to more than 30 community colleges across the country. We're 
very excited about this initiative, and we're thrilled by the momentum we're 
seeing. The schools we've launched with this summer are just
 
the beginning. 
Community colleges have a powerful reach into communities where 
education is the great equalizer, and the colleges adopting our curriculum 
this academic year are providing opportunity to millions of students to build

We're incredibly enthusiastic about what our teams have accomplished this 
year and all the amazing products in our lineup. As we approach the holiday 
season, we expect it to
 
be our biggest quarter ever. I'd like to thank all of 
our teams, our partners and our customers for their passion, commitment 
and loyalty. You've helped us make 2017 a sensational year.
 
Now for more details on the September quarter results, I'd like to tu
rn over 
the call to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the September 
quarter was a record $52.6 billion, up 12% over last year, and it has been 
great to see our growth rate accelerate in every quarter of f
iscal 2017. Our 
terrific performance this quarter was very broad based, with revenue growth 
in all our product categories for the second quarter in a row and new 
September quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the 
rest of Asia
-
Pacific s
egments.
 
We grew double digits in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, 
Korea and several other developed markets. We were especially happy to 
return to growth in greater China, where revenue was up 12% from a year 
ago and with our momentum in I
ndia, where revenue doubled year
-
over
-
year. We grew more than 30% in Mexico, the Middle East, Turkey and 
Central and Eastern Europe. These results have fueled overall growth of over 
20% from emerging markets.
 
Gross margin was 37.9%, at the high end of our 
guidance range. Operating 
margin was 25% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion. Diluted 
earnings per share were $2.07, up 24% over last year to a new September 
quarter record and cash flow from operations was strong at $15.7 billion.
 
During the 
quarter, we sold 46.7 million iPhones, up 3% over last year. We 
were very pleased to see double digit iPhone growth in many emerging 
markets including mainland China, the Middle East, Central and Eastern 
Europe, India and Mexico. We gained share not only i
n those markets but 
also in Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Singapore, 
based on the latest estimates from IDC.
 
iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.3 million units sequentially to 
support the launch of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, significantl
y less than the 
increase in the September quarter a year ago.
 
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both 
consumers and business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 
Research on consumers indicates a customer satisfacti
on rating of 97% or 
higher across all iPhone models. Among consumers planning to buy a 
smartphone in the next 90 days, purchase intention for iPhone was 69%, 
more than 5 times the rate of the closest competitor with a loyalty rate for 
current iPhone owners
 
of 95% compared to 53% for the next highest brand. 
For corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 95% and of 
those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% 
planned to purchase iPhone. That is the highest score for iPho
ne in the 
history of the survey.
 
Turning to Services, we set an all
-
time quarterly record of $8.5 billion, up 
34% year over year. Our results included a favorable one
-
time revenue 
adjustment of $640 million. On a run rate basis, excluding this adjustment, 
services growth of 24% was terrific and the highest that we have 
experienced this year. The App Store set a new all
-
time record, and 
according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be the preferred 
destination for customer purchases by a wide and g
rowing margin, 
generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. We're getting great 
response to the App Store's new design in iOS 11 from both customers and 
developers. We're seeing increases in the frequency of customer visits, the 
amount of time they 
spend in the store and the number of apps they 
download.
 
The success of Apple Music also continues to build and we're seeing our 
highest conversion rates from customers trying the service. Revenue grew 
strongly once again in the September quarter and the n
umber of paid 
subscribers was up over 75% year
-
over
-
year. We also saw great 
performance from our iCloud business with very strong double
-
digit growth 
in both monthly average users and revenue.
 
Across all of our Services offerings, the number of paid subscr
iptions 
reached over 210 million at the end of September quarter, an increase of 25 
million in the last 90 days.
 
Apple Pay expanded to Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UAE last month 
and continues to grow rapidly. Over the past year, active users have more
 
than doubled and annual transactions are up 330%. In the U.S., 70% of 
leading grocery chains are now accepting Apple Pay with the recent launch 
of Safeway and over 5 million U.S. merchant locations will be Apple Pay 
enabled by the end of this year.
 
Next, 
I would like to talk about the Mac, which for fiscal 2017 set a new all
-
time revenue record of $25.8 billion. We sold 5.4 million Macs during the 
September quarter, up 10% over last year and gained significant market 
share as the global market contracted b
y 1% based on IDC's latest estimate. 
This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro and 
Mac revenue grew 25% to a new September quarter record. We had 
outstanding results all around the world with each of our geographic 
segments grow
ing Mac revenue by 20% or more. We were also very happy 
with the success of Mac in the education market where customer purchases 
grew double digits year over year.
 
It was also another great quarter for iPad. We sold 10.3 million units, up 
11% over last yea
r with strong demand for both iPad and iPad Pro and 
revenue grew 14%. It was great to see iPad unit and revenue growth in all 
of our geographic segments and particularly strong results in emerging 
markets, including greater China, where iPad units sales we
re up 25% year
-
over
-
year and India, which grew 39%.
 
NPD indicates that iPad had 54% share of the U.S. tablet market in the 
September quarter, including seven of the 10 best
-
selling tablets. That's up 
from 47% share a year ago. Also, the most recent surveys
 
from 451 
Research measured customer satisfaction rates of 97% across iPad models. 
And among people planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 
70% for both consumers and businesses.
 
We are seeing great momentum with our enterprise initiativ
es. During the 
September quarter, we announced a new partnership with Accenture, who is 
creating a dedicated iOS practice in select locations around the world. 
Experts from Apple are co
-
locating with this team and together they'll be 
launching new tools an
d services that help enterprise clients transform how 
they engage with customers using iPhone and iPad.
 
Examples include services to build new customer experiences and to 
facilitate iOS integration with enterprise systems to help businesses take 
greater ad
vantage of data from Internet of Things platforms and to enable 
the smooth transfer of existing legacy applications and data to modern iOS 
apps.
 
And last month, we announced a partnership with GE to reinvent the way 
industrial companies work by bringing GE
's industrial IoT platform to iOS. 
The (20:37) SDK for iOS will enable developers to build native apps to drive 
industrial operations with more efficiency and speed than ever before. GE is 
also standardizing on iPhone and iPad for its global workforce of m
ore than 
330,000 employees and working with Apple, GE is developing iOS apps for 
both its internal and external audiences to bring predictive data and 
analytics to workers across a broad range of industries.
 
Beyond our iOS devices, we are also seeing great
 
traction for Mac in the 
enterprise market with all
-
time record customer purchases in fiscal year 
2017.
 
The September quarter was very strong for our retail and online stores, 
which welcomed 418 million visitors. Traffic was particularly heavy during 
the w
eek of our new product announcements, up 19% over last year. Retail 
ran a very successful back
-
to
-
school promotion in the Americas, Europe, 
China and Singapore, with sales of Mac and iPad Pro up strong double digits 
compared to last year's program. And aro
und the world, our stores 
conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions during the quarter.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $268.9 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $7.4 
billion. $252.3 bi
llion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United 
States. We issued $7 billion in new Canadian and U.S. dollar denominated 
debt during the quarter, bringing us to $104 billion in term debt and $12 
billion in commercial paper outstanding.
 
We also
 
returned $11 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 
billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 
29.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also 
launched a new $3 billion ASR program, res
ulting in initial delivery and 
retirement of 15.1 million shares and we retire 4.5 million shares upon the 
completion of our 11th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed 
almost $234 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $166 
b
illion in share repurchases.
 
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. As a reminder, the December quarter in fis
cal 
2017 spanned 14 weeks, whereas the December quarter this year will 
include the usual 13 weeks.
 
We expect revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion. We expect 
gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be 
between $7.65 billion a
nd $7.75 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $600 
million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also, today our Board 
of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common 
stock, payable on November 16, 2017, to shareholders of rec
ord as of 
November 13, 2017.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Luca, when do you expect to catch up 
with iPhone X demand? And given it's likely to be not in the December 
qu
arter, should we think about March as a better than seasonal revenue 
quarter because of that iPhone X ramp? And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I'll take that, Katy. It's Tim. The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially 
considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created 
and it has lots of new technologies in it. And so we're really happy that we 
were able to increase week
 
by week what we're outputting and we're going 
to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible. I 
can't predict, at this point, when that balance will happen. And in terms of 
March, we obviously don't give guidance beyond the curren
t quarter.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. And then China growth returned to strong double digits, 12% up. 
You've talked historically about that region being more sensitive than others 
to form factor changes and the new iPhone X form 
factor was not available 
in September. And so should we assume that growth in that region only 
accelerates from here as that new product gets pushed into the market.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Let me talk a little bit about Q4 in China to give you a lit
tle bit of color on 
the results. We increased market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the 
quarter. We hit all
-
time revenue records for Services and for Mac for the PRC 
during the quarter. We've had very strong iPad revenue growth. We had 
double digit 
unit growth in iPhone and both the upgraders and Android 
switchers were both up on a year over year basis during the quarter, and so 
the results were broad based. They were pretty much across the board, as I 
indicated.
 
The other thing that's happened is th
at the decline that we've been 
experiencing in Hong Kong moderated. And so it's still down year over year 
but less so than it was and part of that is the compare is an easier compare.
 
And then finally, in terms of another headwind that is a little less tha
n it 
was, currency has been affecting us more significantly. Last quarter in 
China, it affected us 1 percentage point. And so the sum of all that, I feel 
great about the results. We don't obviously provide geographic
-
specific 
guidance but you can see from 
our overall guidance, we think we're going to 
have a really strong quarter.

Good afternoon 
and congrats on a strong quarter. Is there any information 
you can provide on how iPhone X pre
-
orders compared to what you saw with 
iPhone 8 pre
-
orders? And then I have a follow
-
up as well.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Michael, we never go through mix, bu
t I would share with you that the 
iPhone X orders are very strong for both direct customers and for our 
channel partners, which as you know, are lots of carriers throughout the 
world. And we couldn't be more excited to get underway. And I think as of a 
few
 
minutes ago, the first sales started in Australia. And I'm told we had 
several hundred people waiting at the store in Sydney and I'm getting 
similar reports from across that region.
 
Michael J. Olson 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
All right. Thanks. And we're excit
ed about augmented reality and from your 
perspective, and maybe from our perspective on the outside looking in, how 
do we gauge the success of AR and what are some of the applications of the 
technology that you're most excited about today? Thanks.
 
Timothy 
D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes, it's a great question. The reason I'm so excited about AR is I view that 
it amplifies human performance instead of isolates humans. And so as you 
know, it's the mix of the virtual and the physical world and so it should be a 
help
 
for humanity, not an isolation kind of thing for humanity.
 
As I go through different countries as I've been traveling lately, and looking 
at some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool 
thing is they're all over the place. I see 
things that the consumer's going to 
love because it's going to change shopping. I see things that consumers will 
love on the gaming side and the entertainment side. I see business
-
related 
AR apps as well. They're going to be great for productivity and betw
een 
small and large business. And I see apps that makes me want to go back to 
K
-
12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in 
the classroom a lot.
 
And so the real beauty here is that it's mainstream. And of course, Apple is 
the on
ly company that could have brought this because it requires both 
hardware and software integration, and it requires sort of making a lot of 

 
or giving the operating system update to many people at once. And the 
software team worked really hard to make tha
t go back several versions of 
iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices 
overnight. And so there's 1,000
-
plus in the App Store right now. I think this 
is very much like in 2008, when we fired the gun in the overall App Store. 
An
d so that's what it feels like to me, and I think it will just get bigger from 
here.

From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.
 
Shannon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
Thank yo
u very much. A couple questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit 
about how you're thinking in terms of the lineup? You go from $340 

 
this is 
for iPhone 

 
you go from $349 to above $1,000. And it appears that you 
probably sold a fair amount at the lower
 
end. Perhaps that was just some of 
the switchers in China and maybe drove some of the growth in China in 
terms of market share. But how are you sort of thinking about what went 
into the guidance for the December quarter? Are you seeing really strong 
deman
d at the low end and obviously expected benefit from the X at the 
high end? I'm just trying to understand because you have such a broader 
lineup than you've had in prior years.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes. In terms of what we saw in Q4, you can 
probably tell from the ASP we 
had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones. And we've 
tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that 
really want an iPhone but may have a more limited budget. And we've got 
som
e iPhones that are really great for that market. And then we've got three 
new iPhones and people will look at these and decide which one they want. 
And this is the first time we've ever been in the position that we've had 
three new iPhones at once like thi
s at the top end of the line. And it's the 
first time we've had a staggered launch. And so we're going to see what 
happens, but we put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the 
guidance that Luca presented, and you can tell from that, that we'r
e bullish.
 
Shannon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
Great. Thank you. And then in terms of Services, $8.5 billion, up 34%, can 
you talk about some of the portions of that that outperformed, how 
sustainable? You mentioned China in terms of significant growth i
n Services, 
but I'm just curious. That's a pretty remarkable number, so I'm curious what 
the drivers were. Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes, Shannon. It's Luca. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was 
a $640 million adjustment and there 
was a one
-
off change. And it's 
important to call it out because of course it's a one
-
off. And so the 
underlying growth rate for service in the quarter was fantastic. It was 24%. 
It's the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal 2017. 
S
o the business is going incredibly well. I would highlight maybe three of 
these businesses within Services at the App Store set a new all
-
time record. 
It's going incredibly well.
 
The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's 
ver
y, very important to us for the App Store business. Apple Music was up, 
subscriptions were up 75% year over year. We're getting the highest 
conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. And so we 
turned the corner in Music. You remember 
that a few years ago, we were 
actually declining in Music; now with the streaming service in addition to the 
download business, the business is growing again. And that really helps the 
growth rate for the entire Services business.
 
iCloud is a service that 
continues to grow very strong double digits, and 
that's also helping. So we already become the size of a Fortune 100 
company. We set a goal for ourselves to double what we did in fiscal 2016, 
and the trajectory is actually quite positive.

Steve Milunovich with UBS.
 
Steven Milunovich

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thank you. I wanted to try to push a little bit more on the mix. Could you 
comment whether the 8 Plus outsold 
the 8 in the quarter? There seems to be 
some data that suggests that. And the 451 Research survey that you're 
alluding to also finds that over the next 90 days, those buying an iPhone, 
43% are planning on buying the X. Could you comment upon your 
expectati
ons in terms of the mix going forward? And if you won't do that, 
perhaps you could comment a bit about your thinking in terms of pushing 
price elasticity. I think a couple years ago, nobody would've imagined selling 
a phone at this price and obviously, you
're pretty confident that you can do 
it.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Obviously, I'm not going to talk about mix. That's something that we've 
done in the past. If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, 
they instantly became our top two selli
ng products. If you look at 8 Plus in 
particular, to provide a little color there, 8 Plus for the period of time that we 
can measure to date, has gotten off to the fastest start of any Plus model. 
That for us was a bit of a surprise, and a positive surpris
e, obviously. And so 
we'll see what happens next. As I've mentioned before, we've never had 
three products and it's only today that the first customers can sort of look at 
all three of those and I'm sure there's been some people that wanted to do 
that befo
re deciding even which one. And so we'll see what happens there.
 
But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a 
large number of people pay for the phone by month. And so if you were to 
go out on just the U.S., since that tends 
to be more of the focus of this call, 
you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find you could buy an iPhone 
X for $33 a month. And so if you think about that, that's a few coffees a 
week. It's let's say less than a coffee a day at one of these nice
 
coffee 
places.
 
The other thing to keep in mind is that many people are now trading in their 
current iPhone on the next iPhone. And the residual value for iPhone tends 
to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so 
for their iPh
one and so that even reduces the monthly payment less. And 
then obviously, some carriers also have promotional things going on. And so 
I do think it's important to try to place it in that context.
 
In terms of the way we price, we price to sort of the value
 
that we're 
providing. We're not trying to charge the highest price we could get or 
anything like that. We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering. And 
iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the 
industry, and it
 
is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start 
getting it in their hands.

And then I wanted ask, the Street historically has been a little skeptical 
about continued innovation and you've suggested there 
is more to go. 
Historically, you weren't first to large screens, you weren't first to OLED. 
Now though, you're leading in AR, you're leading with face ID, which the all
-
in a year ago, as some of your guys have suggested, was kind of very 
reminiscent of the
 
aggressive Apple. Is it possible going forward that you 
could accelerate share gains from Android because you're now in a stronger 
competitive position?
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I think, Steve, we've been in a competitive position. And so I probably 
maybe have a different view than you do or the folks that you're quoting. 
There's always doubting Thomases out there. And I've been hearing those 
for the 20 years I've been here and suspect I'll hear about them until I 
retire, right. So I don't really list
en to that too much. There's lots of fantastic 
people here and they're doing unbelievable things. And yes, I view AR as 
profound. Not today, not the app that you'll see on the App Store today, but 
what it will be, what it can be. I think it's profound and 
I think Apple is in a 
really unique position to lead in this area.

We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
 
LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. Just following up a little bit on that question, Tim. You 
talked a bit about providing a lot of value and that Apple sets its prices 
according to value. And I think given the uniqueness of the product you 
have with the iPhone X in part
icular, that makes a lot of sense. I guess the 
question is given the uniqueness of the value that you have in the 
marketplace, why shouldn't we 

 
should we, or why shouldn't we expect 
gross margins to improve this cycle versus previous ones? And perhaps yo
u 
can talk a little bit about how you think about pricing in the context of gross 
margin. And I have a follow
-
up, please.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Toni, I'll take that one. When 

 
you said we price our products for the value 
that we deliver. We also 
said that every time we launch new products, the 
cost structures of the new products tend to be higher than the products that 
they replace. It's inevitable. We are adding new technologies, new features, 
and therefore the cost structures go up. We have a ve
ry good track record of 
taking those cost structures and over the life cycle of the product, we are 
able to bring them down.
 
There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good 
control over and there are also elements that we don't contr
ol. Take for 
example foreign exchange, which has been a significant headwind for the 
company for the last three years now. Also, the mix of products that we sell 
into the market tends to change over time, and that also has an impact on 
the overall gross ma
rgin for the company. There are situations where the 
commodities markets are in good shape. There are situations where 
commodity markets can be a bit out of balance.
 
We have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for 
the time being. So
 
there's many puts and takes. The fact that our Services 
business is growing, it should be a positive because our Services margins 
tend to be accretive to company margins. So there's many puts and takes. 
We tend to think about maximizing gross margin dolla
rs because we think 
that's the most important thing for investors at the end of the day. When we 
look at our track record over years, I think we've found a good balance 
between unit grow and gross margins and revenue, and we will continue to 
do that as we 
go forward.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to revisit this notion of supply 
and demand, and I realize it's very early and you can't make predictions. I 
think a common investor question is,
 
the iPhone X was made available for 
sale. It quickly had pushed out availability levels to unprecedented levels 
versus history. And so I think the really significant question is, is that initial 
push
-
out really a function of uniquely strong demand versus 
history or is 
that push
-
out in availability really a function of much weaker supply versus 
history?
 
So it'd be really helpful. You have in the past commented on first 24
-
hour 
orders, for which there were 4 million plus for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. You 
have
 
very often on this call talked about targeting when you think you could 
reach supply/demand balance. So it'd be really helpful if you could provide 
some context in terms of what you know, either about initial orders or about 
a supplies versus history that
 
can help investors try and better understand 
the little data points that they're seeing in terms of availability of the device. 
Thank you.

see from the guidance that we are very bullish. And so, and we 
feel really great about the product lineup. We just sold the first units 
minutes ago. And so we'll see how things go. Until you get all of them out 
there where customers have the ability to de
mo and support, I think any 
kind of mix discussion is very much estimating. And so we put our best 
estimates in, but grantedly, we've never done this before. So there's no 
comparison here, with either the three iPhones nor the staggered launch. So 
we're go
ing to learn something.

Thanks very much. And I'll ask my original question and follow
-
up at the 
same time because they're slightly different topics. But you'd mentioned 
great success in India. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you 
mentioned, I think, India doubled year over year. Based upon market 
analysis, it looks like Apple's sti
ll just a relatively small sliver of the pie 
there. So Tim, what would it take be even more successful in India? Is it a 
manufacturing footprint there? Is it partners? Is it more physical stores? Is it 
lower price points? Is it the bandwidth that has now c
aught up to many 
other countries, or how should we think about that?
 
And then the follow
-
up question is on the AR/VR, where will it really show up 
in your income statement? Are you hoping more for hardware sales or 
services through the apps or where the ex
citement will then monetize it 
within Apple? Thank you.

In terms of India, many of the things that you mentioned are correct. 
Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them 
all well. And so 
it's analogous to the many years that we put into China. It's 
building stores. It's building channels. It's building markets. It's building the 
developer ecosystem. It's having the right product lineup for the market. 
And I feel like we're making good prog
ress there and are gaining 
understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go, which I sort 
of see as an opportunity instead of a problem. And I do feel great about the 
growth rate. And so that's India. I think it's all of those things.
 
As you
 
know, as I think we talked about before, we started manufacturing 
the iPhone SE there six, nine months ago so. And the majority of the iPhone 
SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured 
there. And so we also have that going and 
are hoping that that winds up 
saving some amount of money over time and avoiding some of the 
compounding of taxes, et cetera.
 
The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being 
addressed and between the large carriers there with 
Bharti and now Jio 
investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it 
was just 12 months ago. So there's been a sea change there in a short 
period of time. So I feel good about all that, but we have a long way to go.
 
In terms of 
the monetization question on AR/VR, we tend to focus first and 
foremost on customer experience. And so we're all about making sure the 
experience is great. And we think that if we get the experience right, that 
revenues and profits will be a result of gett
ing that right. And so we're very 
much focused on the experience right now.

That will come from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets,

Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I have two as well. I guess maybe 
to start with on gross margins. Luca, year 
over year revenues are going to 
be up high single digits at the midpoint, gross margin will be down a little. 
Could you just tell us what are the puts and takes on that? And are yield 
inefficiencies broadly much more severe this time versus what you've see
n 
historically?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes. Amit, so we're guiding 38% to 38.5%. That's up 35 bps sequentially. 
Obviously we're getting the leverage from the larger volumes. As I 
mentioned, I think to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we 
launch new products. So that is going to be the offset, and I mentioned 
particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment which is a 
headwind at this point. Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our 
gross margin is 40 bps sequentially 
and 110 bps on a year over year basis. 
So they are meaningful impacts, and I think that is what I think probably 
you're referring to.

Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess if I could just follow up on the 
Servi
ces line. I mean you guys talked about it a fair amount earlier, but 
even if you exclude the one
-
time gain, it looks like the back half of 2017 
accelerated by 500 basis points in fiscal 2017 versus the first half of 2017. 
Qualitatively or quantitatively, i
s there a way to think about how much of 
this is from expanding of the installed base, which is one of the three things 
you mentioned I think, versus more dollar per iOS device that you see?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes. I think it's both. As I mentioned
, particularly on the App Store, which is 
very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot. It's 
grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base has grown, but also 
because we have made a number of changes that have made it easier f
or 
our customers around the world to participate on the App Store and be able 
to transact on the App Store. We are accepting, for example, more forms of 
payment today than we were 12 months ago or even 6 months ago. So 
that's been very important.
 
We also s
ee that there is a typical spending curve for our customers. When 
they start transacting on the Store, they start at a certain level and they 
tend over time to get more familiar with the Store and they start to spend 
more. We're also now, very recently, ma
de some changes, as you probably 
have seen, to the design of the App Store. And I was mentioning to you in 
the prepared remarks that these changes have been received very 
favorably. And so people now are spending more time on the Store, they 
download more 
apps, and that over time translates into monetization.
 
But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and 
actually accelerating. I mentioned Music. I mentioned iCloud, and so it all 
adds up. And as you correctly point out, our growth ra
te is accelerating.

From Drexel Hamilton, Brian White.

Yeah, Tim, I'm wondering if we take a look at mainland China and we thi
nk 
about iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, they've been on sale for a while now. 
What has been the just general response to those two new iPhones and also 
preorders around the iPhone X in mainland China?
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Brian, I hate to repeat this
, but we don't really disclose mix. We view it as 
competitive information that we want to hold tightly ourselves. In terms of 
the way the preorder process works in China in the channel, so not in our 
direct channel, but in the broader carrier channel and c
hannel, they 
generally take indications of interest versus something that I would label a 
preorder. And so I would hesitate to even quote a number for fear it could 
be misconstrued. And we'll find out what the demand and where the supply 
and demand meet so
metime in the future. I don't know when yet, but we're 
really excited to get going to find out.
 
Brian J. White

And, Tim, it's interesting that sales grew 16% sequentially. If you look at the 
past five years, sales were up 7% in the Se
ptember quarter, so that's an 
average. Yet you didn't have all your iPhones in the market. So if you had 
to, what would you attribute that to? It's a pretty big disconnect, 16% 
versus an average of 7%.
 
Timothy D. Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Our emerging market perf
ormance during the quarter was very strong. And 
if you take China out, it's even stronger. But you can see that China 
rebounded. And as I'd indicated before, the China rebound was broad based 
across the products. And so we just had a phenomenal quarter on 
iPad, on 
the Mac, on Services, on Apple Watch, on iPhone. I mean we're literally, 
we're firing on all cylinders. And so that's what, that and our new products 
give us great confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to 
be the best holida
y season yet.

call over to Nancy Paxton, 
Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please, go 
ahead.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking 
first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca 
Maestri. After that, we'll open the call 
to questions from analysts.
 
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion 
today will consist of forward
-
looking statements, including without limitation 
those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income 
an
d expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook. Actual 
results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.
 
For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in Apple's

Q, and the 
Form 8
-
K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. 
Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward
-
looking statements or 
information, which speak as of their respective dates.
 
I'd now like to turn the 
call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
 
Tim Cook
 
Thank you, Nancy and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This isn't the 
first time you've heard from us regarding the December quarter, so the first 
thing I want to do is provide some final results a
nd connect those back to 
the letter we shared at the beginning of the month.
 
As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original 
expectations, coming in at $84.3 billion. That's down 5% from a year ago, or 
down 3% adjusting for foreign exchang
e. We noted four factors that would 
impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different 
iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on 
certain products and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.
 
One of thos
e factors, weak macro conditions in some emerging markets was 
significantly more severe than we originally foresaw, especially in Greater 
China. As our letter noted, that challenge was compounded by quarterly 
iPhone upgrades that were lower than we anticip
ated.
 
We'll return to upgrades in a moment, but I'd first want to say a bit more 
about our business in Greater China. Our revenue there was down by $4.8 
billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac and iPad. Most of the 
shortfall relative to our
 
original guidance and over 100% of our worldwide 
year
-
over
-
year revenue decline was driven by our performance in Greater 
China.
 
Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew 
outside of China, including new records in the Ameri
cas, Western Europe, 
Central and Eastern Europe and our rest of Asia Pacific segment. We had 
record performance in large markets, including the United States, Canada, 
Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain and Korea.
 
In the letter we shared earlier this month, we s
aid we are proud to 
participate in the Chinese marketplace and that we believe our business has 
a bright future there over time. But I think some of that got lost, so I want 
to share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China.
 
We generated record D
ecember quarter services revenue in Greater China, 
fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5 million registered iOS 
developers. We saw very strong results from our wearables business there 
with revenues up over 50%. We also continued to grow our total a
ctive 
installed base by adding new customers.
 
In fact, more than two
-
thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or 
an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the 
first time. Finally, for perspective, despite the challenging
 
December quarter, 
our revenue from China grew slightly for the full calendar year. 
Macroeconomic factors will come and go, but we see great upside in 
continuing to focus on the things that we can control.
 
Returning to iPhone, I'd like to talk about our re
sults in the context of those 
lower than expected upgrades. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs, and iPhone Xs Max are 
by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped. They share advanced 
technologies including the A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a 
smartphone with 
our next
-
generation Neural Engine capable of 5 trillion 
operations per second. These are also completely modern iPhones with 
stunning large full screen displays and Face ID, the most secure 
authentication of any kind available in a smartphone.
 
And the came
ras are simply amazing with portrait mode and depth control to 
allow users to create studio quality photos as well as stunning 4K video, 
opening a whole new era of photography. We couldn't be more proud of our 
iPhone lineup and our industry
-
leading custome
r satisfaction. We wouldn't 
change our position for anyone.
 
Now, our customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in 
the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in 
emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone r
evenue that was down 15% from 
last year. Our iPhone results accounted for significantly more than our entire 
year
-
over
-
year revenue decline. In fact, outside of iPhone, our business 
grew strongly by 19%.
 
So, what's behind this? It's important to understand
 
what's going on from 
the customer perspective at the point of purchase. We believe that it's the 
sum of several factors. First, foreign exchange. The relative strength of the 
U.S. dollar has made our products more expensive in many parts of the 
world. In 
Turkey, for example, the lira depreciated by 33% over the course 
of calendar 2018 and in the December quarter, our revenue there was down 
by almost $700 million from the previous year.
 
Second; subsidies. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming 
i
ncreasingly less common. In Japan, for example, iPhone purchases were 
traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contracts. 
Competitive promotional activity frequently increase the amount of subsidy 
during key periods. Today, local regul
ations have significantly restricted 
those subsidies as well as related competition. As a result, we estimate that 
less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in Q1 of this year were subsidized 
compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total val
ue of 
those subsidies had come down as well.
 
Third, our battery replacement program. For millions of customers, we made 
it inexpensive and efficient to replace the battery and hold onto their 
existing iPhones a bit longer. Some people have suggested that w
e shouldn't 
have done this because of the potential impact on upgrades, but we strongly 
believe it was the right thing to do for our customers.
 
What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total 
active installed base of devices ha
s grown from 1.3 billion at the end of 
January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all
-
time high for each of the main product categories and for all five of our 
geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base 
a 
powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's 
also fueling our fast
-
growing Services business.
 
In fact Services revenue set an all
-
time record at $10.9 billion in the 
December quarter growing 19%. We not only generated our
 
highest global 
Services revenue ever, but we also had all
-
time records across multiple 
categories of Services including the App Store, Apple Pay, cloud services and 
our App Store search ad business and we had a December quarter record for 
AppleCare. And I
'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching 
the iTunes Store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever 
thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid 
subscribers.
 
The App Store wrapped up its best yea
r ever with record holiday period 
results propelled by the biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever. 
Customers also spent over $322 million on New Year's Day alone setting us 
new single
-
day record for both the number of customers and purchase 
volume. 
It was also a great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8 billion 
transactions in the quarter well over twice the volume of the year
-
ago 
quarter.
 
Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestones. Customers can now 
use Apple Pay with iPhone and Appl
e Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway 
locations, while all Target Taco Bell and Jack
-
in
-
the
-
Box stores will be 
accepting Apple Pay soon. We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in 
the December quarter Germany, Belgium and Kazakhstan and is now live in 
27 m
arkets around the world.
 
The rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank 
reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an 
entire year. This is yet another example of what's possible when you bring 
together Apple
's world
-
class hardware, software and ecosystem with our 
engaged and active user base. Shoppers around the world love Apple Pay 
and it has increasingly become an indispensable part of daily life.
 
Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly 
with year
-
over
-
year 
revenue up over 40% in the December quarter. And readership of Apple 
News set a new record with over 85 million monthly active users in the three 
countries where we've launched the United States, the U.K., and Australia.
 
Here in the U.S
., the latest data from Comscore shows that Apple News has 
the largest audience of all news apps. And the international audience will 
continue to grow with our first
-
ever bilingual launch in Canada available to 
customers later this quarter.
 
In summary, we'
re very happy not only with the growth, but also the 
breadth of our Services portfolio. Our revenue from Services has grown from 
less than $8 billion in calendar 2010 to over $41 billion in calendar 2018. 
The largest category represents less than 30% of to
tal Services revenue and 
the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing 
tremendous growth.
 
We had our best quarter ever for Mac revenue which was up 9% fueled by 
our new MacBook Air and Mac Mini introduced in October. The MacBoo
k Air 
includes a beautiful new Retina display, Touch ID and Force Touch Trackpad 
while the new Mac mini provides a powerful, flexible solution for everything 
from home automation to giant render forms.
 
iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in al
most six years 
powered by the new iPad Pro released in November with its edge
-
to
-
edge 
Liquid Retina display, Face ID and A12X Bionic chip, the new iPad Pro has 
been described by reviewers as a tablet with no equal and the most powerful 
mobile device ever m
ade. We also had our best quarter ever for Wearables 
Home and Accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth 
from Wearables, thanks to strong sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods.
 
We don't measure our success in 90
-
day increments. We manage Ap
ple for 
the long term and when we consider the keys to our success over time there 
are three that stand out, our highly satisfied and loyal customers, our large 
and growing active installed base and at the heart of it all, our deeply 
ingrained culture of i
nnovation. Thanks to all this our ecosystem is stronger 
than ever before.
 
We have an amazingly talented team creating hardware, software and 
services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience. 
Apple Watch is a powerful example of t
hat. It's humbling to read e
-
mails 
from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has 
dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and 
active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions such as AFib 
and by h
elping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and 
emergency SOS.
 
We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to 
improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities. Another 
example is the work we're doing wit
h silicon. We've embedded machine 
learning directly into the silicon with our A12 Bionic chip. Our custom Neural 
Engine not only provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a 
very small package, but it also enables processing of data and transa
ctions 
directly on the device.
 
This means iPhone can recognize patterns make predictions and learn from 
experience and it does all this while keeping personal information private. 
This is a powerful example of how innovation and privacy can go hand
-
in
-
hand
 
at a time when these issues are increasingly important to our users.
 
We are undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve our 
results. It's not in our DNA to just stand around and wait for macroeconomic 
conditions to improve. One such in
itiative is making it simple to trade in an 
iPhone in our stores and raising awareness of this opportunity. Because of 
the quality and durability of iPhones, they maintain significant residual value 
making trade
-
ins a great opportunity. It's not only great
 
for the 
environment, it's great for the customer as their existing phone acts as a 
subsidy for their new phone and it's great for developers as a phone that is 
traded in and redistributed can help grow our active installed base.
 
Beginning last week, we st
arted making it easier for people to pay for their 
phones over time with installed payments and we're working on rolling out 
this program to more geographies as soon as we can.
 
We are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business and 
we 
have a very strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting 
announcements coming later this year.
 
Apple innovates like no other company on earth and we are not taking our 
foot off the gas. We'll continue to invest through near
-
term headwinds ju
st 
as we always have and we'll emerge stronger as a result.
 
Now for more details on our December quarter results, I'd like to turn the 
call over to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As Tim said, revenue for the 
December quarter w
as $84.3 billion. This result was below our expectations, 
but we were able to set new all
-
time revenue records in the U.S., Canada, 
Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and Korea.
 
Our results were especially strong in the U.S. where re
venue was up by 
more than $1.5 billion compared to a year ago and in several markets where 
revenue grew by double digits including among others Germany, Spain, 
Poland, Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam.
 
Looking at product categories. iPhone revenue declined 15%
 
from a year 
ago while revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all
-
time 
record, including our best results ever for Services, for Wearables and for 
Mac.
 
Company gross margin was 38%. This quarter for the first time, we're 
making an important n
ew disclosure to our investors as we believe it will 
foster a better understanding of our business. We are now reporting on a 
quarterly basis, gross margin for products in aggregate and for Services in 
aggregate. Products gross margin was 34.3% and Service
s gross margin 
was 62.8%.
 
On a sequential basis, products gross margin increased 60 basis points due 
to positive leverage from the holiday quarter, partially offset by higher cost 
structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from 
foreign
 
exchange.
 
Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points sequentially due to 
favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by foreign exchange. While both 
products and services gross margins improved sequentially, total company 
gross margin was down
 
30 basis points due to a different mix between 
products and services.
 
Net income was $20 billion about flat to last year and diluted earnings per 
share were an all
-
time record at $4.18, an increase of 7.5% over last year. 
Operating cash flow was also very
 
strong at $26.7 billion.
 
Let me provide more color for the various products categories. iPhone 
revenue was $52 billion. On a geographic basis, most of the decline from 
last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets with difficult 
macro and f
oreign exchange conditions affected our results. We also believe 
that the reduction of carrier subsidies and our battery replacement program 
had an impact in a number of countries around the world. And as Tim 
mentioned we had a lower number of upgrades tha
n we had anticipated at 
the beginning of the quarter.
 
However, our global active installed base of iPhones continues to grow and 
has reached an all
-
time high at the end of December.
 
We are disclosing that number now for the first time. And it has surpassed
 
900 million devices, up year
-
over
-
year in each of our five geographic 
segments and growing almost 75 million in the last 12 months alone. We 
plan to provide information on the iPhone installed base as well as total 
installed base on a periodic basis. Cust
omer satisfaction and loyalty for 
iPhone continue to be outstanding and are the highest in the industry.
 
The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer 
satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among 
business 
buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the March quarter 
81% plan to purchase iPhones. Based on the latest information from Kantar, 
iPhone experienced a 90% customer loyalty rating for iPhone customers in 
the U.S. 23 points above the next highest brand
 
measured.
 
Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10.9 
billion, up 19% year
-
over
-
year with new December quarter records in all five 
of our geographic segments. Many Services categories set new all
-
time 
revenue records and we are
 
on track to achieve our goal of doubling our 
fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020.
 
To be clear and as we've already explained 90 days ago, our 2020 goal 
remains unchanged and it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification 
between products and serv
ices we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the 
new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the 
beginning of fiscal 2019.
 
The level of engagement of our customers in our ecosystem continues to 
grow. The number of transacting 
accounts on our digital stores reached a 
new all
-
time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts 
growing by strong double digits over last year. And we now have over 360 
million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of
 
120 
million versus a year ago.
 
Given the continued strength and momentum in this part of the business, we 
now expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 
2020. Our subscription business has become very large and diversified 
cover
ing many different categories from entertainment to health and fitness 
to lifestyle. In fact, more than 30,000 third
-
party subscription apps are 
available today on the App Store and the largest of them accounts for only 
0.3% of our total Services revenue.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to the new 
MacBook Air and Mac mini that we introduced in October, which helped drive 
a 9% increase in Mac revenue over last year to a new all
-
time record. Mac 
revenue was up in the vast majority 
of countries we track with double
-
digit 
growth in many large markets such as the U.S., Western Europe, Central 
and Eastern Europe, Japan, Korea and South Asia.
 
Our active installed base of Macs reached a new all
-
time high and half of all 
the customers purc
hasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac. 
We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago. A 
strong performance of both iPad and iPad Pro and generated double
-
digit 
growth in four of our five geographic segments. Similar t
o the Mac, our 
installed base of iPads reached a new all
-
time high and among customers 
purchasing iPad during the quarter half were new to iPad.
 
The most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured a 94% 
customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall,
 
with iPad Pro models scoring as 
high as 100%.
 
Among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the March 
quarter, 68% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, home and accessories 
revenue grew 33% to a new all
-
time record in each of our geographic 
segme
nts.
 
Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year 
ago, thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods both of 
which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter.
 
Based on revenue over the past four quarters, our W
earables business is 
approaching the size of a Fortune 200 company. Our retail and online stores 
generated strong results for Mac and iPad and all
-
time record performance 
from Services and from Wearables.
 
Following the launch of the new iPhone trade
-
in cam
paign, our stores more 
than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, 
reaching an all
-
time high in Q1.
 
We added Thailand to our footprint with a beautiful store in Bangkok and we 
opened a stunning new store on Champs
-
Elysees in Paris e
xiting the quarter 
with 506 physical stores in 22 countries. In enterprise, across multiple 
industries our technology continues to enable businesses to do their best 
work.
 
In healthcare, iPhones and iOS apps continue to streamline and support 
clinical work
flows, communications and care delivery across leading health 
systems including Johns Hopkins Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, 
Stanford Health Care and Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital.
 

 
bearings and seals, 
has transformed their manufacturing processes on iOS and iPhone with 
incredible success. With custom iOS apps available to production operators 
across their worldwide locations, SKF has reduced production errors from 20 
percent to zero
 
while saving 70% in system
-
related time.
 
Apple technology has made possible a simplified user experience integrating 
the SAP cloud platform, yielding better accuracy, efficiency, and employee 
experiences across the board.
 

n in the construction industry, with iPad 
and new third
-
party apps made for iOS. For instance, Procore Technologies 
has introduced an app to help decrease building errors on the job site.
 
By using Metal in Split View with the iPad camera, construction work
ers can 
compare building plants and 3D models to what is actually being built in real 
time. This new iOS app reduces wasted raw materials and helps keep 
building projects on time and on budget.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter wit
h $245 
billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.8 billion in term 
debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position 
of $130 billion.
 
As we explained in the past, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral 
pos
ition over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $13 billion to our 
investors during the December quarter. We repurchased 38 million Apple 
shares for $8.2 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.6 
billion in dividends and equivalents
.
 
Consistent with our historical cadence, we plan to provide an update on our 
overall capital return program when we report our March quarter results. As 

includes the types of forw
ard looking information that Nancy referred to at 
the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $55 billion and 
$59 billion. This range reflects a negative year
-
over
-
year impact of $1.3 
billion from foreign exchange, which represents about 210
 
basis points of 
last year's revenue and a more uncertain macroeconomic environment than 
a year ago, especially in emerging markets.
 
We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. On a sequential 
basis, this range reflects seasonal loss of leverage and 
a 60 basis point 
unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by commodity 
cost savings. We expect OpEx to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion. 
We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be 
about 17%.
 
Also toda
y, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per 
share of common stock, payable on February 14, 2019 to shareholders of 
record as of February 11, 2019.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Luca. And 
we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. And 
may we have the first question please?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you. Good afternoon. Servic
es growth did decelerate from the growth 
rates in recent quarters, so can you talk about the factors that played into 
that slower growth? And then, appreciate the new disclosure around paid 
subscribers.
 
But if you compare what you added in 2018 
versus what you expect to add 
over the next two years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new 
subscribers. So should we be thinking about services as a lower growth 
segment than what you experienced in 2018? And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes
, Katy, let me take that one. First of all, when we talk about the services 
business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have. As 
you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size 
of our business from fiscal 201
6 to 2020, which implied at the time a 19% 
CAGR.
 
So far, we've been able to grow about 20%. In fiscal 2018, we grew 22%. 
So we are on track to achieve our objective. And it's important to 
understand what is driving the growth of the business. First of all,
 
it's our 
installed base.
 
As we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely. It has 
reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December and really very 
little of our services revenue is driven by what we sell in the last 90 days.
 
The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this 
installed base the percentage of users who are paying for at least one 
service is growing very strongly. This is due to several factors. First of all, 
we're offering more and mor
e services. During the last few years, as you 
know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and advertising service for our 
developers on the App Store. All these businesses are growing very strongly.
 
Second, we are making it easier for our customers to transac
t on our digital 
stores. We accept many more payment methods today which are very 
common in certain countries around the world. We've also increased the 
distribution coverage for many of these services. We're bringing AppleCare 
to more points of sale aroun
d the world. We are launching Apple Pay in more 
and more markets and so on.
 
Thirdly, as you mentioned, our subscriptions are becoming a very large 
portion of our business and they're growing very well above services 
average. And the fact that we are saying
 
that we will surpass 0.5 billion 
during 2020, we're not putting a specific date during 2020, but I think 
you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million 
on a year
-
over
-
year basis for a number of quarters now. And this is an 
incre
dible staggering number, right, when you think about it.
 
We are also broadening the scope of many of these services. If you take 
Apple Pay as an example, it started off as the most convenient, most private 
and most secure way to make a payment in a store o
r in an app. Then we 
took Apple Pay to Safari, then we started a peer
-
to
-
peer service and we're 
launching it in new markets across the world every quarter, so we are 
broadening that scope.
 
And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last t
hree years, 
we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services 
going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users and we're 
really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us.
 
I think you're ref
erring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've 
seen in the December quarter. And I think you're referring back to the 
growth that we reported in September.
 
I think an important point I need to make, and I think it's helpful that you 
asked the que
stion, is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a 
reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in 
connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. And 
as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization 
of free services in the past 
was reported under Products and now gets reported under Services.
 
The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the 
amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets 
applied to a gro
wing base. So this reclassification reduces our growth rate 
versus the previous classification. This factor by itself represents roughly 
one
-
third of the deceleration that you're seeing.
 
We talked about 27% growth in the September quarter. With the 
reclass
ification that growth rate was about 24.5%. So that explains about a 
third of that deceleration.
 
There are, I would say three factors that explain this difference between the 
24.5% to the 19%. The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. 
Roughly 60
% of our Services business is outside the United States. And as 
you know the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months. And in general, 
we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent 
basis.
 
The second factor is a well
-
known 
issue around the App Store in China. The 
App Store in China is a large business for us. We believe this issue around 
the approval of new game titles is temporary in nature, but clearly is 
affecting our business right now.
 
And then thirdly, we are seeing so
me level of deceleration in AppleCare, 
which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal 2018, where we're 
starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in 
place recently and the channel fill of Apple components that happened
 
when 
we increase the distribution coverage. But in general, we are very, very 
pleased with 19% growth and we think that the business will continue to 
grow nicely going forward.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you for that color. Just a quick follow
-
up, Luca. Share rep
urchases in 
the December quarter were well below the run rate from the June and 
September quarters. How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability 
to carry out the buyback at the same level? And what should we think about 
is the right run rate goin
g forward?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Well, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our 
program. We have done almost $250 billion of repurchases from the 
beginning of the program. But we've also said that we want to execute the 
program in an efficient, 
effective, I will say, disciplined manner. And that 
takes into account also overall market conditions.
 
So, that's what we did during the course of the December quarter. We 
--
 
our 
fundamental view remains the same. We are optimistic about our future and 
we 
think there is great value in our stock. And so we will continue to execute 
the program. We will continue to report at the end of every quarter. And by 
the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about 
the next step in our capital 
return program which is something that we do 
traditionally in the spring.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research.
 
Steve Milunovich
 
Great. Thank you
 
very much. Some have the perception that you priced the 
new products, the new iPhones too high, what have you learned about price 
elasticity? And do you feel that perhaps you pushed the envelope a little bit 
too far and might have to bring that down in th
e future?
 
Tim Cook
 
Steve, it's Tim. If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the 
iPhone Xs in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X a year ago. The 
iPhone Xs Max which was new was $100 more than the Xs. And then we 
priced the XR 
right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and entry 
iPhone 8 Plus have been priced. So, it's actually a pretty small difference in 
the United States compared to last year.
 
However, the foreign exchange issue that Luca spoke of in the call and 
--
 
made
 
that difference or amplified that difference in international markets, in 
particular the emerging markets which tended to move much more 
significantly versus the dollar.
 
And so what we have done in January and in some locations and some 
products is essent
ially absorbed part or all of the foreign currency move as 
compared to last year and therefore get close or perhaps right on the local 
price from a year ago. So, yes, I do think that price is a factor. I think part 
of it is that, the FX piece.
 
And then sec
ondly in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared 
remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed 
markets. I had mentioned Japan, but also even in this country even though 
the subsidy has gone away for a period of time. 
If you're a customer that 
your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases even a 7, you may have 
paid $199 for 

 
and now in an unbundled world it's obviously much more 
than that. And so we are working through those and we've got a number of 
actions to ad
dress that including the trade
-
in and the installment payments 
which I had mentioned as well.
 
Steve Milunovich
 
I know that you're not giving units going forward, but you said you might 
make qualitative comments. I was wondering, if you have a comment 
parti
cularly on the ASP on a year
-
over
-
year basis?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Well Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing 
of our phone launches would affect the year
-
over
-
year compares. If you 
remember, our top models the Xs and Xs Max shipp
ed during the September 
quarter, which plays the channel fill and the initial sales in that quarter. 
While last year the iPhone X shipped in Q1 in the December quarter, plays in 
the channel fill and initial sales in the December quarter. So we knew that 
th
is would create a difficult compare for Q1 of 2019 and this is essentially 
what happened. It was pretty much in line with our expectations. To give 
you more color I would say that, the XR is our most popular model and it's 
followed by Xs Max and then the X
s.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes. Thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, looks like the 
midpoint of your 
Q2 revenue guidance implies the steepest Q1 to Q2 
sequential decline in iPhone revenues in history. It also implies a year
-
over
-
year deceleration in iPhone revenues. And I'm wondering, if you can 
comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're en
tering the 
quarter with a high level of channel inventory and maybe you can comment 
explicitly on that, or whether you actually think the macroeconomic 
conditions are getting worse?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yeah. I mean three questions there. The first one is a questi
on around 
conservatism. As we always do when we provide a range, it's a range that 
we believe we're going to fall within. We've done pretty well with that up 
until the December quarter, right? I mean, we've been 

 
we didn't miss in 
years and years. So that
's the idea. There isn't a specific level of 
conservatism. We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall 
within.
 
On channel inventory, as you know our historical pattern for iPhone channel 
inventory is that typically we increase inventory in 
Q1 and we decrease in 
Q2. And we think this year will be similar and we've exited the December 
quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with. So that leaves 
us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1 from a revenue 
standpoint was
 
minus 15%. And we expect that the key factors that Tim 
mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have 
an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, the negative impact from curren
cy is going to be about $1.3 
billion, so that's about a bit more than two points versus last year's revenue 
and so that obviously plays a role. And the macroeconomic environment 
particularly in emerging markets will continue to be there. On the positive 
si
de, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of 
the business which is not iPhone.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Okay. Tim, at your September event Lisa Jackson, an Apple VP, stated the 
company needed to quote design products to last as long a
s possible. And 
Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, 
iOS working on an older range of products et cetera. But I guess the 
question is why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for 
iPhones should continu
e to extend going forward in part because that's 
almost one of your objectives? And maybe to that end, maybe you can help 
us understand what iPhones' average replacement cycle might be today, and 
how that may have changed over the last three to five years.
 
And again, 
why wouldn't you expect it to elongate over time given some of the 
aforementioned things? Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
We do design our products to last as long as possible. Some people hold 
onto those for the life of the product and some people trade t
hem in. And 
then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. And so it doesn't 
necessarily follow that one leads to the other. The cycles 
--
 
the average 
cycle has extended. There's no doubt about that. We've said several times I 
think on this call an
d before, that the upgrades for the quarter were less 
than we anticipated due to the 
--
 
all the reasons that we had mentioned. So, 
where it goes in the future, I don't know, but I'm convinced that making a 
great product that is high quality, that is the be
st thing for the customer and 
we work for the user. And so that's the way that we look at it.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Than
k you very much. I wanted to ask about the trajectory of Services gross 
margin, up about 500 basis points it appears year
-
over
-
year. You talked a 
little bit about sequential. But what's driving the improvement or will it be 
volatile as we go through the ye
ar depending on quarters and mix? Just 
whatever color you can give us as we start to forecast this? Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, Shannon. I think you've seen that Services gross margins increased on 
a year
-
over
-
year basis by a significant amount. Let me 
start with sequential 
because I think it's probably most relevant for us. Sequentially, we increased 
170 basis points. It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good 
support from our scale. Some of these services are scaling quickly and so we 
tend 
to expand gross margins there. And also, we had favorable mix. As you 
probably know, we have a very broad portfolio of Services. Some of them 
tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because 
of the way we account for them.
 
For ex
ample, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net 
basis and therefore the gross margins tend to be accretive. But we also have 
services that are very successful, that are below the average for the services 
business.
 
And so depending on how th
ese separate businesses do in the marketplace, 
we're going to be seeing some level of movement going forward on services 
margins. But you've seen that for the last 12 months they've gone up nicely 
450 basis points and sequentially they've gone up 170 basis
 
points.
 
But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how this services gross 
margin is going to move over time. We will report of course at the end of 
every quarter. But important to keep in mind, it's a broad portfolio with very 
different gross margin
 
profiles within the portfolio. It is important for us to 
grow gross margin dollars. And if at times we grow services that are at a 
level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for 
the customer and as long as we generate gross ma
rgin dollars we're going 
to be very pleased.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Okay, thank you. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about video? You've 
signed a myriad of deals. There was announcement about 
--
 
there are TV 
app directly on Samsung. So perhaps when this comes out 
you'll be multi
-
platform. I'm just curious how you view the opportunity in video. And I 
guess assuming, you can just leverage the costs that you've made already, 
it should be accretive to margin I would think?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah, Shannon, we see huge changes in
 
customer behavior taking place 
now. And we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of the 
breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years.
 
And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. And so 
we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways. One of those is 
through Apple TV and you're well familiar with that product.
 
The second way is AirPlay 2, which we have as just pointed out we have 
support on a number of different third
-
party TVs. A
nd we're excited about 
that. It makes the experience in the living room with people using our 
products even better. We think that people are really going to like that.
 
Another way is, of course, all the third
-
party video subscriptions that are on 
the store
. We are participating in this today. And I would guess that that's 
going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people 
begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle.
 
And then finally, original content wh
ere we will participate in the original 
content world. We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. But 
today I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. 
We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence i
n 
and they're working really hard and we'll have something to say more on 
that later.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.
 
Walter Piecyk
 
Great, thanks. 
I just have a question on the free services. Can you just 
describe how the math works on that? Is it that the free services are non 
cash revenue that's getting booked in the Services revenue with no cost and 
then the costs come out of products? Can you jus
t run us through what the 
current status versus how you were accounting for that before?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes in essence when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an 
assumption. We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free 
services. 
In our case, it's providing Maps services, providing Siri and 
providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product. And so 
we calculate an estimated value. That value gets deferred and gets 
amortized over the estimated period of time that w
e deliver the free 
services.
 
In the past that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported 
under products. Now in connection with the new revenue recognition 
standard, we are reclassifying essentially that amortization from products 
revenue to ser
vices revenue. So total revenue has not changed, we just 
report that estimated value under the Services category. We also reclassify 
the cost that we need to incur to provide those services. So the gross 
margin rate of these services is clearly significant
ly dilutive to the overall 
Services margin. I hope I've...
 
Walter Piecyk
 
So it did make services gross margin, got it. And then my other 
--
 
my 
second question is just, when you think about growth in Services, you have 
selling more to existing paid subscrip
tion customers or it's the 300 million 
going to 0.5 billion. If you can just talk at a high level as far as when you 
look at growth going forward, is it about 
--
 
what is the mix in terms of 
selling more to existing users, getting new users or 
--
 
and maybe 
some of 
the individual services that you see the biggest growth opportunity? Thank 
you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. I mean as I said I mean essentially what 
--
 
services 
--
 
I said services 
too is our installed base. So the first driver is growing the installed base. 
Installed base has grown nicely over the last several years. We've added 
100 million in the last 12 months alone. So that's the first step. Then within 
that installed base, of course we want to make sure that there are more 
people that are so interested in
 
our services that in addition to transacting 
on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those 
services. And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has 
increased strong double
-
digits. So we want to continue to do th
at.
 
We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services and 
so we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world. 
And clearly, as you said the idea of adding new services is very important to 
us. During the last three yea
rs, we've added Apple Pay, which has been 
incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience.
 
We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid 
subscribers and continues to grow very nicely. And we've added a very 
useful servic
e to our developers. We provide an advertising service for 
developers in the App Store.
 
The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very 
interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our 
customers in the future. Now we don't want to get into product 
announcements here, but obviously that is part o
f our strategy.

Tim Cook
 
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. 

 
quarter and I'm incredibly proud of 

Interest in Apple products is at an all time high, with over 0.5 billion 
customer visits to our physical and online stores during the quarter. Demand
 
for iPhone has been staggering, shattering our high expectations with sales 
of over 74 million units, driven by the unprecedented popularity of iPhone 6 
and iPhone 6 Plus. This volume is hard to comprehend. On average we sold 
over 34,000 iPhones every hou
r, 24 hours a day, everyday of the quarter.
 
The execution by all of our teams to achieve these results was spectacular. 
By the end of the quarter, our new iPhones were available in 130 countries 
around the world, making this our fastest and most successful
 
roll out ever. 
Additionally, the App Store and the Mac each set new records for quarterly 
revenues. Mac units were up 14% to 5.5 million, while the rest of the PC 
market continued to decline. App Store revenues was up a remarkable 41%. 
Demand was strong a
round the world. Flurry estimated that Apple products 
accounted for over half of all mobile device activations globally from 
December 19th to December 25th.
 
It was truly a momentous quarter for iOS. On November 22nd we shipped 
our 1 billionth iOS device. I
t was a Space Gray 64 gigabyte iPhone 6 Plus, 


is to make the greatest products on earth and enrich t
he lives of others. 
Through the success of iOS we have provided hundreds and millions of 
people with powerful personal technology that is simple and fun to use. Our 
customers are using Apple products to transform education, discover new 
ideas for business 
and express their creativity in ways that no one could 

amazing to watch and it reminds that people and great ideas are the reasons 
we make the things we make.
 
Our strong overall pe
rformance in the December quarter resulted in total 
company revenue of $74.6 billion, and earnings of $18 billion. Both of these 
numbers are all
-
time records for us, with revenues up 30% and earnings up 
38% over last year. And due to our very large capital
 
return activities, 
earnings per share were up even more at 48% to $3.06, also an all
-
time 
quarterly record. Our results would have been even stronger, absent fierce 
foreign exchange volatility.
 

ew initiatives 

reaction to Swift, our new programing language. Inventing a new 
programing language is something very few companies can do, and we 
believe it will have a profound effect on ou
r ecosystem. Swift became 
available in September as part of the Xcode tools and in the first month 
those tools were downloaded over 11 million times. A recent report from 
Redmonk showed that Swift has had unprecedented growth and is quickly 
climbing the li
st of the most popular programing languages.
 

new projects, and we are seeing fantastic work with Swift going on in 
education. Very recently, Stanford University released their Devel
oping iOS 8 
Apps with Swift course, which was posted to iTunes University making this 
amazing resource available to everyone in the world.
 
There has also been incredible interest in HealthKit with over 600 developers 
now integrating it into their apps. Con
sumers can now choose to securely 
share their health and wellness metrics with these apps and this has led to 
some great, new and innovative experiences in fitness and wellness, food 
and nutrition and healthcare.
 
For example, with apps such as an American 
Well, users can securely share 
data such as blood pressure, weight or activity directly with physicians, and 
leading hospitals such as Duke Medicine, Stanford Children and Penn 
Medicine are integrating data from HealthKit into their electronic medical 
reco
rd so that physicians can reach out to patients proactively when they 
see a problem that needs attention.
 

beginning of amazing new health and wellness solutions for our customers. 
Our exte
nsions of iOS in the home with HomeKit and in the car with CarPlay 
also continue to progress and this year we are looking forward to amazing 
HomeKit enabled products from several companies, and CarPlay enabled 
vehicles from over 30 automotive brands.
 
Also 

making great progress on both of them. Apple Pay is off to a very strong 
start and the feedback that we are getting from both individuals and 
institutions is extremely positive. Today abou
t 750 banks and credit unions 
have signed on to bring Apple Pay to their customers, and in just three 
months after launch, Apple Pay makes up more than $2 out of $3 spent on 
purchases using contactless payment across the three major U.S. card 
networks.
 
In 
merchants who already accept Apple Pay, the rates are even higher. 
Panera Bread tells us Apple Pay represents nearly 80% of their mobile 
payment transactions, and since the launch of Apple Pay, Whole Foods 
Market had seen mobile payments increased by more 
than 400%. You can 
use Apple Pay up and down Mainstreet, to pick up a prescription at 
Walgreens at Duane Reade, get office or school supplies at Office Depot and 
Staples and shop for groceries at national and regional stores from coast
-
to
-
coast, including 
BI
-

Foods and Winn
-
Dixie among others.
 
More merchants are excited to bring Apple Pay to their customers and 
adoption is strong. Just today USA Technologies announced they made Apple 
Pay available at about
 
200,000 places where everyday payments happen, 
including vending machines and businesses, airports and schools, 
commercial laundry machines and colleges, universities and laundromats 
and parking meters and payment kiosks in lots across the country. Point
-
of
-
sale suppliers tell us they are seeing unprecedented demand from 
merchants, and all of our partners and customers simply love this new 
service. With all of this momentum in the early days, we are more convinced 
than ever that 2015 will be the year of Ap
ple Pay.
 
Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule and we expect to begin 
shipping in April. Developers are hard at work on apps, notifications and 
information summaries that we call Glances, all designed specifically for the 
Watch's user interface.
 
The creativity and software innovation going on 

customers to experience them when Apple Watch becomes available.
 

colla
boration is winning over new customers. In December, we delivered the 
first 10 MobileFirst for iOS apps for banking, retail, insurance, financial 
services, telecommunications, governments and airlines, making iPhone and 
iPad even more productive for enterp
rises by providing [Apple] [ph] Cloud 
services with IBM's Big Data and analytics capabilities. Another 12 apps will 
be released this quarter, including three new industries, healthcare, energy 
and utilities, and industrial products. This will bring us to a
 
total of 22 apps 

 
In just over a month, more than a dozen enterprise customers have signed 
on as foundation clients to transform their companies with iPhone, iPad and 
IBM MobileFirst solutions includi
ng Miami Dade County, the seventh largest 
county in the United States by population, and American Eagle Outfitters, 
which operates more than 1,000 retail stores and ships to over 80 countries 
worldwide. And the list of new customers is expanding rapidly. I
BM is 
engaged with more than 130 additional companies looking to empower their 
employees with MobileFirst for iOS solutions and the list keeps growing. We 

 
In addition to all these initiatives, we have a robus
t product and services 
pipeline that we are very excited about, and we look forward to sharing 
more about them with you throughout the year. In addition to the 
contributions we make to humanity through our products, we made great 
progress on imported proje
cts during the quarter including ConnectED and 

students in communities who need it the most. We recently chose 114 
schools across 29 states to receive an Apple ConnectED grant. Despite t
heir 
economic challenges, all of these schools share a vision of what their 

them bring that to life.
 
And in December, we undertook our largest ever initiative to help 
(PRODUCT)RED 
achieve the goal of an AIDS free generation. To 
commemorate World AIDS Day, we worked with some of our developer 
partners to create and donate the proceeds from 25 special apps and we 
also contributed a portion of sales at our retail and online stores on t
wo of 

record.
 

focus and determination from teams across Apple as well as our amazing 
developers and business
 


customers for their ongoing loyalty and enthusiasm.
 

quarter re
sults in more detail.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. In the December quarter we 
generated all time record revenue of $74.6 billion, an increase of $17 billion, 
or 30% year
-
over
-
year. We achieved this exceptional 
performance despite 
significant foreign exchange headwinds from many currencies.
 
Our growth was broad based across the world, with revenue from developed 
countries up 20% and revenue from emerging countries up 58%. The 
performance of our Greater China segm
ent was particularly impressive, with 
revenue up 70%. Sales were well ahead of our expectations in a number of 
areas. The unprecedented demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus combined with 
our tremendously successful production ramp allowed us to build and ship 
se
veral million more iPhones than we had expected when we provided 
guidance back in October. And also Mac revenue and services revenue 
reached all
-
time highs.
 
Gross margin was 39.9% above our guidance range and operating margin 
was $24.2 billion, representin
g 32.5% of revenue, and our highest operating 
margin percentage in 10 quarters. Net income was $18 billion, surpassing 
our previous all
-
time record by almost $5 billion. This translated to diluted 
earnings per share of $3.06, a 48% year
-
over
-
year increase.
 
Cash flow from 
operations was exceptional at $33.7 billion, also a new all
-
time record.
 
For details by product I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.5 million iPhones, 
an increase of 23.4 million over last year, representing 46% growth. iPhone 
sales grew s
trongly in both developed and emerging markets. Among many 
great results around the world, unit sales were up 44% in the U.S. and up 
97% in the BRIC countries.
 
Sales doubled year
-
over
-
year in China, our second largest iPhone market, as 
well as in Brazil an
d in Singapore. Thanks to the popularity of iPhone 6 Plus, 
and the increased value customers saw in our higher storage capacity 
offerings, iPhone ASPs were $687, an increase of $50 over the year ago 
quarter. This led to iPhone revenue growth of 57% year
-
ov
er
-
year, with 
quarterly sales exceeding $50 billion for the first time ever.
 
We had a 200,000 unit decline in iPhone channel inventory during December 
quarter this year, compared to an increase of about 1 million iPhones during 
the year ago period, and we 
were not able to reach supply demand balance 
until this month. This left us below our target range of five to seven weeks 


subscriber base, 
and we have over 210,000 points of sale for iPhone across the globe.
 
Our customers love their iPhones. A December ChangeWave survey 
measured a 97% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone. A study published 
by Chitika Insights last month in
dicated that iPhone accounts for 53% of 
North America smartphone web traffic, almost twice the level of the next 
closest brand. And in the corporate market ChangeWave found that among 
IT buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter this yea
r, 
77% intend to purchase iPhones.
 

almost 700,000 units over last year, a 14% growth rate. Thanks for the 
popularity of our stunning new iMac with Retina 5K display, Mac ASPs 
inc
reased by $58 sequentially, driving all time record revenue for Mac of 6.9 
billion. We achieved double
-
digit year
-
over
-
year unit growth in both 
desktops and portables. These results are truly remarkable, given the 
contraction in the global PC market which 
IDC estimates declined by 3% in 
the quarter. We have now gained market share for 34 of the last 35 
quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below 
our four to five week target range.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold 21.4 million units comp
ared to 26 million in the 
December quarter last year. Given the introduction of new iPads in October, 
we increased iPad channel inventory by 1.1 million units during the quarter, 
compared to an increase of about 2.1 million in the December quarter last 
yea
r. This left us within our five to seven week target range of channel 
inventory on a look forward basis.
 
Customer experience and usage data for iPad continue to be excellent. In 
our November survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction 
rate for 
iPad Air, and also found that among people to finding a purchase a 
tabled within 90 days, 60% plan to purchase an iPad. And among businesses 
planning to purchase tablets, the intent was even stronger at 78%.
 
Chitika Insights' most recent report indicated t
hat iPad users in North 
America generate over 70% of tablet based web traffic, more than six times

This record performance 
was driven primarily by the tremendous momentum 
of the App Store, with revenue growing 41% in the December quarter. Our 
iOS developers have earned over $25 billion from the App Store to date, and 

software from 
iTunes were $2.6 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in the year ago quarter.
 
Our direct China performance was also outstanding. We welcomed more 
visitors than ever before and generated record revenue in both our physical 
and online stores. We 
opened 10 new retail stores during the quarter, 
bringing us to a total of 447, 182 of which are outside the United States. 

track towards 40 stores in Greater China by mid

2016.
 
Let me now
 
turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $178 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $22.7 
billion. We completed our first international debt offering, issuing 2.8 billion 
euro denominated notes at very attractive
 
interest rates and greatly 
diversifying our debt investor base. We spent 5 billion to repurchase 45 
million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid 2.8 billion in 
dividends and equivalents, and utilized over 500 million to net share settle 
ves
ting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 8 million shares in 
connection with our accelerated share repurchase programs.
 
We have now taken action on almost $103 billion of our $130 billion capital 
return program, including $73 billion in share repu
rchases, with four 
quarters remaining to its completion. In the last 12 months alone, we have 
returned over $57 billion to our investors. We review our capital return 
program on an ongoing basis. We continue to solicit feedback from a broad 
base of investo
rs and we're on track to announce an update to the program 
in April when we report our second quarter results.
 

outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy 
r
eferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$52 billion and $55 billion, compared to $45.6 billion in the year ago 
quarter, and this represents a very significant revenue increase, despite 
growing foreign exchange headwinds fro
m the continued strengthening of 
the U.S. dollar against most currencies.
 
We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%, we expect OpEx 
to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion and we expect OI&E to be about 
$350 million and we expect the tax rat
e to be about 26.3%. Also today our 
Board has declared dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on 
February 12, 2015 to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2015.
 
With that let's open the call to questions.

Research.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much and nice iP
hone numbers. Can you talk about Luca 
about currency? How you are thinking about it? What it did this quarter? 


 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, 


Q1 has been unprecedented movements in currencies. I would say during 
the course of the quarter the bigges
t impact came from the Japanese yen, 
the Russian rubel, but also from euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar. Our 
revenue growth during Q1 would have been four percentage points higher 
on a constant currency basis.
 
On a profitability 
standpoint, our hedging program partially mitigated the 
impact from the volatility in currencies. As we look forward, and we look into 
particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be 
stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main r
easons. The first one is 
the fact that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against foreign 
currencies during the last few weeks. And the other one is the fact that our 
existing hedges expire. They get replace by new contracts at current levels 
and 
therefore the protection that is provided to us by our hedging program 
diminishes over time.
 
What that means to us going forward for the March quarter is that revenue 
growth on a year
-
over
-
year basis in constant currency would be five point 
higher than wha

terms of gross margins, and you know that we look our gross margins on a 
sequential basis, the gross margin percentage after the offset that we're 
getting from the hedging program will be impacted 
by over 100 basis points.
 
Now having said that, we have factored the impact that I just described into 

course, as you look further out, you know we do not provide guidance past 
the 
March quarter, but it goes without saying that at current levels, again 
those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reason I explained 
earlier, that our hedges continue to expire, they get replaced by new 
hedging contracts at current levels an
d so 
--
 
and there is the impact that we 
would see during the course of the year.
 
It goes without saying strong U.S. dollar has negative impact on our 
international business. Having said all that, we have provided what we 
believe is very strong guidance for
 
the March quarter. We remain very, very 
confident about the portfolio of products and services that we have in the 
market today and we remain very, very confident in the pipeline of products 
and services that we have.
 
Shannon Cross
 
And as a follow
-
up to t
hat, can you talk a little bit about pricing power? 
Basically as you think about currency and euro movements and that 
--
 
and 
then the contracts you have with the carriers, can you talk about maybe the 
opportunities to raise prices, because I know it's some
thing that a lot of 
companies are balancing right now?
 
Luca Maestri
 
I think as you know, we prefer to adjust local pricing at the time of new 

in normal times. When currencies move a
s much as they have been in 
places like Russia for example, sometimes we need to take mid
-
cycle action 

tend to be very volatile. So we just want to understand a bit better what is 
happening.

Steve Milunovich
 
I wonder if you could address the mix of the iPhone 6 line. Specifically, how 

units, maybe geograph
ic view, and also availability? Are you calling up on 
the 6 Plus?
 
Tim Cook
 

that iPhone 6 was the most popular iPhone last quarter, but I just believe to 
sell 74.5 million they 
were really all popular. And all did well. There is clearly 
a geographic difference where some geos would skew much higher on their 

not consistent around the world. But both did inc

really proud of them, along with the iPhone 5S and 5C as well, which 
continues to in the lineup.
 
Steve Milunovich
 
Okay. And then could you update us in terms of the sell through relative to 
the reported numbers for the Phone, the Pa
d and your biggest plans to 
increase by roughly a week of channel inventory?
 
Tim Cook
 
From an iPhone point of view, as I think Luca covered, our channel inventory 
decreased from the beginning of the quarter by 200,000 units, and that left 
us outside of our
 
target range on the low 
--
 
outside the low end of the range 
to be specific. Just recently we became in supply demand balance on the 6 
and 6 Plus in January. We were not able to reach a balanced state during our 
fiscal Q1.
 
On iPad, we increased channel inv
entory by 1.1 million units from beginning 
of the quarter to end of the quarter. That compares to the previous year 
where we're increased to 2.1 million. Obviously, that inventory was required 
because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with 
the iPad Air 
2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe during the quarter.
 
At the end of the quarter, we were within the target range of channel 
inventory on iPad. In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on 


function increase. We would expect it to occur more gradually over time 

inventory specifically as you know.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Steve. Can w
e have the next question please?
 
Operator
 

 
Katy Huberty
 
So not to dilute the fantastic performance in December, but can you talk a 
little bit about how you think about the sustainability of this very strong 
iPho
ne demand into 2015, particularly given that most carriers had access to 
that product during the quarter? And then I have a follow up on margin?
 
Tim Cook
 

that we are incredibly bull
ish about iPhone going forward. We believe that 



gs. I would point out that 
only a small fraction of the installed base has upgraded. And so there is a lot 
more people within the installed base. But I would also point out that we had 
the highest number of customers new to iPhone last quarter than in any 
prior launch. And also that the current iPhone line up experienced the 
highest Android switcher rate in any of the last three launches in the three 

about those.
 
And so we see 


the product and getting great feedback about the quality of the products 

ng markets which 
has been a source to great questions over time, the growth was absolutely 
stunning, in Brazil and Mainland China more than doubling year
-
over
-
year 
which is 3x to 4x what those markets were doing according to IDC. And so 
we enter the quarte
r with quite a bit of momentum.
 
Katy Huberty
 
And Luca as you know, you typically enjoy component cost downs and yield 
improvements as you move through a product cycle. Is there anything other 
than currency that keeps you from potentially locking the gross 
margins 
higher over the course of the year? Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 


quarter. It goes with our product cycle. The foreign
 
exchange headwinds as I 
was explaining to Shannon, they will be on a sequential basis a headwind of 
more than 100 basis points. So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange 
impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins.
 
The oth

the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 to Q2. When you look at our 
revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and 
30%. So you obviously have that loss of l
everage, but without a doubt the 
biggest headwind that we got right now is foreign exchange. Having said all 
that guiding 38.5% to 39.5%, we feel slightly very good about where we are 
right now in the cycle.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Katie could we have the next questi
on please?
 
Operator
 

 
Benjamin Reitzes
 
And Tim obviously a lot of good questions about the great iPhone number 
but I wanted to ask about the Apple Watch. Shifting in April, month or two 
later than I think you said orig
inally obviously, probably not that big a deal, 

timing and your excitement for it and maybe a little more color on other 
apps that could be available at launch? And any expectati
ons you have for it 
would be great.
 
Tim Cook
 
My expectations are very high on it. I'm using it every day and love it and I 

development of it. The number of developers that are writing 
apps more for 

there. And just to clarify, what we had been saying was early 2015, and we 
sort of look at the year and think of early as the first four months, mid is the 
next four mon
ths and late is the final four months. And so to us it's sort of 

--
 
but 

got a lot of customers that are wanting
 
to get one.
 
Benjamin Reitzes
 
And then just a follow
-
up in terms of China. How do you feel the momentum 
there is in terms of sustainability versus some of the local competition, and 
as you navigate that market specifically going forward?
 
Tim Cook
 
The local
 
competition was obviously there this quarter and has been there 
for many quarters before. And so the local competition is not new. I think we 

after the launch in October. And the 
excitement around the iPhone 6, iPhone 
6 Plus were absolutely phenomenal. And you can see that in the results with 
Mainland China being up 100% year
-
on
-
year, despite not having a full 
quarter of sales since we launched in the second half of October.
 
You ca


doubling that by mid
-
2016 as Angela has said earlier and Luca said in his 

rowing the channel there. Our 
online store has expanded to over 350 cities now, and in fact our online 
revenues in China last quarter were more than the sum of the previous five 

an
d we are going to do our best to serve the market.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 

 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue guidance. Luca you 
mention
ed the range as down 26% to 30% sequentially. I think if you look 
back over the last three or four Q1 to Q2s, revenues declined more in the 
15% to 20% range. As you noted, your iPhone channel inventory is below 
your target range as well. So if anything, th
at might be going up. So I'm 
wondering if you could just discuss a little bit what factors are contributing 
to this steeper than normal decline this quarter, particularly given your 
ongoing enthusiasm for the phone.
 
Luca Maestri
 

ar
-
over
-

end of the range. So we obviously feel good about a 20% growth. As we 
look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is 
important to point out. I mentioned the foreign exchange he
adwinds. They 
are there. We need to deal with them, but they obviously are a negative to 
revenue. Those are headwinds that we had this year and were not there a 

 

 
in the 

also a factor that impacts the sequential compare. And then there's a couple 
of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not 
going to repeat this
 
year. One of them is the fact that last year in January 
we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China 
Mobile. That of course is not going to repeat this year. And we also had a 
very, very strong quarter in Japan in the March qu
arter a year ago, which 
was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities, and a pull 
forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax 
increase that took place on April 1, and again that is not going to repeat. So 
wh
en you take those factors into account, I think that explains the 
sequential decline that we see this year. Again I want to point out to the 
20% year
-
over
-
year growth.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Luca just to confirm, sequentially my math is saying it's about two 
point 
incremental revenue headwind. Is that the right way to think about it?
 
Luca Maestri
 
From FX?
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes. Currency.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Right.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Sequentially, okay. Tim, I was wondering if I could have my 
--
 
direct my 
follow
-
up to you,
 

enthusiasm for the product on a go forward basis. Over the last year it's 
down double
-
digits from a unit perspective and ASP has also been declining. 
So I was wondering if you could comment on whe
ther your bullishness about 
the iPad persists and is it really 
--
 
do you believe it's a replacement cycle, 
that we will ultimately see that will start to drive growth or is there really 

ing to 
drive that growth?
 
Tim Cook
 

indicated before. When you measure it in these 90
-
day clips, as we do in the 

 
in the 
--
 
or 
an improvement in the year
-
over
-
year. But here is what I see when I look at 
it and the reason that I'm so optimistic. I see that the first time buyer rates 
are very high. And so by very high, I mean that if you look in some of the 
developed m
arket like the U.S., Japan, the UK, you would find that 50% of 
the people are buying an iPad for the first time. If you look in China, it's over 
70%. And so that 
--
 
when you have that kind of first time buyer rates, you 

 
When 
I look at the customer stat on iPad, it's literally off the charts, in some 
cases a 100%, which is unheard of in surveys to get these kind of customer 
stat ratings. When I look at the usage, the usage is six times our nearest 
competitor. The usage is defin
ed as measured in web browsing is like 71% 
of total tablets, as I think Luca covered earlier. Also the commerce taking 
place across the iPad is enormous. Essentially over 80% of the commerce on 
tablets are taking place on iPad. And so when I back up and lo
ok at all of 
these, and I believe that over the long arc of time that the iPad is the great 

very, very good about that. That said, I'm not projecting 
--
 
to be clear with 
everyone
, I'm not projecting something very different next quarter or the 
next. I'm thinking over the long run.
 
In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true, 
that the upgrade cycle is longer. It's longer than an iPhone, probably 
b


level of cannibalization that's going on with the Mac on one side and the 
Phone on the other. And so you pro
bably have a little bit of that that is 
shaking out. How much, very hard to tell on the early going, particularly 
since we just shipped the new phones a few months ago.
 
And so I think there's some things like that are going on. On the other side I 
think th
e partnership with IBM and the work that we have going on in the 

work. I'm really excited about the apps that are coming out and how fast the 
partnership is getting up and running.
 
And so I think that can move the dial there. And so I'm not predicting the 
90
-
day clips and so forth, but over long arc of time I really believe that iPad 
is a great space, a great product and with 
--
 
also coupled with the product 

think there is a very, very bright future for it.

We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
 
Gene Munster
 
A couple of questions for Tim. First, any updates on Apple TV or your 
broader biz in the living room? And second a high level 
question about Apple 
Pay and some of the successes at point
-
of
-
sales. Can you talk a little bit 
about if in app is important or how important that is? And potentially how 
the product could evolve over time? Could you see this becoming more 
consumer to cons
umer or more just kind of a broader payment platform? 
Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 


something that we continue to look at
 
and work on and find a way that we 

both the contactless payment and the in app are both important. I think 

di
fferent geographic regions as to which one is larger than the other and well 
likely

the mix of those things will change over time as more and more 
commerce flows across apps and so forth.
 
In terms of how it evolves, I think we're in the first inning on 
it. I'm not

we're just in the

And of course we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S. But I have to 

vably 
shocked, positively shocked at how many merchants were able to implement 
Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season, because generally most 

this in a lot of different mercha
nts and I give them a lot of credit for that.

Rod Hall
 
So I wanted to start off Tim. You talked about the smaller of the user base 
who have upgraded to 
iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. And I wonder if you could give us 
a little bit more color on that, maybe even go as far as quantifying how 
many of the base you think have upgraded and also talk a little bit about the 
pattern of upgrades? Are they all tending to be ove
r iPhones or is there are 
good spread? Can you give us any further color on that? Thanks.

-
teens or barely in the 
teens. And so when I look at that I say that there is an enormous amount 
left. 
And given there are fair amount of Android units out there, there is also 

remind you that there is a lot of people that have not yet bought a 


United States, but from a worldwide point of view there's still lots of them. 
And so I see all three of those groups there and I'm very excited about all of 
them, and serving all of them.
 
Rod Hall
 

 
like to direct at Luca. Luca, I wonder, could you 
talk a little bit about the duration of the hedge contracts and the renewal 
pattern that we should expect to see this year? Just kind of remind us what 
your typical renewal pattern is and will you be accel
erating that this year 
given all the currency movement?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes Rod. Typically, I think, we have clearly active hedging programs of 
winning the market almost every day, but we tend to hedge three to 12 

 
had to go a bit longer, if 
we feel that we have a strong conviction about certain currencies. Otherwise 
again the typical period is three to 12 months. And as hedges roll off, we 
replace them with new hedges. We take into account the exposures that we 
hav
e around the world, taking into account our most recent forecast and we 
hedge accordingly. We feel very good about our hedging position and the 

maybe we needed to hedge a bit more t
han we have done historically.
 
Tim Cook
 


 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. There are some exposures where the cost of hedging is prohibitive or 
the financial instruments are 
not there to hedge. And in those cases of 

 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Rod. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 

 
Amit Daryanani
 
I just ha
ve two questions. One maybe just on the gross margin side. I want 
to understand, the 100 basis points of headwind that you're talking about in 
the March quarter, is that sort of is 
--
 
there is some still protection on the 
hedges or is that a raw number wit
h no hedges in place?
 
Luca Maestri
 

impact after the hedges. The impact without hedges would be higher. And 
again this is sequentially right. Because on a year
-
over
-
year basis actua
lly 
the impact is larger, given the fact that currencies have moved during the 
last 12 months. But the 100 basis points that I quoted includes the 
mitigating impact of the hedging program.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
And just, when you think about the iPad and you talk
ed about the IBM 
partnership where you're seeing some traction. Could you just talk about 
what sort of penetration do you guys think iPads have on an enterprise side 
right now and how do you see that improve over the next few quarters as 
you roll out the M
obileFirst modules with IBM.
 
Tim Cook
 
We think that what we know, that if you look at the Fortune 500 as an 


re is 
extremely high. The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking are only 
deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce. And so the real 
opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people 
work. In order to do that
, you obviously need apps that are written to 
specific jobs, not just apps that are general productivity apps like work 
processors and spreadsheets and presentation tools et cetera.
 

 
that and the knowledge of the verticals, which they bring a significant 
amount of knowledge on all of the verticals that I mentioned earlier. And so 
where can we take that to? I think if we can really change the way people 
work, I think the opportunity is
 


partnerships as you probably know. And so when we do one, it is significant 

 
one and 
what it can do for customers.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you Amit. Can we have the next question please?

Sherri Scribner
 
Luca, I was hoping you can give us some detail on your 
expectations for 

significantly in new products, but wanted to see how we should think about 
those trending over the next couple of quarters?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Sherry, as you know, we provide 
guidance just for the upcoming quarter. 

guiding to a growth in OpEx on a year
-
over
-
year basis that is similar to what 

bviously 
feel good about the business during the December quarter. Our revenue 
exceeded in terms of growth, our growth in operating expenses. There's 
going to be quarters where the opposite is going to happen. Our expense to 
revenue ratio during the Decemb
er quarter was that 7.4%. It was the lowest 

had. But obviously we are investing in the business and we will never under 
invest in the business.
 
The majority of the increase will cont
inue to come from R&D, given the fact 

the time ahead of the revenue that would be generated in the future. We 

e

places and we continue to open new retail stores around the world. And so 
the idea for us is to continue to invest in the business, making the right 
trade
-
offs and the results from the
 
December quarter give us very good 
confidence for the future.

Bill Shope
 
I wanted to follow up on your previous comments on the iPhone and the 
custome
r composition for the quarter. Considering the iPhone 6 Plus brought 
you into entirely new segment of smartphone market, can you give us a bit 
more color on that customer composition for this device? Specifically you 
mentioned the differences in geographic
 
adoption, but how about on the 
Android switcher comments you made earlier, and first time adopters 
relative to the traditional iPhone 6 and your other iPhone models in the past. 
And I guess related to that, what do you think this tells you about your ASP 
and unit opportunity for growth in 2015?
 
Tim Cook
 

research in from all of the people that bought last quarter. But in the 
aggregate, as I've mentioned before, we saw more new cus
tomers to iPhone 
than we had ever seen before. And we had a higher rate of Android 


whether it's something we're l
ooking at. And so between the switchers and 
the people that are just new to smartphones and selected an iPhone, and 


of us.
 
Bill Shope
 
Makes sense. And then a follow up on your Apple Pay commentary. When we 
look at the opportunity outside of the U.S. are there unique hurdles we 
should consider as we think about the timing of the rollouts in Europe and 
Asia, or is it real
ly just about following partnerships together?
 
Tim Cook
 
Each has a different implementation. And so in some ways, like there is a 
different set of carriers in every country, there is a different set of banks. In 
a lot of the countries, some of the processe
s with the merchants are 

to country to country and so there's clearly heavy lifting involved to scale.

ewing it as a big opportunity.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal 
Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this 
time for opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn the call over 
to Ms. Nancy 
Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, 
ma'am.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. 
Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he'll be joined by 
Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Trea
surer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with 
the analysts.
 
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion 
today will consist of forward
-
looking statements, including, without 
limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, 
operating expenses, 
other income and expense, stock
-
based compensation expense, taxes, 
earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ 
materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk 
factors discus
sed in Apple's Form 10
-
K for 2010, the Form 10
-
Q for the first 
quarter of fiscal 2011 and the Form 8
-
K filed with the SEC today along with 
the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any 
forward
-
looking statements or information which
 
speak as of their respective 
date.
 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for 
introductory remarks.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report 
the highest March quarter r
evenue and earnings in Apple's history. We set a 
new all
-
time quarterly record for iPhone sales, and a new March quarter 
record for Mac sales, and we're thrilled with the momentum for iPad.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $24.7 billion, which was $11.2 billion
 
over the 
prior March quarter's result and represents the largest year
-
over
-
year 
quarterly revenue growth we've ever generated. This tremendous increase 
of 83% was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, very robust demand for 
iPad and strong growth in Ma
c sales. Operating margin was an all
-
time high 
of almost $7.9 billion, representing 31.9% of revenue. Net income was 
almost $6 billion. This represented 95% growth over the year gross 
quarter's earnings and translated to earnings per share of $6.40.
 
Turnin
g to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products 
and services. We established a new March quarter record with sales of 3.76 
million Macs, representing 28% growth over the year ago quarter. We're 
extremely pleased with this very stro
ng growth, particularly given IDC's 
most recently published estimate of a 3% contraction for the PC market 
overall. This result makes the March quarter the 20th consecutive quarter 
that we outperformed the PC market. We experienced strong Mac sales 
growth 
in each of our operating segments, most notably in the Asia
-
Pacific 
segment, where Mac sales increased 76% year
-
over
-
year. The growth in 
Mac sales was fueled primarily by the continued great popularity of MacBook 
Air, which was updated in the December quar
ter, as well as very strong 
sales of MacBook Pro. We updated the entire MacBook Pro family during the 
March quarter with the next
-
generation processors and graphics, high
-
speed 
Thunderbolt I/O technology and a new FaceTime HD camera.
 
The new MacBook Pro li
neup offers twice the speed of the previous 
generation and customer response has been excellent. We began at the end 
of the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory. During 
the quarter, we released the developer preview of Mac OS X Lion,
 
which 
takes some of the best ideas from the iPad and brings them back to the Mac. 
Lion features Mission Control an innovative new view of everything running 
on the Mac. Launchpad, a new home for all your Mac Apps, full screen apps 
that use the entire Mac 
display and new multi
-
touch gestures. Lion is 
scheduled to ship to customers this summer and we look forward to showing 
more of its great features at our Developers Conference in June.
 
Moving to our music products. We sold 9 million iPods compared to 10.9 
million in the year ago quarter. Though lower year
-
over
-
year, total iPod 
sales were ahead of our expectations with iPod touch continuing to count for 
over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players 
remains at over 70% based on th
e latest monthly data published by MPD, 
and iPod continue to be the top
-
selling MP3 player in most countries we 
track based on the latest data published by GFK.
 
We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod 
channel inventory. The iTu
nes Store turned in its best quarter ever with 
revenue of almost $1.4 billion, thanks to record revenue from music, video, 
iOS apps and books. We were very pleased to begin offering a full catalog of 
17,000 ebooks from Random House on the iBookstore during
 
the March 
quarter. The iBookstore now includes ebooks for more than 2,500 publishers 
in over 20 categories, and customers have downloaded over 100 million 
books.
 
I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold a record 
18.6 million iPhon
es compared to 8.8 million in the previous March quarter. 
This represents 113% year
-
over
-
year growth which is significantly ahead of 
IDC's latest published estimate of 74% growth for the global smartphone 
market overall in the March quarter. Recognized rev
enue from iPhone 
handset and accessory sales was $12.3 billion during the quarter compared 
to $5.45 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 126%. We continue 
to experience very strong year
-
over
-
year iPhone sales growth in all of our 
operating segme
nts with sales in both the Americas and Asia
-
Pacific regions 
more than doubling year
-
over
-
year.
 
We were able to make a significant increase in our capacity, once again, 
allowing us to expand distribution and get much
-
needed supply to our 
channel partners. 
We were very pleased to begin selling iPhones on the 
Verizon network in the U.S. in the March quarter, and we were also happy to 
add SK Telecom in Korea, as well as Saudi Telecom in Saudi Arabia. 
Including some carrier consolidation, we ended the quarter w
ith iPhone 
distribution through 186 carriers in 90 countries.
 
We ended the quarter with about 5.2 million iPhones in channel inventory, a 
sequential increase of about 1.7 million to support new carrier launches and 
existing channel partners. This placed us
 
within our target range of 4 to 6 
weeks of iPhone channel inventory. iPhone is continuing to see strong 
growth within the Enterprise segment. Today, 88% of the Fortune 500 are 
testing or deploying iPhone.
 
With strong employee demand and custom app develop
ment fueling 
adoption, we are seeing great scale of iPhone deployments in businesses 
worldwide. In fact, hundreds of private and public companies worldwide are 
supporting thousands of iPhones on their corporate networks. Some 
examples include Cisco, Pruden
tial, Boston Scientific, General Motors, 
American Airlines, Deloitte, Yum! Brands and Xerox.
 
Turning to iPad, we continue to be thrilled with its momentum. We sold 4.7 
million iPads during the March quarter, launching iPad 2 in U.S. on March 11 
and in 25 a
dditional countries on March 25. Customer enthusiasm has been 
tremendous for iPad 2 and we're working hard to get it into the hands of 
customers as quickly as possible.
 
Including both the original iPad and iPad 2, we had distribution in 59 
countries by the
 
end of the March quarter. Given the very strong customer 
demand and despite the increased geographic distribution, iPod (sic) [iPad] 
channel inventory declined by 400,000 from the beginning of the quarter, 
implying sell
-
through of about 5.1 million. This 
resulted in ending channel 
inventory of below 850,000, which was below our target range of 4 to 6 
weeks. We sold every iPad 2 that we could make during the quarter and 
would have liked to end the quarter with more channel inventory. 
Recognized revenue from
 
sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the 
quarter was $2.8 billion.
 
Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong and 
CIOs continue to embrace iPad in an unprecedented rate. In just over a year 
since its debut, 75% of the Fortun
e 500 are testing or deploying iPad within 
their enterprises. Some recent examples of enterprises that are deploying 
iPad include FORTUNE 500 companies such as Xerox, AutoNation, Yum! 
Brands, ADP, Boston Scientific, Estée Lauder, Disney, Stryker, Prudentia
l 
Financial, Rite Aid and USAA.
 
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached just under 189 million 
cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the March quarter. In March, 
we introduced iOS 4.3 with new features including faster Safari mobile 
brow
sing performance with the Java Nitro script engine, iTunes Home 
Sharing, enhancements to AirPlay and the Personal Hotspot feature for 
sharing an iPhone 4 cellular data connection over Wi
-
Fi.
 
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 350
,000 apps 
available and well over 10 billion downloads to date. In February, we 
announced a new subscription service available to all publishers of content
-
based apps, including magazines, newspapers, video and music. Publishers 
set the price and length of
 
subscription and customers select the 
subscription and length they want with 1 click. And it was also a great 
pleasure to announce in March that we have made more than $2 billion in 
payments to developers since opening the App Store.
 
I'd now like to turn 
to the Apple Retail Stores. We are approaching the Retail 
Stores 10th anniversary on May 19, and we're on the verge of achieving a 
major milestone. In the next few days, we will be thrilled to welcome our 1 
billionth visitor. Store traffic continues to be 
amazingly strong. And in the 
March quarter, we hosted a record 71.1 million visitors in our stores 
compared to 47 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 51%.
 
Retail revenue was $3.19 billion compared to $1.68 billion in the year ago 
quart
er, an increase of 90%. Capitalizing on the February MacBook Pro 
update, the stores delivered another record Mac quarter, selling 797,000 
Macs compared to 606,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 
32%, and about half the Macs sold in our stores 
during the March quarter 
were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.
 
To further enrich our Apple retail customer experience, we recently launched 
a program called Personal Setup. When customers buy a Mac, iPad, iPhone 
or iPod touch, our teams help 
the customer set up the product in the store 
so that they are up and running before they leave. Personal Setup includes 
the customer's e
-
mail, contacts, calendar, applications and more. In the 
March quarter, our stores set up over 1 million products. We op
erated 323 
stores during the quarter. Average revenue per store was $9.9 million 
compared to $5.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 67%. 
International retail store sales remain strong with our average international 
store volume exceeding our 
very productive average U.S. store volume.
 
Retail segment margin more than doubled year
-
over
-
year to $807 million 
compared to $373 million in the year ago quarter. We anticipate opening 40 
new stores in fiscal 2011, nearly 3 quarters of which will be outsi
de the 
United States, including our fifth store in China.
 
Total company gross margin was 41.4%, which was 290 basis points higher 
than our guidance. More than half of this difference came from better 
product mix than planned, particularly higher iPhone sal
es. The remainder 
was largely a result of leverage on the higher revenue and lower
-
than
-
expected commodity, service and other costs.
 
Operating expenses were $2.34 billion and included $236 million of stock
-
based compensation expense. OI&E was $26 million a
nd the tax rate for the 
quarter was 24.2%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to changes in our full 
year forecast of foreign earnings, R&D tax credit and state taxes.
 
Turning to cash. Our cash for short
-
term and long
-
term marketable 
securities totaled 
$65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to 
$59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of 
$6.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $6.2 billion, an increase of 167% 
year
-
over
-
year. The increase in cash is net o
f approximately $900 million to 
combine prepayments and capital expenditures related to the strategic 
supply agreements that we referred to in our last quarterly call.
 
As we move into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which 
includes the typ
es of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred to at 
the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion 
compared to $15.7 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross 
margin to be about 38%, reflecting approximately $55 m
illion related to 
stock
-
based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.5 
billion, including about $255 million related to stock
-
based compensation 
expense. We expect OI&E to be about $70 million and we expect the tax 
rate to be about 25%. We are
 
targeting EPS of about $5.03.
 
In closing, we're thrilled with the results and accomplishments of our record 
March quarter. We're extremely pleased with customers' response to iPad 2 
and are working hard to get it into the hands of customers as fast as we 
can. 
We remain very confident in our strategy and are very excited about our 
new product pipeline.
 
And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Okay, great. Thanks. Can you comment, Peter, on wh
ether or not you're 
seeing any supply chain disruptions from the recent earthquake in Japan. 
And if so, how should we think about that in terms of that being factored in 
your guidance?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Bill, this is Tim. Let me sort of step back and talk about
 
Japan in general and 
sort of try to get all of your questions in advance. First of all, this is an 
incredible tragedy and our hearts go out to everyone involved. Apple, as a 
company, has a very long history and has many strong ties to people in 
Japan, and
 
we're very, very saddened by the situation, and we've 
undertaken various actions to assist in the relief effort. The economic impact 
that we'll address today pales in comparison to the human impact. 
Regarding our business in Japan, we had some revenue imp
act in Q2 but it 
was not material to Apple's consolidated results. We believe revenues will be 
approximately $200 million less in Q3, and this has been factored into the 
guidance that Peter provided you earlier in his comments. Regarding our 
global supply 
chain, as a result of outstanding teamwork and unprecedented 
resilience of our partners, we did not have any supply or cost impact in our 
fiscal Q2 as a result of the tragedy, and we currently do not anticipate any 
material supply or cost impact in our fis
cal Q3. To provide a bit more color 
on this, we sourced hundreds, literally hundreds of items from Japan, and 
they range from components such as LCDs, optical drives, NAND Flash and 
DRAM to base materials such as resins, coatings and foil that are part of 
the 
production process at several layers back in the supply chain. The 
earthquake and subsequent tsunami and the associated nuclear crisis caused 
disruption for many of these suppliers, and many unaffected suppliers have 
been impacted by power interruption
s. But since the disaster, Apple 
employees have literally been working around the clock with our supplier 
partners in Japan, and have been able to implement a number of 
contingency plans. Our preference from the beginning of this tragedy has 
been to remain
 
with our long
-
term partners in Japan. And I have to say, 
they have displayed an incredible resilience that I personally never seen 
before in the aftermath of this disaster. So while we do not anticipate 
--
 
currently anticipate any material impact to our c
omponent supply or cost in 
our fiscal Q3, we do need to caution everyone that the situation remains 
unpredictable given recent aftershocks, the uncertainty about the nuclear 
plant and potential power interruptions. Further, there are some supply risks 
that
 
are beyond the current quarter. And although we know of no issue 
today that we view as unsolvable, the situation is still uncertain and there's 
obviously no guarantees. For this reason, it's difficult to predict whether the 
issues created by the tragedy w
ould impact revenues beyond Q3. However, 
I'll be happy to address Q4 on our next call in July.

Okay, great. That was very helpful. I guess digging into another area of 
supply, looking at your iPad 2 constraints since l
aunch in March, can you 
give us some color on where the constraints lie and how you're doing in 
terms of getting supply back in line with demand?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Well, the demand on iPad 2 has been staggering. And we're still amazed that 
we are still heavily 
backlogged not only at the end of the quarter but also up 
to date. However, I can tell you that I'm extremely pleased with the 
progress of the manufacturing ramp, and we were so confident that we 
rolled out to 25 additional countries at the end of last mon
th. And we are 
shipping to an additional 13 countries next week, and we're planning to add 
even more countries through the quarter. And so I'm very confident that we 
can produce a very large number of iPads for the quarter.

Okay, great. Thanks. I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on what 
drove the iPhone's strength in the quarter? If you could, by r
egion or carrier, 
you mentioned that you added SK Telecom, and I'm not sure if shipments 
there were material during the quarter. And then, Peter, the follow
-
up to 
that I guess is, how do we think about iPhone seasonality going into the 
June quarter giving 
all of the moving parts? We have a full quarter of 
Verizon. In the June quarter, you've got some potential carrier expansion 
benefit and yet, you have a product refresh hopefully coming midyear, so I 
was hoping you could help us think about that a little b
it for the June 
quarter. Thanks.
 
Timothy Cook
 
Rich, it's Tim. In terms of iPhone, we did actually very well everywhere. I'd 
call out 2 places that 
--
 
where it was just off the charts. The U.S. grew 
155% year
-
over
-
year, obviously, adding Verizon and beginni
ng to offer 
iPhone to their enormous customer base was key in that. However, as you 
heard from AT&T's announcement this morning, AT&T did extremely well 
during the quarter. So the U.S. as a geography grew at 155% and that's 
about 3x IDC's forecast of growt
h for the smartphone market, which was 
about 48%. Also, we continued to be on a tear in China. Greater China saw 
iPhone sales being up over 3x, about 200 
--
 
almost 250%. And this 
catapulted revenue for the first half or first fiscal half in Greater China t
o just 
under $5 billion, which is up almost 4x year
-
over
-
year. And so we're 
extremely happy with how we're doing in China.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Rich, and to hit the second part of your question. As I commented in my 
prepared remarks, we were able to increase 
the iPhone channel inventory by 
just over 1.7 million units in the March quarter, and we ended within our 
target, 4 to 6 week range of inventory. In terms of the June quarter, I would 
expect to see a significant year
-
over
-
year increase in sales.
 
Richard Ga
rdner

And any comment on the sequential, Peter?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
No, I think I'll leave it at year

over

significantly.

Yes, thank you. Just following on the iPhone discussion, what, if anything, 
did you learn about the price elasticity curve for the iPhone with the $49

rice point in the market this quarter?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Katy, it was very popular. It did very, very well.
 
Katy Huberty

And then also from the perspective of some positive feedback on LTE phones 
that are out from your competitors, how do you t
hink about the maturity of 
those networks and Apple's sense of urgency to get products out for those 
faster networks? And what if any bottlenecks exist?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I was asked this question or a similar question when we launched the iPhone 
with Verizon. 
And what I've said then, and I still see it as being the case 
today, and I think you can see this in the products that have been shipped, 
is that the first generation of LTE chipsets force a lot of design compromises 
with the handset, and some of those, we
 
are just not willing to make. And so 
we are extremely happy with the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS. And hitting 
18.6 million units was something much larger than we thought we could do 
this quarter, and we're happy to have gotten it out to 3 more large carr
iers.

Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much. Could you talk a bit about the international 
penetration of Macs? Just perhaps, I don't know, Tim, comp
aring your 
adoption curve in the U.S. to where we are internationally, and if there's any 
difference in terms of the type of computers that your customers are 
purchasing internationally?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Yes, if you look at it, Shannon, the growth on the Mac h
as been enormous in 
Asia. The last quarter, we were up 76% in Asia
-
Pacific. And yes, this is many 
multiples of the growth that the 
--
 
that region is seeing for the market. I 
believe the IDC forecast is around 6%. And so we're seeing enormous 
growth in the 
Mac there. Japan also did quite well on the Mac for the 
quarter, and the U.S. had a surprisingly strong quarter in the Mac with being 
up around 
--
 
Americas is up 25%. The U.S. was up just slightly higher than 
that. Our market share is obviously less outsid
e the U.S. in most places than 
it is in the U.S., and so I think that speaks very, very well to the opportunity 
that the Mac has. We've now had 20 quarters in a row where we've 
outgrown the PC market and the momentum is still there. And we seem to 
be the o
nly guys that are really focused on building innovative products in 
that space.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you. Has there been any difference between sort of portable versus 
desktop purchases internationally, or is it sort of trending in line with what 
you've seen in the U.S.?
 
Timothy Cook
 
There are several of the international countries that are extremely portable 
focused. And you can see that we had enormous growth in our portables for 
the quarter. However, part of that is that we had a launch of the n
ew 
MacBook Pro line. But honestly, I see popularity in both the iMac and the 
portable factor, and believe there is a great future for both of them.

Peter: Could you talk a little bit about the forces impacting your sequential 
decline and gross margins by, call it, 350 basis points? What are the forces 
that you're 
--
 
want to call out and things that
 
we should be thinking about? 
Thank you.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. Sequential decline is primarily being driven by the higher mix of iPad 
sales, which, as you know, we priced very aggressively to capitalize on our 
first mover advantage. Additionally, we woul
d expect to lose some leverage 
from the lower sequential revenue. And as I pointed out in my prepared 
remarks in a moment ago, the iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.7 
million units in the March quarter. It acts within our 4 to 6 week range. 
Conversel
y, the iPad channel inventory fell by 400,000 units, and we were 
below our 4 to 6 week inventory range. So those are the forces I would 
highlight.
 
Keith Bachman

BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
Okay. And then perhaps 1 for Tim on my follow
-
up related to Shannon'
s 
question, how are you seeing different opportunities in the large enterprises 
with your MacBook in traditional markets of U.S. and Western Europe, given 
the seemingly greater receptiveness towards your iPhones, and what will be 
the tablets, I think. In o
ther words, is that opening doors to go ahead and 
get the Macs in with CIOs?
 
Timothy Cook
 
It clearly seems to be creating a halo effect for the Mac. And I think that's 1 
reason we see the growth that we are seeing on the Mac. It's amazing when 
you see the 
28% year
-
over
-
year versus the worldwide market in PCs 
contracting by 3 points. It's an astonishing delta.

would change that as we move throughout the year or at least 
into the June 
quarter?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. Ben, it's Peter. For competitive reasons, I don't want to provide any 
more precise ASPs for either of these products. We just don't want to help 
our competitors. But on the data summary, we provide you both th
e iPhone 
and iPad units that we shipped and revenues, which include the accessories 
that you can make your own estimate.
 
Benjamin Reitzes

Barclays Capital
 
Okay. And I guess my other question was with regard to the iPad 
constraints. When do you think 
that you'll be to equilibrium or have channel 
inventory where you need it to be? You were able to say that you increased 
production a lot for the iPhone. When can you say at least the same thing for 
the iPad where you feel like you've alleviated your short
age?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Ben, what I would say is this, I am confident we're going to produce a very 
large number for the quarter. Whether that will be enough to meet demand, 
I don't know. Demand has been staggering. I'm not going to predict when 
supply and deman
d will come into balance. I can only be confident on the 
supply side.

Tim, can you maybe talk a little bit about the CDMA phone and 
maybe specifically, which new markets you're looking at entering with CDMA 
over the next couple of quarters? And then with regards to the facility 
investments, can you maybe talk about the magni
tude of spending you 
expect as you go through the year on 
--
 
with the partners, I mean, sort of in 
investments both on a CapEx side that you're making as well as overall 
investments? Thanks.
 
Timothy Cook
 
On the carrier side, I don't want to get into specif
ics about the CDMA or GSM 
for that matter. But we are constantly looking at where we should bring on 
incremental partners. And as we have said earlier, we brought on 3 this 
quarter, 3 large ones with Verizon, SKT and Saudi Telecom. That's on top of 
the one
s that we brought on in December where we added O2 and Vodafone 
in Germany. And so we are constantly looking and adding where it makes 
sense, and you can keep confidence that we'll continue to do that.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Scott, on your capital question, a c
ouple of updates. We expect to spend in 
our fiscal '11 about $5.7 billion in capital expenditures. That's unchanged 
from what we told you last quarter. We expect about $700 million of that to 
be in our retail area and $5 billion outside of retail. Some of 
the bigger areas 
outside of retail and the biggest is in the operations area. We talked about 
on the last call arrangements we had done with 3 suppliers. We expect to 
spend about $3.5 billion during fiscal '11 and fiscal '12 with those 3 suppliers 
on those
 
deals in the form of prepayments and capital expenditures. And as 
I said in my prepared comments, we expected $900 million of that in the 
March quarter, and we expect to spend the remainder across fiscal '11 and 
fiscal '12.

Yes, thanks very much. It may not be a perfect analogy but just wondering 
with the rise of Android, what might be some of the similari
ties and 
differences you see versus the rise of Windows PCs in the 1990s versus Mac? 
And I'm just wondering if you think in the U.S., particularly Android, could 
become a possible headwind to your U.S. smartphone business, and how do 
you maintain such incr
edible growth in the space of that shift?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I think, Mike, I just saw yesterday 
--
 
it's interesting you should point out the 
U.S. The comScore data released yesterday reported that the iOS platform 
outreaches Android by 59% in the U.S., and so t
his is an enormous 
percentage. On a worldwide basis, we just did 18.6 million iPhones, which is 
up 113%, which is materially faster than the market rate of growth. And we 
launched the iPad 2 and sold everyone of them that we could make. As 
we've said befor
e, we're gaining traction in Enterprise on both the iPhone 
and iPad with astonishing 88% and 75%, respectively, of the Fortune 500 
companies deploying or testing these. We've got the largest App Store with 
over 350,000 apps for iPhone and over 65,000 iPad
-
specific apps on iOS 
versus what appears to be fewer than 100 on Android. And so we feel very, 
very good about where we are and we feel great about our future product 
plan. We've also paid over $2 billion to developers, and we've had well over 
10 billion a
pplications downloaded. And so our business proposition is very, 
very strong. And as we've said before, we continue to believe and even more 
and more everyday that iPhone's integrated approach is materially better 
than Android's fragmented approach, where 
you have multiple OSs on 
multiple devices with different screen resolutions and multiple app stores 
with different roles, payment methods and update strategies. I think the 
user appreciates that Apple can take full responsibility for their experience, 
wher
eas the fragmented approach turns the customer into a systems 
integrator and few customers that I know want to be a systems integrator.

And a question first on the iPhone. Demand, obviously, has been 
phenomenal. And if we look down the road at the opportunity in the post
-
 
versus the prepaid markets, are there 
any considerations that you can share 
in terms of 
--
 
that you weigh, in terms of price or subsidies or growing 
market share in this large prepaid market?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Gene, it's Tim. Our focus has very much been on China. We wanted to 
understand that marke
t and understand the levers there. And as I said 
before, we're 
--
 
iPhone sales were up over 3x during the quarter. And in the 
first half, we did over 5 
--
 
just slightly under $5 billion in Greater China in 
revenue, which is about 10% of Apple, to put it in
 
perspective. And it wasn't 
but a couple of years ago that, that number would have been less than 2. 
And so it's a sea change. And that's certainly not, what I would call, a classic 
post
-
pay market by any means of the imagination. And so we have some 
ideas
 
about other countries as well. I'm not in a position that I want to share 
those today. But we purposely put the bulk of our emphasis from an 
emerging market point of view on China to really learn, and then we're going 
to take that learning to other market
s.

Would you know if China, if more than half of

I wanted to revisit the supply question on bot
h iPhone and iPad. So last 
quarter, you were chasing iPhone demand, and you said you're going to 
work as hard as possible to try and make sure you catch up with your 
demand, and given the inventory build, it sounds like you're comfortable and 
you've gotten
 
there. On the iPad side, it's a little less clear to me. You made, 
I guess, over 7 million iPads in last quarter in fiscal Q1. This quarter, 
including the inventory drawdown, maybe there were 5.1 million made. So 
was this 
--
 
I mean, you've proven that you
 
have the capacity or the 
relationships to build a lot more. Was this simply a forecasting error on the 
iPad side? And can you comment about linearity of demand and why you 
couldn't have kept production at a similar rate to the prior quarter and been 
able 
to fulfill a lot more?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Let me mention a few things for you to consider, Toni. First off, product 
transitions are never simple. And as you can probably appreciate, we are in 
a position that we have to call them for many, many weeks in advance i
n 
terms of how many of the current product we want to produce and the dates 
at which we will announce the new product. We drew the channel down on 
the current product or the original iPad, I should say, by 570,000 units 
during the quarter. And we added at 
the end of the quarter 170,000 of the 
new iPad 2s although most of that was in transit at the end of the quarter. 
And so the net reduction was $400,000. And so our sell
-
through was above 
$5 million for the quarter. And again, this has to be planned quite a
 
ways in 
the future. I think the key point here is 
--
 
also the dates, just to remind you, 
we set out an invitation to the event toward the end of February. We had the 
event in early March. We placed the unit on sale in the United States on 
March 11 and our
 
quarter ended about 2 weeks thereafter. And so there was 
some expectation of a new product, and we would have obviously factored 
that into our thinking about the product transition as we plan the number of 
the original unit to build. And so I think the ke
y point here is that I'm 
extremely pleased with the progress that we were making on the 
manufacturing ramp. We have gotten off to a materially better start and 
produced a lot more units than we did on the original ramp of the first iPad. 
And when we're so 
confident with our ability to supply that we've already put 
on 25 additional countries at the end of March, and we'll be placing on 13 
more next week and we'll do even more as we stepped through the quarter.
 
Toni Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., In
c.
 
Okay. That's helpful. If I could turn to another topic, which is just your 
overall guidance for next quarter on the revenue and EPS side. If I look back 
at your last 8 quarters, Q2 to Q3, last 8 years. 7 of the 8, you've been flat to 
up in revenues. And
 
8 out of 8, you've been up in EPS sequentially from Q2 
to Q3. On both those metrics, you're providing guidance that is dramatically 
down double digits. Can you comment on forces at work? Obviously, you're 
typically pretty conservative in your guidance. Bu
t what are the things that 
are kind of underpinning those directionally, those assumptions, particularly 
since you're pointing to a dramatic increase in iPads?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. Toni, it's Peter. Let me start with top line. I would highlight 2 
things. 
First of all, our sequential revenue guidance of $23 million is for a 7% 
decline, and it have been up in prior years. And 2 things to point out: first of 
all, in our most recent March quarter, we were able to increase the iPhone 
channel inventory b
y 1.7 million units and within our target range. And that 
had not occurred in any of the prior years. And second, last year, we 
launched the iPad in the year ago June quarter, and it was a fabulous launch 
contributing $2.2 billion in revenue without a comp
arison to the prior March 
quarter, and we obviously have that comparison this year. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, I am very pleased we're providing revenue guidance for growth 
of 46% year
-
over
-
year and EPS growing almost as quickly at 43%.

up on the iPad question. Can you give us a

We purposely aren't giving that because we don't want to help out any of

more iPad 2s becaus
e there were certainly a lot of people waiting for them.

Secondly, the follow
-
up on the sequential revenue guidance question. Can 
you provide any color what you expect from Macs, particularly as we enter

ying season? Have you seen any pressure on school 
budgets that is creating a little caution with respect to your Mac business?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
It's a difficult funding environment for schools here in the U.S. We don't see 
any evidence of a share loss. An
d Macs are very of popular in schools and 
iPads are proving to be as well. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, we would expect 
to see a sequential 
--
 
I'm sorry, a year
-
over
-
year very significant increase in 
Mac sales, and I'm very confident about the product lines 
as we head into 
the back

to

school season.
 
Timothy Cook
 
1 thing I would add to that, this was surprising to me and I think several 
people here is, K
-
12 is sort of even more conservative than Enterprise on 
adopting new technology. And last quarter, we were 
about a 1:1 ratio of 
iPads to Macs, which is I think very 
--
 
is amazing with the short life of the 
iPad, and really demonstrates what kind of opportunity there probably is 
there.

demand balance virtually everywhere. The other 
products, the Mac is in
 
supply
-
demand balance and the iPod is in supply
-
demand balance. And the iPad has the mother of all backlogs that we're 
working very, very hard to get out to customers as quickly as we can.

Thanks. Just going back to the supply stuff real quick. Can you clarify 
--
 
would it require some kind of new 
disruption to cause problems beyond fiscal 
Q3, or were your comments just that we could kind of run low on inventory, 
and if production doesn't get back to full capacity, there could be issues later 
in the year?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Sorry, I wasn't trying to be un
clear. I'm saying that as of today, we currently 
do not anticipate any material supply or cost, in fact, as far as that goes in 
our fiscal Q3. That's the quarter that we're in now that ends in June. Beyond 
June, there are risks but there's no issue that we
're aware of today that we 
view as unsolvable. However, new things could happen and I'm sure you've 
been paying attention to the news. There's aftershocks, there's still 
uncertainty about the nuclear plant, there's power interruptions. If that 
stayed at th
e level it is today, I'm not as worried. I would worry if something 
happened and took a turn for the worse. And obviously, I can't predict that 
and certainly hope that it does not occur.

Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
 
Okay, that's really 
helpful. Thanks. And then just on the iPhone, you talked a 
lot about the number of new Mac customers every quarter. Can you give us 
any help on what the mix is of replacement sales versus new customers, or 
what your total user base is there?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I
t's a number that we haven't given out before, and so it's a number that we 
hold tight to the best.

Thanks for having me on. Just 2 quick ones. Just back on components, it 
seems if you look at other vendors and spot pricing, component pricing has 
actually been increasing. I just wanted a little more color why Apple has 
been able to beat t
hat. I know you're a very well
-
run company, obviously. 
Just a little more color on that.
 
Timothy Cook
 
Yes, it's a good question, Shaw. Certainly, spot markets have spiked. This is 
particularly true if you follow the NAND Flash and the DRAM markets. 
However
, we do not typically buy in the spot market. And so, for that 
reason, we see very minimal impact. Beyond Q3, I'm saying I'm not sure 
because it's tough to see that far, but for Q3, we feel very good. Companies 
that buy on the spot market would obviously b
e seeing something extremely 
differently than we would.

Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.
 
Okay, thanks for the color on that. And then just on the iPad, in terms of the 
selling model, does it make sense or is there interest in terms of having it 
subsidized by service providers at some point?
 
Timothy Cook
 
The iPad today is subsidized in a few markets. It is subsidized in Korea if 
people sign a 24
-
month contract, it's subsidized in Japan with a 24
-
month 
contract and a couple of European countries. B
ut the vast majority of people 
that are using the iPad on 3G are doing so on a pay
-
as
-
you
-
go plan and no 
commitment plan. And so, yes, carriers can do that but I think many 
customers prefer the pay
-
as
-
you
-
go plan.

UBS Investment Bank
 
Thank you. 2 questions. Last year, when you gave gross margin guidance for 
the fiscal third quarter, I think 
you 
--
 
1 thing you mentioned was a new 
product transition that would impact the gross margins. Just curious if that's 
also a factor. You didn't mention that. And then secondly, if you could just 
talk a little bit about the suit against Samsung. I'm just wo
ndering how that 
might impact anything on your component
-
supply relationship? Thanks.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
I'll take your gross margin question, it's Peter. It's hard for us to comment 
on gross margin changes year
-
over
-
year because we're in different product 
cycles, commodity environments, different mixes and other factors. So I 
prefer just to talk about it sequentially, and I gave you really the biggest 
drivers of the change that we see. We expect to have a sequential increase 
in terms of our mix of iPad sale
s and also expect our revenues to be down 
sequentially a little bit and to lose some leverage. So those are the factors 
that I think are important on a sequential basis for those margin.
 
Timothy Cook
 
And on your question on Samsung, we are Samsung's larges
t customer and 
Samsung is a very valued component supplier to us, and I expect the strong 
relationship will continue. Separately from this, we felt the Mobile 
Communication Division of Samsung had crossed the line. And after trying 
for some time to work th
e issue, we decided we needed to rely on the 
courts.

Yes, thanks. Tim, you mention
ed earlier about the success of the iTunes 
here. Can you talk a little philosophically about what will be [ph] the next to 
really optimize that platform in terms of cloud
-
like capabilities? And then, 
Peter, the question for you is really around the OpEx. H
ow should we think 
about OpEx? Does your guidance already imply that you will have to 
increase some S&M employees to serve these greater region enterprises? Or 
is that already kind of in the model?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
I'll take both your questions. We don't 
talk about what we'll do in the future, 
so I'm quite limited to what we can say about the future of iTunes. We 
operate the most popular store in the world, giving customers a fabulous 
experience. We have the largest libraries and have provided more content
 
to 
more customers than anybody. We're very confident about what we're doing 
and what we will do in the future. I can't take it beyond there. In terms of 
OpEx, we've provided guidance for the June quarter, about $2.5 billion, and 
that includes our thinking
 
for the investment that we're going to make in the 
quarter for the business. We are investing in engineering, in our retail 
stores, we are investing in our indirect distribution, which it would include 
covering the enterprise and the infrastructure invest
ment that we need to 
support the terrific growth that you're seeing from the company. I'm glad 
that we are making good investments that are paying off but also providing 
-
-
 
continuing to provide leverage in the model.

Peter Oppenheimer
 
Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're thrilled to report the 
highest quarterly revenue and ear
nings in Apple history. We also set a new 
all
-
time quarterly record for iPhone and iPad sales and a new June quarter 
record for Mac sales and we're extremely pleased with the momentum of our 
business. Revenue for the quarter was $28.6 billion, representing
 
year
-
over
-
year growth of 82%. This record quarterly revenue topped the previous 
record established in the most recent December quarter by $1.8 billion and 
was almost $13 billion over the year ago quarter's result. The tremendous 
year
-
over
-
year increase wa
s fueled primarily by dramatic growth in iPhone 
and iPad sales in addition to strong growth in Mac sales. Operating margin 
was a record high of $9.4 billion, representing 32.8% of revenue. Net 
income was $7.3 billion, topping the previous quarterly record 
set in the 
December quarter by $1.3 billion.
 
Net income grew even faster than revenue, increasing 125% year
-
over
-
year 
and translated to earnings per share of $7.79. Turning to the details of the 
quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services
. We established 
the new June quarter record with sales of 3.95 million Macs representing a 
14% increase over the year ago quarter's result. This growth is more than 
4x IDCs most recently published forecast of 3% growth for the PC market 
overall. Mac sales
 
were particularly strong in our Asia
-
Pacific segment, 
where we experienced a 57% year
-
over
-
year increase in total Macs sold. We 
generated healthy Mac growth in both desktop and portable categories. In 
May, we updated the iMac with the next
-
generation quad
 
core processors, 
powerful new graphics, high speed portable I/O technology and a new space 
time, HD camera. The growth in Mac portable sales was driven by strong 
sales of MacBook Pro, as well as MacBook Air. We began to enter the quarter 
with between 3 an
d 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.
 
We are very excited to be launching Mac OS X Lion tomorrow. The Lion 
includes more than 250 new features such as a multi
-
touch gestures, system 
wide support for full screen apps, Mission Control, which is an innovative 
v
iew of everything running on your Mac and much more.
 
Moving to our music products. We sold 7.5 million iPods compared to 9.4 
million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our 
expectations and iPod touch continues to account for over half 
of all iPods 
sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% 
based on the latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to 
be the top
-
selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest 
data published by GFK
. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 
6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.
 
The iTunes store generated strong results with revenue of almost $1.4 
billion. iTunes revenue was up 36% year
-
over
-
year, thanks primarily to 
continued strong sales of
 
music, video and apps. With more than 225 million 
accounts, iTunes is the #1 music retailer in the world and customers have 
downloaded more than 15 billion songs today.
 
I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 20.3 
million iPh
ones compared to 8.4 million in the previous June quarter. This 
represents 142% year
-
over
-
year growth, which is more than double IDC's 
latest published estimate of 67% growth for the global smartphone market 
overall in the June quarter. Recognized revenue 
from iPhone handset and 
accessory sales were $13.3 billion during the quarter compared to $5.3 
billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 150%. We continue to 
experience very strong year
-
over
-
year iPhone sales growth in all of our 
operating segments. 
iPhone sales momentum in the Asia
-
Pacific region was 
particularly robust with sales almost quadrupling year
-
over
-
year. We 
continue to increase our overall iPhone manufacturing capacity in the 
quarter. We were pleased to launch a number of new carrier relat
ionships. 
And by the end of the quarter, iPhone was available through 228 carriers in 
105 countries, compared to 186 carriers in 90 countries as of the end of the 
March quarter. We ended the quarter with about 5.9 million iPhones in 
channel inventory, a se
quential increase of about 700,000 to support strong 
iPhone demand, carrier addition and expanded distribution. We remained 
within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
 
iPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enter
prise with 
91% of the Fortune 500 deployed or testing the device, up from 88% last 
quarter. We're also seeing great growth in scale worldwide. Today, 57% of 
Global 500 companies are testing or deploying iPhone, fueled by strong 
employee demand and opportun
ities for custom App development. Some 
examples of Global 500 companies supporting iPhones on their corporate 
networks, include AXA, Credit Agricole, Nestlé, Dow Chemical, 
GlaxoSmithKline, SUPERVALU and Comcast.
 
Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled 
with its incredible momentum. We 
sold a record 9.2 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 3.3 
million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 183%. We were able to 
increase production sequentially by over 4.5 million and we sold every iPad 
we ca
n make. We launched iPad 2 in an additional 36 countries. And 
combining the original iPad and iPad 2, we ended the quarter with 
distribution in a total of 64 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad 
and iPad accessories during the quarter was over 
6 billion, compared to 2.2 
billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 179%. We ended the quarter 
with about 1.05 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of 
about 200,000, which was well below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. 
Today, 
86% of the Fortune 500 are deploying or testing iPad within their 
enterprises, up from 75% last quarter.
 
We are also seeing strong adoption internationally with 47% of Global 500 
companies testing or deploying iPad. In the 15 months since iPad has 
shipped,
 
we've seen iPads used in the enterprise in ways we could have 
never imagined. Companies like Boston Scientific, Xerox and Salesforce.com 
are deploying thousands of iPads and revolutionize in how their sales teams 
engage their customers. iPad is being used
 
inside the country's top hospitals 
like HCA and Cedars
-
Sinai and in retail at Nordstrom and at Esteé Lauder's 
Clinique counters. General Electric, SAP and Standard Charter have 
developed internal Apps for training, currency tracking and business process 
m
anagement to help make employees even more productive. And Alaska 
Airlines and American Airlines are using the iPad in cockpit to replace paper
-
based navigational and reference information pilots carry with him on every 
flight.
 
We continue to be delighted 
by the diverse and sometimes, unexpected use 
cases we see around iPad. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we 
reached over 222 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the 
June quarter.
 
Last month, we provided a preview of iOS 5, which inc
ludes over 200 new 
features such as notification center for viewing and managing notifications 
without interruption, iMessage for sending text messages, photos and videos 
between iOS devices and Newsstand, a new way to purchase an organized 
newspaper and m
agazine subscriptions.
 
With the new PC
-
free feature, iOS 5 users will be able to activate and set up 
iOS devices right out of the box with no computer required. We are looking 
forward to launching iOS 5 this fall.
 
In June, we also provided a preview of iCl
oud, our set of free new services 
that work seamlessly with applications on the customer's iPhone, iPad, iPod 
touch, Mac or PC to automatically and wirelessly store content in the cloud, 
as well as push it to all the users' devices. We think customers will
 
love 
using iCloud and we look forward to its release in the fall.
 
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 425,000 apps 
available in over 15 billion downloads to date. And as we mentioned last 
month, we're extremely pleased to have re
ached over 2.5 billion in 
cumulative payments to iOS developer, far ahead of any of our competitors.
 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which generated record June 
quarter results. Revenue grew to $3.5 billion from $2.6 billion in the year 
ag
o quarter, an increase of 36%. This growth was driven primarily by higher 
volumes of iPad, iPhones and Macs. The store sold 768,000 Macs compared 
to 677,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 13%. And about half 
of the Macs sold in our stores dur
ing the June quarter were to customers 
who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, 
including 2 in France, 1 in the U.K. and 1 in Germany, ending with a total of 
327. With an average of 325 stores open, average revenue per store
 
was 
$10.8 million compared to $9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 
20%. Retail segment margin was $828 million compared to $593 million in 
the year ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted 
73.7 million visitors in th
e June quarter compared to 60.5 million in the year 
ago quarter, an increase of 22%.
 
Our recently launched, personal setup program is off to a great start. 
Customers love this new feature the retail store experience that they're up 
and running with their n
ew products before they leave. During the June 
quarter, we set up over 2 million Macs, iPhone, iPads and iPods collectively.
 
We plan to open 30 new stores in the September quarter, including our first 
store in Hong Kong. That will bring us to a total of 40
 
store openings in fiscal 
2011, including 28 new stores outside United States.
 
Total company gross margin was 41.7%, which was 370 basis points higher 
than our guidance. This difference was a result of 3 approximately equal 
factors: a stronger mix of iPhon
e; lower commodity and other costs, which 
included some one
-
time items; and leverage on the higher revenue. 
Operating expenses were $2.54 billion and included $232 million in stock 
based compensation expense. OI&E was $172 million and the tax rate for 
the 
quarter was 23.5%.
 
Turning to cash. Our cash for short
-
term and long
-
term marketable 
securities totaled $76.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to 
$65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $10.4 
billion. Cash flo
w from operations was $11.1 billion, an increase of 131% 
year
-
over
-
year.
 
I'd now like to talk about the accounting implications of some of the new 
aspects of our products and services. First, when we deliver Mac OS X Lion 
to customers, we are now including
 
the right to receive future unspecified 
minor software upgrades and features when and if they become available for 
both the Mac operating system and our suite of Mac OS allied [ph] 
applications. We will continue to charge for standalone sales of our perio
dic 
major OS upgrades, such as Lion, as well as major upgrades of iLife. 
Revenue from these standalone sales will now be fully deferred at the time 
of sale and recognized over a period of 3 years. In addition to this future 
software upgrade right, Mac cust
omers will have access to iCloud services 
when they become available in the fall. We estimate that the combined value 
of the software upgrade right and iCloud services for Mac customers is $22. 
Therefore, as of June 6, we began deferring $22 of the revenue
 
associated 
with each new Mac sold. And we will recognize these deferred amounts as 
revenue over a period of 4 years.
 
Purchasers of IOS devices will also have access to iCloud. So beginning on 
June 6, we begin to sign a portion of the revenue from each iOS
 
device sold 
to represent the estimated value of the right to receive iCloud services when 
they become available. That deferred amount is in addition to the amount 
that we will already deferring for each iOS device sold to represent the right 
to receive fu
ture iOS software upgrades.
 
As a result, beginning on June 6, we are deferring a total of $16 of revenue 
for each iPhone and iPad sold and a total of $11 for each iPod touch sold and 
recognizing those amounts over a period of 2 years. As we move ahead into
 
the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the 
types of forward
-
looking statements that Nancy referred to at the beginning 
of the call.
 
We expect revenue to be about $25 billion compared to $20.3 billion in the 
September quarter
 
last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38%, 
reflecting approximately $55 million related to stock
-
based compensation 
expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.725 billion, including about $245 
million related to stock
-
based compensation expense.
 
We 
expect OI&E to be about $50 million and we expect the tax rate to be 
about 24%. We are targeting EPS of about $5.50.
 
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record revenue and earnings 
and the tremendous customer response to our products. Through the 
first 3 
quarters of fiscal 2011, we have generated $35 billion in year
-
over
-
year 
revenue growth translating to a 78% increase. At the same time, we have 
generated over $9.5 billion in year
-
over
-
year earnings growth, representing 
a 99% increase. We remain v
ery excited about our new product pipeline and 
we look forward to releasing the Mac OS X Lion tomorrow and bring in the 
wonderful new features of iOS 5 and iCloud to customers this fall. With that, 
I'd like to open the call to questions.

Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with 
Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty

Morgan Stanley
 
The 12% revenue downtick, Peter, in September is much more conservative 
than 
your typical September guidance and what you end up reporting in 
September, which is usually a 20% plus increase for the last 4 years. Can 
you help us understand why you expect this next quarter to trend softer 
than seasonal and maybe how you handicap the 
impact from some of the 
new software services and products that you expect to launch in the 
quarter?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. Let me start with the units and I'll give you some thoughts on 
revenue. For the education
-
buying season, September has historically
 
been 
more weighted to higher education and we would expect this to be the same 
this year. We have the best line
-
up of Macs ever and we'd expect to see a 
year
-
over
-
year increase in sales. We also expect a year
-
over
-
year increase 
in iPhone sales. And for iP
ad, we're continuing to expand our quarterly 
production capacity and point of sale and we'd expect a significant year
-
over
-
year increase in sales. For iPod, we would expect to see a sequential 
year
-
over
-
year decline. As we announced at WWDC, we have a lot 
going on 
in the fall with the introduction of iOS 5 and iCloud. We also have a future 
product transition that we're not going to talk about today and these things 
will impact our September quarter. We remain very confident in our 
business, our new product 
pipeline and our momentum.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Peter, as that relates to future product transitions, can you just remind us 
how you approach working those into your guidance, you tend to be 
conservative and wait and see what happens with those pr
oducts?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Well, as I've said a moment ago, we're not going to talk about this in any 
detail today. We factored our thinking into our guidance. We are incredibly 
confident about our business, our new product pipeline and what we're 
doing.
 
Op
erator
 
From Cross Research, we'll go to Shannon Cross.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Tim, could you talk a bit about iPad 2 sales and trends? It's still relatively 
early I suppose, but I'm curious as to what you're seeing in terms of any 
potential cannibalization or shift
 
of people away from portables, just any 
thoughts you have on the iPad 2?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Yes. Sure, Shannon. In terms of cannibalization, we do believe that some 
customers chose to purchase an iPad instead of the new Mac during the 
quarter, but we also belie
ve that even more customers chose to purchase an 
iPad over Windows PC. And as I've said before, there's a lot more of the 
Windows PC business to cannibalize than the Mac. Also, we believe that the 
Mac has many other attributes that would make it continue t
o do well in the 
market. We're very happy that we grew 14% versus the markets growth of 
2.6%, which is about 5x as Peter said earlier. And so that's what we see with 
iPad. As Peter said earlier, we were still selling every unit we could make 
during the qua
rter and that was the situation as we ended the quarter. As 
we stepped into July over the initial weeks to give you a more current 
update, we had been able to increase the supply further. And some SKUs 
and some countries are at a supply
-
demand balance, but
 
we're still working 
very hard on the balance of the world. The sales of iPad 2 have absolutely 
been a frenzy for people to give one and we feel very good about the 
progress that we've made about ramping up and the reception that it 
received in marketplace
.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Great. And then if you could talk just a little bit about China. Clearly, your 
growth in Asia Pac was at almost 250% year
-
over
-
year, just any update on 
China?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Yes. That's a good question. China was very key to our results. As a
 
reminder, we define Greater China as Mainland China, Hong Kong and 
Taiwan. Year
-
over
-
year, it was up over 6x and the revenue was 
approximately $3.8 billion during the quarter and that makes the year
-
to
-
date numbers through the 3 quarters that we've had th
us far around $8.8 
billion. And so this has been a substantial opportunity for Apple and I firmly 
believe that we're just scratching the surface right now. I think there is an 
incredible opportunity for Apple there.

From Barclays Capital, Benjamin
 
Reitzes.
 
Benjamin Reitzes

I wanted to talk a little bit more about the outlook for gross margin. You said 
38% from the 41.7%. Can you talk about what components and/or mix 
dynamics will impact that, Peter?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. We 
expect the gross margin, Ben as you said, to be about 38% and 
down about 370 basis points sequentially. We expect about 2/3 of this 
decline to be driven by the different product mix and we expect the 
remainder to be due to the loss of leverage on the lower
 
sequential revenue. 
The cost of the future product transition, a full quarter of the back
-
to
-
school 
promotion.
 
Benjamin Reitzes 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
I guess the components aspect of that?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Ben, it's Tim, both NAND and DRAM and also LCDs, batteri
es, optical drives 
and most of the components are generally in a very positive supply situation 
currently. And pricing is expected to fall at or above the historical trend. 
Hard drive supply is currently constrained. We project the price declines in 
this a
rea will be less than the historical rates. We do expect therefore 
components to be favorable on a sequential comparison. However, this is 
largely being offset by one
-
time benefits that we receive that are embedded 
in the 41.7% gross margin that Peter talk
ed about earlier in the June 
quarter. And therefore, not a part of the bridge that Peter just talked about.
 
Operator
 
From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.
 
Bill Shope

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Hopefully, I didn't miss this, but can you give us a 
little more color on that 
one
-
time benefit in gross margins, how significant was it? And any color on 
what drove that?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. Bill, it's Peter. We saw some benefits in our warranty and phone 
support area and some settlements that we had. T
hey weren't huge in the 
June quarter, but we did see some benefits there. And as Tim said, we see 
that generally offsetting, the reversal of that generally offsetting the 
component benefits that he just talked about in the September quarter.
 
Bill Shope

G
oldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Okay. Great. And then a quick follow up. There's been a lot of news around 
patent disputes as of late, some seems to have gone in Apple's favor, while 
others haven't. Can you help us understand, Tim, how to put these events in 
conte
xt? How we should think about your IP strategy overall and perhaps 
how all this is potentially impacting the competitive landscape in 
smartphones and tablets?
 
Timothy Cook
 
We have a very simple view here, and that view is, we love competition. We 
think it'
s great for us and for everyone. But we want people to invent their 
own stuff and we're going to make sure that we defend our portfolio 
perfectly.

Surprised nobody has asked it, but I
 
was just hoping that you could provide 
a little more color on what drove the iPhone's strength in the quarter, was it 
new carriers or existing, new countries or existing? I know you've specifically 
referred to China as being a driver, but just a little mo
re color on what you 
saw with iPhone in the quarter, please?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Yes. Richard, it's Tim. It's a great question. We did add 42 new carriers and 
15 new countries during the quarter, and so we continued our expansion 
efforts to get up beyond the 2.25
 
carrier number and above 100 countries. 
However, those occurred throughout the quarter and the real sequential 
improvement, frankly, was due to emerging and developed markets. China 
was a big part of it, Latin America driven by Brazil and Mexico was a big
 
part 
of it, and the Middle East was a big part of it, which I think is great for Apple 
because these are markets that Apple historically has not been as strong 
and we're really beginning to see the fruits of our labor in these markets.

And then, Tim, would you be willing to give us, as a follow

up, any sort of 
milestones that you're hoping to hit for the next quarter or 2 in terms of new 
carriers and countries for iPhone?
 
Timothy Cook
 
No, but I think you can see that it's so
mething that is of great focus to us. 
We want to do business with great partners and there are still great partners 
out there to do business with, and so we're obviously off working new 
relationships.

The iPhone clearly is gaining share, but comments from Google last week 
just said Android activations were up 56% quarter
-
over
-
quarter and by our 
math, it looks like iOS activations were up around 20%. Tim, you men
tioned 
that China is on fire right now up 600%. Obviously, you're doing relatively 
well in emerging markets but any thoughts in terms of how do you think, I 
guess, about that Android activation number relative to your business?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I think the And
roid activation number is a difficult one to get our hands 
around, because unlike our numbers, which you can kind of go to our data 
sheet and you can add the iPods and the iPads and make a reasonable 
approximation of the iPod touch which spans over half of
 
our iPod sales. You 
can quickly see that in the June quarter that we sold over 33 million iOS 
devices and across time, as Peter mentioned in his opening comments, we 
are now over 222 million cumulative iOS devices. And so we think this is 
incredible. And 
so our numbers are very straight forward, they're 
transparent and they're reported quarterly. In terms of iPhone, iPhone is up 
142% year
-
over
-
year. This is more than 2x the rate of growth of the 
smartphone market. We think that's incredible. Also, as Peter
 
said earlier, 
we sold every iPad 2 in the quarter that we could make and so there 
certainly was not a shortage of demand. We're also gaining traction in 
enterprise. From the numbers that Peter spoke of, obviously, now our 
attention is not turning to getti
ng corporations to test and pilots, but it's 
more 
--
 
was really converted to more of a penetration focus. Our App Store 
is the largest by far and if you look at iPad specific apps, we are over 
100,000. And I think you would be hard
-
pressed to find a little
 
bit of a few 
100 on the other platform. It also doesn't appear that the other tablets are 
getting any traction to speak of, and we've paid over $2.5 billion to 
developers and so there's a great business proposition for developers and 
you can tell the cust
omers about it because we have well over 15 billion 
apps that have been downloaded. And so we're very, very confident of the 
product. We're confident with the App Store. We're confident with our 
proposition for developers. The customer stat in every survey
 
I had seen 
ranks the iPhone #1. And so we're very confident in the customer reception. 
We're also very confident in our roadmap and so we feel very, very good. 
You may have seen the data that just came out, I believe, it was yesterday, 
from ChangeWave tha
t reaffirmed once again that iPhone is the clear leader 
in customer satisfaction and also was the #1 preference to those people 
planning to buy smartphone in the next 90 days. And so it seems like there's 
a lot of great things and we feel absolutely fantas
tic about it.

Okay. Just a follow

up question, any update on Apple TV and maybe some 
thoughts on your strategy in the connected TV markets?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Apple TV continues to do well, but I don't want to mislead. W
e still call it a 
hobby here and we do that because we don't want anyone to conclude that 
it's another leg of the stool because it's not in the same market that iPhone 
is in, or that the iPad is in, or that the Mac is in, or that the iPod is in. And so 
we 
love the product It's clear that customers love the product. We really 
guided right when we went to the new Apple TV just last fall. But right now, 
it's still a hobby status that we're continuing to invest in it because we think 
that there is something the

I just want to touch base here, Tim, on just the scintillating sales velocity. Is 
Apple at a point now where you kind of diversify your contract 
manufacturing bas
e, as well as even your non
-
Apple retail channel? And 
what are the opportunity and risk there?
 
Timothy Cook
 
In terms of the non
-
Apple retail channel, if you take the iPhone as an 
example, which as you know makes up a large percentage of our business, 
we ha
ve about 115,000 points of sale. And so I feel that we're incredibly 
diversified. We're selling through carriers, through retail. We're selling 
through our own stores, through our online store. We're selling through 
companies that have direct sales forces.
 
We are selling to enterprise, 
including an overlay sales force of our own. So I think the channel is 
extremely well
-
diversified. There are still countries, where we're still building 
the channel and so I don't want to give you a view that I think the jour
ney is 
completed, but in the mature markets I feel that the channels are in good 
shape. And in the markets, where we're putting more and more energy, 
obviously, there is still channel development to do there, but I think it's well 
understood and under cont
rol. So as I don't, really, that's not something 
that I worry about at all, actually. In terms of suppliers, I don't want to get 
into this in any detail, because I think this is one of those things for us that 
is the part of the magic and a part of the thi
ngs that we feel that we have 
some secret sauce in and I prefer not to share it. But your general point 
about, are we too centralized in one place, or are we too dependent on a 
place. You can 
--
 
the people hear that are involved in the supply chain, we 
got
 
some outstanding ones, always ask that question and I think we always 
at the end of the day make the right decision for Apple.

Understood. Appreciate that. Maybe just a follow

up for you Tim or Peter. 
You've talked in
 
the past about the iPhone and the iPad 2 just because of the 
leading edge technology that sometimes the manufacturing yield are a little 
lighter than what we all think. Where are you guys now in terms of 
manufacturing yields, have you walked further up th
e curve in terms of 
better utilization?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I don't want to give you a specific yield numbers, but as I've said earlier, the 
supply of iPad improved dramatically in the quarter, that allowed us to do 
the over 9.2 million, that's up from the 4.7 fr
om the prior quarters that we 
added almost 100%. I also said that we had further incurred the supply in 
the initial weeks of July. And that's allowed us to get into a supply
-
demand 
balance on some SKUs and some countries. So I feel very, very good about 
ou
r progress in that area.

Tim, the trajectory of iPhone growth has been nothing less of astounding 
because, now you're 142%. You were 113%, last quarter, 86%. So I'm j
ust 
trying to understand what your thinking is on the keys to sustain that 
growth. Particularly, do you see the current pricing, for example, and tariffs 
perhaps approaching a level, maybe North America saw saturation. Do you 
need to address that? Differen
t form back factors, expanded distribution or 
just stay on the same business model, especially these lower cost Android 
competitors potentially coming from Asia? Can you talk to that?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Well, I think on the tariff side, Apple doesn't set the tar
iffs. So it is set by 
the carrier. And so I think that's a better question for them, but at a very 
macro level, I think what you would find if you went out and talked to 
several around the world is that virtually every one of them are desirous of 
having mo
re and more customer have a smartphone and begin to use data 
on their networks because this is the way for them to expand their ARPUs. 
And I firmly believe there is no better device than the iPhone for someone to 
move from any phone up to a smartphone. So 
ease of use is just 
unparalleled, and the ecosystem is unparallel. And so I think there is a good 
alignment in that area. I mentioned a few moments ago that the key driver 
in our sequential results on the iPhone are sequential improvement in unit, 
we're em
erging and developing market. So you can see that we're putting 
more and more energy in these markets that have been a bit more difficult 
to do well in versus some of the markets that are in the established 
countries and subsidized countries or they're pri
marily subsidizing. So I think 
we have a very good focus here. And I think we can compete with anyone.

So those markets would have prepay, for example, lower purchasing power, 
indirect distribution. Are those things
 
you are going to need to address 
through pricing and other means?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Those markets that I mentioned that we were doing well in, there are some 
percentage of postpaid in some of those markets, but if you looked at the 
market in the 
aggregate, most of those markets are predominantly prepaid. 
In some cases, we've convinced someone to start a postpaid plan because in 
the long term, I think that's better for the customer, the carrier and us. But 
in general, we are also playing in the pre
paid market. We're not avoiding 
that market. We don't want to avoid that market. We know that we need to 
play there in order to have the kind of volumes that we'd like to have. And in 
terms of your question on expanding channels and developing channels, 
we
're obviously that is 
--
 
is on our list and with the 115,000 down now, we 
have some experience there. We know we've got a lot more to do, but we've 
got some experience under our belt now to play with.

Tim, this is for you. Mac growth was about 5% sequential. In the past 2 
years, the sequential growth has looked more like 17% to 18% and 
notebook sequential growth was even below that. So I wanted to 
go back to 
what do you think in this quarter was cannibalization versus perhaps some 
hold
-
backs in anticipation of Lion? And how does that show up you think in 
terms of catch
-
up in the September quarter?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Yes. I really look more at year
-
over
-
ye
ar than I do sequential on the Mac. 
But I am going to get at your 
--
 
the answer to your question anyway. I 
think, first of all, I am proud of the numbers that we achieved. To grow at 
14%, when the market is growing at 2.6%, doing 5x the rate of growth is 
c
ertainly something to be proud of. However, in terms of why isn't the 
number higher than 14%, obviously, we always focus on that. No matter if 
the number was 42%, we would focus on that. I think there are 3 things 
that are the primary factor. And I don't w
ant to try to quantify these for you, 
but I do want to list them and how we look at it. The first is, as I've said 
before, I think there were some cannibalization of new Mac by iPad. We 
shipped a record 9.2 billion iPads during the quarter, which is over 2
x the 
number of Macs that we shipped. And it's clear that some customers chose 
to purchase an iPad instead of a new Mac. But the thing that really excites 
us is that more customers chose to buy an iPad than a Windows PC. The 
second one is, I think, some cu
stomers have delayed purchase until Lion 
becomes available. And as Peter commented on earlier, we are launching 
Lion tomorrow. And we're looking forward to getting Lion out. It's a fantastic 
product. The guys have worked very, very hard on it and it's real
ly a 
revolutionary change. But the third thing that I wouldn't discount it, in the 
year ago quarter, we launched new MacBook Pro. In this particular quarter, 
we launched new iMac. Both products were well received, however, the 
MacBook Pro makes up over the
 
majority of the units that we sell in the Mac 
area. And so obviously, if you change the MacBook Pro and it's well received, 
it's going to make the comp more difficult to compare to. And so those are 
the 3 things that I think are primarily why the number i
sn't more than it is. 
But I don't want to lose site that it is already is 5x the industry and this is 
the 21st consecutive quarter that we beat the market.

My follow
-
up then is if I look at the sequential growth pat
tern in the 
September quarter, I would assume given the demand and as you said, 
you're catching up here in the month of July that iPads would increase 
sequentially, including probably some potential channel fill. But I just want 
to see if you could give us
 
some feedback on what the growth trajectory look 
like after this great quarter here in iPads.
 
Timothy Cook
 
Well, we don't predict unit sales. We aggregate things into a guidance and 
Peter went through that earlier. So I don't want to make a comment about 
iPad other than I think Peter said earlier, which I'm sure that you would 
have reached conclusion of anyways that we think iPad will grow significantly 
year
-
over
-
year. And we'll leave the rest of it to you to conclude and then we 
would be very happy to rep
ort in October how we did that.
 
Operator
 
From Bank of America, we'll go to Scott Craig.
 
Scott Craig
 
Tim, could you maybe provide a bit more color around what exactly the 
issues are for the iPad ramping up into the sort of levels that you want to 
get to? An
d can you hazard a guess as to when you think you'll be at sort of 
equilibrium on a global basis from a production and supply standpoint?
 
Timothy Cook
 
This is a good sort of problem per se is that the demand is fantastic. And so 
there's not something that 
I would point to on a supply side saying that this 
is creating a huge issue, it's the good problem. And as I said before, and I 
generally don't do that, but in this case, I am to talk about July. In the first 
weeks of July, we're now 3 
--
 
a little over 3 w
eeks into the quarter. Supply 
has further improved since we ended our June quarter and that further 
improvement has led some SKUs in some countries to become in supply
-
demand balance. Now, I'm not going to project what will happen to the 
other country, but
 
obviously, we're working very, very hard to get as many 
units to customers as we can. And we placed our latest thinking in the 
guidance obviously.
 
Scott Craig
 
And maybe just a quick follow
-
up, Tim. Is there anything you guys are doing 
differently as far a
s investing in the enterprise sales force, so to speak, or 
doing anything differently as far as going to market on the enterprise side 
that you can point us to? And then, I guess, we'll see the fruits of that labor 
as we sort of go forward here.
 
Timothy Co
ok
 
We have a dual
-
prong strategy with enterprise on both the iPad and the 
iPhone. As we work with the carrier sales forces and they have very large 
ones because they're selling their services into enterprise and many of these 
enterprises want that one of o
ur device is connected to it and so we train 
and provide quite a bit of help to the carrier forces. Plus we do some sales, 
directly our sales or act as an overlay sales force to a channel that sells to 
enterprise. And I would characterize this as we're sti
ll building it out and we 
do a bit better each quarter. We're very, very happy with the numbers that 
Peter talked about earlier about the level of interest and taking people to the 
pilot and initial deployment stages. And now our attention is moving to 
pen
etration within those accounts versus sort of getting on the standards 
lists. And I think you'd really look at it fairly to be this far into the enterprise 
with a product that's only been shipping for 15 months in the case of iPad is 
absolutely incredible,
 
because the enterprise is typically much more 
conservative and takes a long time to evaluate products. In this case, people 
are moving at a speed I haven't seen. Also in a group that's not thought of 
as enterprise like K
-
12, our K
-
12 generally takes a ver
y long time for new 
product categories, but last quarter, we sold more iPads in K
-
12 than we did 
not. And to do that after just 5 quarters is absolutely shocking. We would've 
never predicted that. And so we feel very, very good about the different area 
tha
t iPad is being sold into. It's clear it has a universal appeal in many 
different markets from consumer to business to government and on and on.

We're going to deliver customers just a seamless integrated experience that

Tim, I wanted to revisit China and also prepaid phones. China Mobile 
recently said it has 5.6 million phones on its net 
--
 
iPhones on its network as 
of the end of May, and was adding them at an incredible rate. Obviously, 
China Mobi
le doesn't sell the phone. So that would certainly point to a lot of 
a prepaid phones or unlocked phones on their network. I believe also your 
direct distribution in China for the iPhone, both online and retail stores is in a 
prepaid fashion. So I was wond
ering if you could tell us how significant 
prepaid is in China and other emerging markets, how much progress you've 
made there and what lessons you've learned given that you yourselves are 
also selling them prepaid? And I have a follow
-
up, please.
 
Timothy 
Cook
 
Prepaid or unlocked phones are, said more an English, phones sold without a 
contract are very key in China and very key in a number of the emerging 
markets, where the credit systems are not as well established as they are in 
the U.S., Japan and Wester
n Europe and Australia, et cetera. And so you can 
look at our volume, Toni, that the iPhone volume for the first 3 quarters of 
the fiscal year was up 5x year
-
over
-
year. And iPhone is the key contributor 
to Greater China having a cumulative revenue of aroun
d $8.8 billion for the 
first 3 quarters. And so I am not saying at all that we have figured out 
precisely how to play perfectly in the environment we have and I think we 
have more to do and more to learn. But I feel very, very good about our 
progress. I th
ink if any of us would have been told a year ago that we would 
do $3.8 billion in Greater China in a quarter, I don't think very many of us 
would've believed it. And I don't think any of you would've believed that. 
And so we feel very, very good about it a
nd we're taking those learnings and 
applying those to other markets as well.

If I could follow up, your market share data is pretty irrefutable, and it's 
pretty consistent in terms of your being a share ga
iner. There are parts of 
the world in developed countries like U.K., Germany, France and Japan, 
where some of the recent market data suggests that you've actually lost 
share in iPhones on a year
-
over
-
year basis in Q2. I was wondering if you 
could tell us w
hether gaining share in the smartphone category for iPhone is 
strategically important to Apple longer term, and how we get our minds 
around sustained share gains given that most of the market data says 
smartphones above $300 are going to grow a lot slower 
than the overall 
smartphone market. So how do we: a, are share gains important to Apple in 
this marketplace; and how do we reconcile where you participate in its 
market growth rate relative to the overall market?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Share gain is important anywhe
re where we are going, the opposite way 
then we're not happy. And you can bet that we're working hard to change 
that. In terms of playing in different price points, we do offer the 3GS, as an 
example today, which in the U.S. is $49 with a contract. And if 
you step that 
out into prepaid market, it really depends upon the VAT and duty and 
channel kind of uplifts as to what it is. So it varies greatly market
-
to
-
market. 
But it's clearly, in a distinctly different price than the iPhone 4 is. Our 
philosophy is th
e same as it's always been, Toni. We will only make products 
that we're proud of, that are the best in the world, and if we can do that and 
the price is lower then we're great with that. An example of that, that 
happened some time ago is the iPod shuffle w
as created. It started at a 
different price point, but it's now at $49 and that's because it's a product 
we're very proud of. It's very innovative. A lot of people love that product. 
So that's always the question for us in the litmus test. We will only mak
e 
products that we're very proud of, that we want to own, that are the best in 
the world and regardless of what the price band analysis. Also, as we've 
seen and as I'm reminded time and time again as I look at some of the 
China data is it's up to us to con
vince people to maybe spend a little more 
for a materially better experience of product. And we think that people will 
do that if the product is great and if it's messaged appropriately and we got 
a lot of experience in both of those areas.

respective date. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, 
Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pl
eased to report 
the outstanding results of our December quarter. The performance of our 
business was extremely strong, as we sold more Macs, iPhones and iPads 
than in any previous quarter in Apple's history. And as a result, we're thrilled 
to announce all
-
time record quarterly revenue and earnings.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $26.7 billion, an increase of more than $11 
billion over the prior December quarter's result, representing growth of 71%. 
The robust revenue growth was fueled by record iPhone, iPad an
d Mac sales. 
Operating margin was over $7.8 billion, representing 29.3% of revenue. Net 
income was $6 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings 
record set in the September quarter by $1.7 billion, and represented 78% 
growth over the year
-
ago 
quarter's earnings. These results translated to 
earnings per share of $6.43.
 
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products 
and services. We established a new quarterly record with sales of 4.13 
million Macs, representing 23
% growth over the year
-
ago quarter. That's 
almost 8x IDC's most recently published estimate of 3% growth for the PC 
market. We experienced strong sales growth in each of our geographic 
segments, with over 50% growth in both the Asia
-
Pacific region and Japa
n. 
The growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, 
which was launched in October, as well as continued strong sales of 
MacBook Pro. Customers love the new thin and light unibody design of the 
MacBook Air, and the impressive respon
siveness and reliability of its solid
-
state storage, while MacBook Pro continues to provide customers 
tremendous speed and high
-
performance graphics at an excellent value.
 
We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel 
inventory. We 
opened the Mac App Store in January 6, bringing what we've 
learned from iOS Apps to Mac users to make discovering, installing and 
updating apps easier than ever. The Mac App Store is available in 90 
countries, and features more than 1,000 free and paid app
s in categories 
like education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity and utility. 
We've been very pleased with customer response, with over 1 million 
downloads on the first day alone.
 
Moving to our music products. We sold 19.4 million iPods 
compared to 21 
million in the year
-
ago quarter. We experienced continued strong sales of 
iPod touch, which grew 27% year
-
over
-
year and accounted for over 50% of 
all iPods sold during the quarter. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 
players remains at o
ver 70% based on the latest monthly data published by 
NPD, and iPod continues to be the top
-
selling MP3 player in most countries 
we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We ended the quarter 
within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod c
hannel inventory.
 
The iTunes Store generated another strong quarter with revenue exceeding 
$1.1 billion, thanks to strong sales of music, video and apps. We were 
extremely pleased to bring the legendary music of the Beatles to iTunes 
during the quarter and
 
to introduce movies to the iTunes Store in Japan. And 
as we announced a few weeks ago, iTunes users are now renting and 
purchasing over 400,000 TV episodes and over 150,000 movies per day.
 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold 16.2
 
million 
iPhones compared to 8.7 million in the previous December quarter. This 
represents 86% year
-
over
-
year growth compared to IDC's latest published 
estimate of 70% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the 
December quarter. Recognized reve
nue from iPhone handset and accessory 
sales was $10.47 billion during the quarter, compared to $5.58 billion in the 
year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 88%.
 
The sales value of iPhones alone was over $10.1 billion, which yields an ASP 
of about $625. At the end
 
of the December quarter, we had iPhone 
distributions through 185 carriers in 90 countries. We continue to experience 
very strong year
-
over
-
year growth in all of our segments, with sales in the 
Asia
-
Pacific region and Japan both more than doubling year
-
ove
r
-
year.
 
Enterprise customers continue to embrace iPhone, with 88 of the Fortune 
100 companies and almost 60% of the Financial Times Europe 100 
companies now testing or deploying iPhones. Strong employee demand in 
custom app development are fueling deployme
nt within the corporate sector.
 
Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list 
worldwide. Most recently, Fortune 500, like Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels 
Midland, DuPont, Staples, Starbucks and Genworth Financial, and Global 500 
accounts
 
such as Nissan Motor, BBVA [Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria], 
Standard Chartered Group and Danone, have made iPhone available to their 
employees.
 
We ended the quarter with about 3.5 million iPhones in channel inventory, a 
sequential increase of about 250k
. We continue to have a sizable backlog, 
and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to 
supply them. And we're thrilled to begin working with Verizon next month to 
offer iPhone 4 to its more than 93 million customers, as well as to
 
new 
customers who want iPhone 4 on Verizon.
 
Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its momentum and customer 
interest. We sold 7.3 million iPads, a sequential increase of over 3 million, 
with distribution in 46 countries by the end of the Decemb
er quarter. We 
continue to see great enthusiasm for iPads from consumer, business and 
education customers. Employee demand for iPad in the corporate 
environment remains strong, and the response to the product continues to 
be significant.
 
Enterprise CIOs ar
e adding iPad to their approved device list at an amazing 
rate. Today, over 80% of the Fortune 100 are already deploying or piloting 
iPad, up from 65% in the September quarter. Some recent examples include 
JPMorgan Chase, Cardinal Health, Wells Fargo, Arch
er Daniels Midland, Sears 
Holdings and DuPont.
 
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the 
quarter was $4.61 billion. The sales value by iPads alone was over $4.4 
billion, which yields an ASP of about $600. We increased the supply
 
of iPads 
during the quarter and expanded both the number of countries and the 
number of channel partners carrying iPad.
 
Channel inventory increased by about 525,000 units from the beginning to 
the end of the quarter to support increased sales and channel 
expansion, 
and we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks. 
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached over 160 million 
cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the December quarter.
 
In November, we launched iOS 4.2, whic
h brings over 100 new features to 
iPad users including multitasking, folders, unified inbox, Game Center, 
AirPlay and AirPrint.
 
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful, with over 300,000 apps 
available and well over 9 billion downloads to date.
 
We continue to be very 
pleased with iAd, which combines the narrative quality of TV ads with the 
interactivity of digital to provide a new kind of advertising experience. 
During the quarter, we expanded iAds beyond the U.S. to Europe and Japan 
and provide
d iAd Producer to marketers.
 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had a record
-
breaking 
quarter. Retail revenue almost doubled year
-
over
-
year to $3.85 billion 
compared to $1.97 billion in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 95%. iPad 
sal
es in our stores were very strong in the first holiday quarter. The stores 
also delivered a record Mac quarter, selling 851,000 Macs compared to 
689,000 Macs in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 24%. And about half 
the Macs sold in our stores during the
 
December quarter were to customers 
who had never owned a Mac before. International Retail Store sales were 
particularly strong with our average international store volume exceeding 
our very productive average U.S. store volume.
 
Additionally, our four stor
es in China were, on average, our highest traffic 
and our highest revenue stores in the world. We opened six stores during 
the December quarter, bringing us to a total of 323 stores worldwide at the 
quarter end, with 87 of them outside the United States.
 
W
ith an average of 321 stores opened during the December quarter, 
average revenue per store was $12 million compared to $7.1 million in the 
year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 69%.
 
Retail segment margin exceeded $1 billion for the first time and more than 
doub
led from $481 million in the year
-
ago quarter. We hosted a record 75.7 
million visitors in our stores during the quarter, compared to 50.9 million 
visitors in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 49%.
 
Total company gross margin was 38.5%, which was about 2
50 basis points 
higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better 
commodity cost than we had planned. The remainder of the difference was 
due to the leverage on the higher revenue and lower other product costs, 
including freight, warra
nty and phone support.
 
Operating expenses were $2.47 billion and included $247 million in stock
-
based compensation expense. OI&E was $136 million, ahead of our guidance 
primarily due to the positive impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
from net ass
et. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, below our guidance 
of 25.5% due to the one
-
time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D 
tax credit from January 1, 2010. We expect our tax rate for the remaining 
quarters of fiscal '11 to be about 25.5%.
 
Turning to cash. Our cash, plus short
-
term and long
-
term marketable 
securities, totaled $59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, 
compared to $51 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of 
$8.7 billion. Cash flow from operations wa
s $9.8 billion, an increase of 69% 
year
-
over
-
year.
 
During the September and December quarters, we executed long
-
term 
supply agreements with three vendors through which we expect to spend a 
total of approximately $3.9 billion in inventory component prepayme
nts and 
capital expenditures over a two
-
year period. We made approximately $650 
million in payments under these agreements in the December quarter, and 
anticipate making $1.05 billion in payments in the March quarter.
 
As we move ahead into the March quarte
r, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $22 billion, 
compared to $13.5 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect g
ross 
margins to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $50 million related to 
stock
-
based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.35 
billion, including about $250 million related to stock
-
based compensation. 
We expect OI&E to be about $50 mil
lion, and we expect the tax rate to be 
about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $4.90.
 
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record
-
breaking results and 
customer response to our products. We look forward to expanding the reach 
of the iPhone in the
 
United States with the addition of Verizon, and we 
remain very confident in our strategy and our new product pipeline. And with 
that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Peter. Also joining us for Q&A are Apple COO, Tim Cook; a

and one follow
-
up. Operator, may we have the first question please?

I have a question for you with regard to availability of iPhones, especially 
with the Verizon launch. I think you mentioned that there was a backlog that 
you weren't able to meet in the December quart
er. So I don't know if, Tim 
and Peter, if you could talk a little bit about what you're doing to ensure that 
you have sufficient quantities of iPhones and any changes you've made to 
ensure more component availability?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Shannon, it's Tim. As I m
entioned on the last quarter's call, we made a very 
bold bet, taking iPhone capacity for the September quarter with the new 
iPhone 4 in the lineup to 14 million. And as you may remember, we sold 
over 14 million in that quarter in total iPhones, so it was a
 
fantastic quarter. 
And that was up from a previous number that with the 8
-
ish million range. 
We were able to step that up in this past quarter to over 16 million, as Peter 
said in his opening remarks. And so we were able to increase over 2 million. 
And we

as with all good things, it takes some time to do that. Relative to Verizon, 
we are thrilled to offer the iPhone 4 to Verizon with 93 million customers, as 
well as any new customers who
 
want an iPhone 4 on Verizon. And we're 
going to do everything possible to get the iPhones into as many hands of 
those customers as possible.

And then I just had one follow up, with regard to the Mac App Store, which 
clearly 
just started, though I'm not sure how much you'll talk about it. But 
we've noticed your best
-
selling apps tend to be Apple software
-
based, Apple 
software apps. So how should we think about the Mac App Store? Any initial 
thoughts you have on it and initial 
things you've seen?
 
Timothy Cook
 
It's just getting going, but we are thrilled to have reported over 1 million in 
a very short amount of time. And so we're very happy with the start of it.
 
Operator
 
And next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Kat
hryn Huberty

Morgan Stanley
 
First question for Tim, how comfortable are you right now with the 
availability of iPhones and iPads? And if you still see shortages, how quickly 
do you think they can be addressed early this year?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Katy, let me ta
ke each one of those separately. On iPad, we increased 
dramatically last quarter. We sold 7.3 million the previous quarter, we were 
in the low 4s as you know. That did get us into supply
-
demand balance and 
also allowed us to expand to 46 countries, or to a
 
total of 46 by the end of 
the quarter, which added 20 during the quarter. And we're confident enough 
to add another 15 countries during the month of January that will take us 
over 60. And so we feel very, very good about the progress that we've made 
here.
 
Relative to iPhone 4, I also feel very, very good about what we've 
been able to do. However, it's not enough. We do still have a significant 
backlog. We are working around
-
the
-
clock to build more. I feel great that 
the demand is so high, but at this point
, I'm not going to predict when 
supply and demand will meet. We believe the reaction and results from the 
Verizon customers will be huge, and so I don't want to give a prediction right 
now when the supply and demand will cross.
 
Kathryn Huberty

Morgan Sta
nley
 
And then Tim, one of the most impressive metrics is the sequential on your 
growth of Asia
-
Pacific. Can you just talk about what's driving that and what 
plans you have in place, going forward, to sustain that growth?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Yes. That's a very goo
d question. First of all, let me say that of the BRIC 
countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China, we, several years ago, identified 
China as our top priority, and we put enormous energy into China. And the 
results of that has been absolutely staggering. To gi
ve you some numbers 
there and some specifics, we look at Greater China as a region. And Greater 
China, just for clarity, is mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The 
revenue from Greater China for Apple for last quarter was $2.6 billion, which 
was up 4x fr
om the prior year quarter. And to further, just an exclamation 
point by that, we did a little over $3 billion for the entire year, fiscal year 
2010. And so we're very, very proud of the team and the results that we've 
gotten there. Korea has also been a ve
ry, very good market for us. We had 
an outstanding Q1 there, primarily driven by iPhone and iPads. And there 
are several other Asian countries doing extremely well. Japan is not in the 
segment that you're looking out, but Japan by itself, the revenue was u
p 
83% year
-
over
-
year. And if you're familiar with the Japanese economy and 
the growth there, to grow 83% on the base that we're doing is stunning. 
And so we are placing more and more resource in these areas and continue 
to look for expansion possibilities 
throughout Asia.

Question for Tim in terms of the long
-
term business planning. There's been a 
lot of questions in terms of how far out you guys 
actually planned it. I was 
wondering if there's any insight you can give us in terms of what your long
-
term business plan is in terms of a product road map. Obviously, you can't 
share what that road map is. But how far will you guys go in Retail Stores 
and
 
so forth? Is it a one
-
year plan, is it a five
-
year plan, is it 
--
 
any sort of 
insight would be helpful?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Well, Gene, that's part of the magic of Apple. And I don't want to let 
anybody know our magic because I don't want anybody copying it. Wha
t I 
would tell you is that in my view, Apple is doing its best work ever, that we 
are all very happy with the product pipeline. And the team here has an 
unparalleled breadth and depth of talent and a culture of innovation that 
Steve has driven in the compa
ny, and excellence has become a habit. And 
so we feel very, very confident about the future of the company. I would 
also note to those people that haven't thought about it is we've done 
outstanding in our Mac business. We've had 19 quarters straight of gro
wing 
faster than the market, but we still have a relatively low share of a very 
large PC market despite having great momentum there. And so it would 
seem like there's enormous opportunity still there. We have a relatively low 
share in the handset market. T
he handset market is well over 1 billion units 
a year, and the smartphone market is growing faster than a weed. And so 
there's enormous opportunity here, and we have incredible momentum in 
that space. iPad just got started, it's a new category. We sold alm
ost 15 
million through the first three quarters, and we believe the market is huge. 
IDC, I saw this morning, is predicting it to quadruple in two years. I don't 
know what to predict in terms of specific numbers. However, we believe it's 
a huge market, as w
e've said before. And so we're in some great markets, 
some fast
-
moving markets, we have the best products we've ever done and 
an incredible product pipeline. We feel very, very confident.

And just a follow
-
up for P
eter, in terms of iPhones, you mentioned that if not 
for production constraints, you could've sold more. Is there any way to help 
us kind of back into how many more?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Gene, you can't run the experiment both ways, that's 
--
 
the demand for 
i
Phone has just been incredible. We could not make enough in the quarter, 
and we would've loved to have ended with more channel inventory than we 
did.

From Citigroup, we'll hear from Richard Gardner.
 
Richard Gardner

Citigroup Inc
 
I was just hopin
g that you could talk about what components were better 
than you thought in terms of price during the quarter? And then Tim, if you 
could give us your thoughts on the commodity environment going into the 
March quarter, given that flat panels are below cash
 
costs for some 
providers. What are you looking for going into the March quarter, please?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Rich, in terms of the go
-
forward in March quarter and what is embedded in 
the guidance that Peter gave earlier is that we expect a favorable pricing 
envi
ronment for DRAM, where supply exceeds the demand still. Some prices 
for raw materials such as key metals is currently increasing due to the 
anticipated strengthening of the worldwide economy, and it remains to be 
seen whether that continues. The bulk of t
he other commodities from NAND 
Flash to batteries to HDDs to ODDs to LCDs and most other commodities are 
generally in a supply
-
demand balance. And so we would expect this group of 
commodities to fall in prices consistent with their historical trends. In te
rms 
of what we saw last quarter, frankly speaking, in most areas, we saw a 
favorability and it was a key part of us overachieving our guidance gross 
margin.
 
Richard Gardner 
-
 
Citigroup Inc
 
And actually, Tim, if I could follow up, can you talk about which c
omponent 
areas you're making long
-
term commitments in on supply?
 
Timothy Cook
 
It's something I don't want to give out, Rich, because I view it as a 
competitive 
--
 
something I just don't want our competition knowing. But let 
me talk about it in general and 
hopefully, that will suffice. From our point of 
view on the design side, we design components where we believe we can 
innovate beyond what's available in the market. And the most recent 
example of this is the A4 chip. But with the A4 chip, we didn't feel l
ike we 
had to invest in the fab itself and build the fab because we felt like they were 
good options in the market for doing that, but not good options in terms of 
buying a design, and so we really focused on design. On the operational side 
of the house, a
s you probably remember, we've historically entered into 
certain agreements with different people to secure supply and other 
benefits. And the largest one in the recent past has been we signed a deal 
with several Flash suppliers back at the end of 2005 tha
t totaled over $1 
billion because we anticipated that Flash would become increasingly 
important across our entire product line and increasingly important to the 
industry. And so we wanted to secure supply for the company, and we think 
that, that was an abs
olutely fantastic use of Apple's cash. And we constantly 
look for more of these. And so in the past several quarters we've identified 
another area and come to some recent agreements that Peter talked about 
in his opening comments, in that these payments co
nsist of both 
prepayments and capital for process equipment and tooling. And similar to 
the Flash agreements, they're focused in an area we feel is very strategic. 
And so I'd prefer not to go into more detail about what specific area it's in, 
but it's the 
same kind of thinking that led us to those deals that led us to the 
Flash deal.

Guys, in the past, your build materials for key devices has generally come 
down at a rate that
 
allowed for fairly healthy gross margin expansion over 
time. And I'd say this has generally been true for iPod refreshes in the past, 
iPhone refreshes. Is there anything different about the iPad that we should 
consider going forward, that would make it di
fficult for margins to follow this 
historical pattern? And did you see some of this in the most recent quarter 
as well?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Bill, margins consist of a number different factors like which direction the 
commodity markets are going? Where the product
 
is within the product life 
cycle, as well as the value engineering that we do and the negotiating and 
so forth we do. And so I don't think that you can take a single product kind 
of out by itself and speak about it with any accuracy. And as you know, we 
d
on't guide at the product level on margin. We're confident with the 
guidance that Peter provided on gross margin in his opening comments.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
And I would ask of that, that we have always aggressively worked to lower 
our costs. I think we have
 
a good track record in this regard, and we shipped 
a lot of iPads in the December quarter, and have very strong gross margins. 
So I think we were quite happy with our progress.

On the iPad side again. Now that you've had the 
opportunity over the past 
few weeks to see more detail specs and in some cases, the price points for 
all the countless tablet devices coming into 2011. Can you comment on how 
you're currently dealing with competitive landscape for the iPad and how, if 
that
's changed, if at all, over the past few months?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Well, and if you're look at what's shipping today, there's not much out there 
as you know. And generally speaking, there's two kinds of groups today, 
that are at least on the market today. The o
nes that are using a Windows
-
based operating system are generally fairly big and heavy and expensive. 
They have very weak battery life, they require a keyboard or a stylus as an 
input device. And from our point of view and what we've seen, customers, 
frank
ly, just are not interested in them. Then you have the Android tablet, 
and the variety that are out shipping today, the operating system wasn't 
really designed for a tablet. And Google has said this, and so this is not just 
an Apple view by any means. And 
so you wind up having a size of a tablet 
that is less than what we believe is reasonable or even one that would 
provide what we feel is a real tablet experience. And so basically, you wind 
up with kind of a scaled
-
up smartphone, which is a bizarre product 
in our 
view. Then you've got kind of a third group 
--
 
and so those are the two that 
are shipping today. And frankly speaking, it's hard for me to understand if 
somebody does a side
-
by
-
side with an iPad, I think some enormous 
percentage of people are going 
to select an iPad there. Those are not tablets 
that we have any concern on. The next
-
generation Android tablets, which 
are primarily what you mentioned in terms of the CES, there's nothing 
shipping yet, and so I don't know. Generally, they lack performance
 
specs, 
they lack prices, they lack timing. And so today, they're vapor. We'll assess 
them as they come out. However, we're not sitting still. And we have a huge 
first
-
mover advantage. And we have an incredible user experience from 
iTunes to the App Store,
 
and an enormous number of apps and a huge 
ecosystem. And so we're very, very confident with entering into a fight with 
anyone.

From Sanford Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.
 
Toni Sacconaghi

Bernstein Research
 
You've said on previous e
arnings calls that the move to iPhone non
-
exclusivity in regions of the world has had no impact on your ASPs. Can you 
comment on whether that is it still the case today and whether we should 
expect any impact in the migration away from U.S. exclusivity? An
d related 
to that, there are several large carriers globally that the iPhone is still not 
offered in. Can you talk about some of the reasons why that isn't the case? 
Many of them are CDMA
-
based. And given that you now have a CDMA
-
based 
offering, is it unre
asonable to expect that we should see more CDMA carriers 
going forward?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Toni, it's Tim. Relative to the ASP, I generally would not do this. And I want 
to be specific, that this comment isn't related to the U.S. or any specific 
carrier or any s
pecific region. But to specifically answer your question, I 
don't envision the overall iPhone ASP decreasing from the December quarter 
that we just completed to the March quarter that we're currently in. And as 
you know, as our long
-
standing practice has b
een, we don't comment on 
after, after that period of time. Relative to other carriers, yes, we're always 
looking and assessing in every country who we should be doing business 
with and exploring different deals and arrangements, et cetera. And so we'll 
con
tinue to do that. What I've said before and we have seen this in every 
case, literally, that we've done, is where we've moved from a exclusive 
carrier arrangement to a dual
-
 
or multi
-
carrier arrangement, our growth has 
changed significantly and our market 
share has increased. And so that 
doesn't mean that would happen in every country nor does it mean that 
we're just out doing that in every country. We look at each one individual 
because each market has its own individual characteristics and parameters 
and 
technology. On the CDMA phone, specifically, I don't have any specific 
thing to announce today other than we're truly thrilled to be working with 
the Verizon team. They have built quite a company and earned a great deal 
of respect from the customers, and s
ome of them have waited a long time to 
get iPhone. And we're very, very happy to give them iPhone, and any other 
customers that are non
-
Verizon customers who wish to buy an iPhone. We're 
also very happy that we've signed a multi
-
year non
-
inclusive deal wit
h AT&T. 
And so we're very happy that we'll have shortly a dual
-
carrier setup in the 
United States.
 
Toni Sacconaghi

Bernstein Research
 
Tim, if I could follow
-
up on that, given your previous comments on China 
and the importance of that country strategicall
y for you and the investments 
that you're making in stores, et cetera, can you may be use that as a case 
study for why you're only in one carrier there? I think you've said that there 
are no longer any exclusive conditions that you have in place globally w
ith 
any carriers. So can you talk about other either impediments or hindrances 
beyond technology, of which CDMA is one, that may be limiting your ability 
to sign important carrier agreements in potentially very important and 
strategic areas for the company
?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Toni, I generally found people really want to do business with us, and their 
customers are very much desiring to have the iPhone. And so I don't really 
see a lack of desire. I don't want to comment about any specific country 
because I view a
ny conversations that we have going confidential in nature. 
It is true, as you said, that we are not under a contractual exclusivity now in 
any country in the world. The last one was the United States. We have 
moved away from those. I can guarantee you tha
t we always are looking at 
opportunities to grow. Of course, in the very short
-
term, I would also remind 
you that we're constrained on iPhone 4, and we're working around the clock 
to get as many of these out to our existing partners as we can.

Can you maybe give us your updated thoughts on the Mac side and maybe 
specifically address the impact of iPads? With the tremendous iPad unit this 
quarter, the cannibalization question 
is going to come up. And I just want to 
get your latest thoughts on that, if we could?
 
Timothy Cook
 
That's a good question. What we saw in the Mac this quarter was we grew 
23% at the worldwide level, and that is compared to a market growth of 
only 3%. And 
so we grew almost 8x the market rate of growth, which is, I 
think, stunning. And every region outgrew the market, so it wasn't just one 
region. Asia
-
Pacific led the growth with a whopping 67% year
-
over
-
year 
increase, and that's almost 10x what market did t
here, to put it in context. 
Japan grew at 56%, which is about 6x the market, and Europe and the 
United States both grew in double
-
digits despite both markets contracting 
overall. And so we did significantly better than the market in every major 
region, and
 
we're very proud of that. Now was there any cannibalization by 
iPad? Honestly, I don't know for sure. But yes, I think there is some 
cannibalization. But I also think there's a halo effect. As we've seen on the 
Mac by the iPod some years ago, I think ther
e is a halo effect from Apple 
product to Apple product. And of course, we have introduced millions of 
people in Asia to Apple through the iPhone. And we're now introducing many 
more through the iPad, and I think some of those decide to buy a Mac. And 
so wh
en you look at the Mac growth in Asia at 67%, and you look at the 
Japan growth at 56%, and you look at the U.S. and Europe growing in 
double
-
digits against shrinking markets, if this is cannibalization, it feels 
pretty good. The other point I would make is
 
that if the iPad or tablets do 
cannibalize the PC market, keep in mind that we have low share of the PC 
market. And so the other guys lose a lot more, and we have a lot more to 
win because of that. And so honestly, cannibalization is not something that 
we
 
are spending one minute on here. The iPad team are building the best 
iPad for the future, and the Mac teams are building the best Mac, and I can 
tell you that both groups believe that they can continue to grow and do 
great stuff, and I believe that.

Wedge Partners
 
And that's a great way to look at it. One of the things that's interesting to 
me is I see this trend of your bringing a lot more of the functionality from 
the tablet side, you're bringing it on to the Mac side. It was talked about 
e
arlier, the Mac App Store that's now on Mac OS X. And then as we're 
getting kind of teaser shots of Lion, it looks like the next OS is also taking 
even more kind of design and UI elements from the iPad side. So maybe if 
you could just talk about that a lit
tle bit, are these two platforms really 
merging into one? And is this the future of computing as you see it? Or is it 
just 
--
 
are you just kind of grabbing one or two aspects of tablets and 
bringing it into the OS X?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I think one of the 
--
 
part
 
of the magic of Apple is that there's not high walls 
between these product groups. They like each other, talk to each other, 
they're of the same DNA, they want to build the best products in the world. 
And so if one has a great idea, there's not a ""not inv
ented here"" in the other 
group. And so one of the key learnings from the iPad was that people love 
instant on, they really love that. And so the MacBook Air incorporated that, 
and that's just one simple example. But there are tons of examples 
throughout al
l of our products, where something started on one and went to 
a different one. And it's not always in the same direction either. It could 
start on the phone, and then flow forward, it could start on the iPad and 
flow, and so on and so forth. And so just th
e part of the way we run the 
company. And I think Steve said it great when he said, ""If the Mac company 
were a separate company, and the iPad company were a separate company, 
what would the Mac company build to compete with the iPad? And I think 
the answer
 
is the MacBook Air."" And I think that's a phenomenal insight, and 
I think a great way to look at it. And it's not that the groups are competing, 
they are sharing and coming up with these incredible products that people 
really want.

Tim, do you have data that you've gathered on the Phone and/or the iPad on 
new to the brand. You typically talk about Macs in the stores, you're getting 
50% new to the brand. 
Do you have any data related to the newness of the 
brand? I would assume it's substantially higher to that, but I want to hear a 
little bit about that. And depending on that outcome, if you talk a little bit 
about how you think these products, in particula
r, the Pad in emerging 
markets may help to continue drive share opportunities for you?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I don't want to share 
--
 
do we collect it? Yes, of course, we do. The numbers 
for iPhone are 
--
 
there's many such numbers, they're now big because 
we've 
been shipping iPhones for a while. Any product that you ship for a while 
looks a little different at the prime end or in the early adopter cycle versus 
when you get to the mainstream. The iPad went through that cycle quickly, 
and moved to mainstream 
and enterprise and all the rest in record time. But 
nevertheless, that data needs to settle some, even before internally, we put 
a lot of weight in it. But the bulk of your question doesn't need specific 
numbers. To make a point, if you look at our Asia
-
Pa
cific business, the 
revenue growth was 175% or so. And so this is incredible. And the size of 
business in Asia that we've now built is massive. To do $2.6 billion in China 
in three months, where just two years ago, we did less than $1 billion in the 
whole 
year, it is phenomenal, or actually for the year before. And so I think 
we are 
--
 
it's clear that we're introducing a lot of people to Apple who 
previously had not been introduced to the company, and I think that helps 
across the product line.

In the U.S., I'm just trying to understand how you see the tablet market 
more broadly having greater penetration rates, say in established markets 
versus emerging markets. But typically, the notion is that tablets in many 
cases
 
are more about consumption versus creation. And just want to hear 
your thoughts, not on growth rate, but on absolute unit opportunities 
between the established markets and the emerging markets?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I think that the tablet market is, the 
opportunity is so large, it's large

A question for Peter, I just wanted to cash out the revenue outlook. Your 
sequenti
al decline of, I guess, 17% is a little more than last year's, but you 
have Verizon now for the iPhone. So what components, I guess, other than 
iPod, are expected to have to contribute to the big decline, if intuitively, 
maybe iPhone has some support from 
Verizon?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Ben, I'll answer your question in a couple of ways. First of all, we're working 
hard to increase supply of iPhones. Tim has talked about that, but that will 
come over a period of time and not necessarily, overnight, as we said. I
n 
terms of the sequential guidance this year, let me start by saying we are 
thrilled to be giving you guidance for 63% revenue growth year
-
over
-
year, 
which will translate to a 50% earnings growth. So the business is performing 
extremely well. We're shippin
g the best products in Apple history and 
customer response has been tremendous. But as I said in my prepared 
remarks, we increased the iPhone and the iPad channel inventory by about 
775,000 units, and this will have a bit of impact on the sequential compar
e 
that you referred to. In terms of the products, for Mac, we've just reported 
the highest Mac sales ever, and we've outgrown the market for 19 
consecutive quarters. We would expect to see a sequential unit decline, 
which is typical for us after the holida
y season. For iPod, we would also 
expect to see a large sequential decline, which is also typical for us after the 
holiday season. For iPhone, we'd expect to see a significant year
-
over
-
year 
increase. And for iPad, this will be our first experience, going 
from the 
December to March quarter, so we'll see. However, it was clear to us that 
the iPad was a hot holiday gift item, which fueled the 75% sequential growth 
that we saw in the December quarter. And given this, we would expect a 
sequential decline in the
 
March quarter. So that's what's gone into our 
thinking, Ben.

And then just a follow up for Tim, the last call, maybe, or one of the last 
calls, Steve had a lot of comments around Android and perhaps, some of its 
disadva
ntages versus your platform. Is there any other observations you'd 
like to make now that, we had a few more months, to see the market 
develop further and with Verizon, and even more tablet sales on the horizon, 
feedback you're getting from developers, or a
nything else you'd like to add 
on the battle with Android, kind of updating Steve's recent comments from 
last quarter?
 
Timothy Cook
 
Well, if you look at the iPhone portion, we had record sales on iPhone with 
16.2 million units sold in the quarter. And Pete
r said we believe we could've 
sold more if we had more supply. From the market estimates that we've 
seen, it suggests that we grew faster than the market. Obviously, we're 
working around the clock on increasing supply. We're continuing to expand 
countries 
and carriers. And I've talked a little bit of that with Toni's question. 
We're getting enormous enterprise traction, with 88% of the Fortune 100, 
which is mind
-
blowing, I believe. 83% of the Fortune 500, 60% of the FT 
100. So the enterprise traction is gai
ning. We have the highest customer sat 
[satisfaction] ratings in the industry versus Android or RIM or any 
--
 
we 
have the largest App Store with over 300,000 apps. We have now sold over 
160 million iOS devices. And I mean, this is huge. And we fundamentall
y 
believe that our integrated approach delivers a far superior customer 
experience than the fragmented approach. And you can see this in a variety 
of ways from the fragmentation of the number of App Stores out there that 
people are going to pull their hair
 
out, because they're going to have a 
variety of updating methodologies, and a variety of payment methods, and 
slightly different derivatives. You can see from surveys, people are doing to 
see who is on the latest OS, and you'll notice that the iOS is alwa
ys off the 
charts on the percentage of people that have the latest version versus the 
other guys. We are launching with Verizon next month. We believe there's a 
huge pent
-
up demand there, and we think that, that will help us in the U.S. 
And so I think I'd 
probably just repeat it, much of what he said before. But 
the net
-
net is we think that our integrated approach is much better for the 
end user because it takes out all the complexity for the end user instead of 
making the end user a systems integrator them
selves. I don't know about 
you, but I don't know very many people that want to be system integrators 
as a consumer or somebody in the enterprise. And so I think that the more 
iPhones that we can get out there into people's hands, the more people love 
them.
 
And I think we've got a very bright future. I think the same thing 
about iPad. It's the same set of issues at the end of the day. The differences 
on iPad, of course, is that we have a 
--
 
we've been running three quarters 
without any significant competitio
n of any type. And I think that the 
customer sat ratings on the iPad are also off the charts. So I don't know if 
any of that is new, I doubt that it is. But I think we're in a very good 
position.

Peter, I want to see if you can give us a little more insight on the iPad gross 
margins going forward. Just given Tim's comments earlier about the bounty 
of underachievers out there, at least, nearly going, should we assume the
n 
that Apple can really improve the future set with the next generation and 
kind of hold pricing stable?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
I'm sorry, Mark, that's not a question I can answer. We don't talk about 
future products. But I can tell you that in terms of what we
're shipping 
today, we're always aggressively working to lower our costs. And I think we 
have a good track record in doing so, and our gross margins were stronger 
than we thought for the December quarter. And I've provided guidance for 
the March quarter at
 
38.5%. And we feel very, very good about the 
performance of our products and our cost of products.

And then my follow

up, Tim, I apologize if this question has been asked, I 
fell off for a moment, I want to come back 
to the MacBook Air. Just given 
the initial success here and momentum, can you give us any sort of insight 
in terms of how you're looking at that platform now? Is it kind of a premium 
tablet? Is this kind of more of a notebook still? I trying to get a sense
 
of just 
kind of a one
-
two punch in terms of the iPad, with the MacBook Air, kind of 
giving you a kind of a double coverage, if you will, in both notebooks and 
tablets?
 
Timothy Cook
 
The way that we look at it is it's the Mac of the future shipping today, a
nd it 
was a phenomenal part of our growth on the Mac last quarter. It has gotten 
off to a unbelievable start. The customers love it. They love the precision of 
it, they love the thinness, the weight, the instant on and the list is long, I 
think. And so we'
re really happy with how it's doing out of the starting 
blocks. And as you know, we've only been shipping it for less than 90 days, 
and so we've just gotten going.

There's been a lot of talk about this consumerization of enterprise 
technology, and obviously, it's being driven by folks bringing their iPhones 
and iPads to work. I know you said it's some big share gains within your 
statistics. But I was 
curious if you think there still are some barriers around 
maybe developer training at the corporate level or security or things that 
just sort of naturally need to get worked through before you start to see 
those penetration numbers even increase further o
r start to see a wider 
swathe of employees use iPhones and iPads in business?
 
Timothy Cook
 
I think that the consumerization that you speak of, of the enterprise, is one 
of the megatrends that are occurring. I think the most forward
-
looking CIOs 
are coming 
to the realization that the productivity of the person, the 
creativity of the employees is materially more important than everyone 
using the same thing. And the ability to write apps in a simple and 
straightforward manner for the iPhone or the iPad through
 
the SDK is an 
incredible thing. And you can wind up, literally, running your whole business 
off of an iPad or an iPhone. And so I think the list of ideas and places that 
people can go there are 
--
 
were unimaginable just a few months ago. And so 
I see an e
normous potential there. The numbers are already incredible. And 
think about this, the iPad started shipping in April, and we're already up to 
80% of the largest companies deploying or piloting the product. This is 
unheard of, at least, in my dealings with
 
the enterprise over the years. 
Generally, enterprise is much slower and much more cautious and uses 
things that have been in the market for a long time. And I think to 
everyone's credit, they've seen the value of this from a productivity and 
creativity po
int of view, and they're really moving fast. And so I think we're 
just scratching the surface right now. In terms of inhibitors, the iPad has a 
huge advantage because as you probably remember, as we went to various 
different iOS releases, we always put in 
a huge chunk of enterprise features. 
And so this isn't something that we just started focusing on. We started 
focusing on this before we shipped the first phone. And with the synergy 
that exists with the iOS between the different products, other products g
et 
the advantage of it, not just the product that it ships on initially. And so I 
think there's a huge play here for us.

We are in a unique position of having world class hardware, software and 
service skills under one road, which enables us to provide an unparallel user 
experience to 100s of millions of customers. And working with our vibrant 
developer community, 

 
We are winning with our products in all the ways that are most important to

From the colorful iPhone 5c and forward thinking iPhone 5s to the powerful 
new iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro to the stunning iPad Mini with 
Retina 
display and the dramatically thinner, lighter and more powerful iPad Air.
 
Thanks to a deep collaboration between our design and engineering teams. 
We also launched iOS 7 with a stunning new redesign, powerful new features 
and a great new service cal

most companies would be proud to just have one of them.
 

ny accomplishments during 
fiscal 2013. Our customers had an incredible response to our product line 
up, buying a 150 million iPhone, 71 million iPads and 16 million Macs across 
the fiscal year.
 
We expanded the breadth and depth of our ecosystem and we gene
rated 
over $16 billion revenue from iTunes software and services. We also 
welcomed almost 400 million visitors to our retail stores and opened or 
remodeled 49 new stores and for the second year in a row we produced over 
$50 million in revenue per store.
 
We
 
generated record total company revenue of $171 billion, earnings of $37 
billion and operating cash flow of $54 billion. We paid over $8 billion in 
capital expenditures to both to our supply chain, expand our infrastructure 
and increased our retail footpri

We more than doubled the size of our capital return program to a $100 
billion, including the largest share repurchase authorization in history 
and we 
become one of the largest dividend payers in the world.
 
In fact, we returned over $36 billion to shareholders to dividend and share 
repurchases in the last five quarters alone. We remain firmly committed to 
our objective of delivering attractive ret
urns to shareholders through both 
our business performance and a return of capital. We review our capital 
program regularly and our orders engaged in the discussion of capital 
allocation on an ongoing basis.
 
We have solicited feedback on our capital return

September quarter revenue ever.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $37.5 billion
, up $1.5 billion or 4% from the 
year
-
ago quarter, and slightly above the high end of the guidance range. 
Gross margin was 37% at the high end of our guidance range, and operating 
margin was $10 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was 
$7.5 b
illion translating to diluted earnings per share of $8.26.
 
As for the details of the quarter, I would like to begin with iPhone. We sold 
33.8 million iPhones compared to 26.9 million in the year
-
ago quarter, an 
increase of 6.9 million or 26% and a new 
September quarter record. iPhone 
sales were ahead of our expectations and grew stronger year
-
over
-
year in 
each of our geographic segments.
 
We were particularly pleased with growth in a number of developing markets 
with unit sales up sharply year
-
over
-
year 
in Latin America, the Middle East, 
Russia and India. We were also very happy to add NTT Docomo to our 
carrier line up in Japan, a country where demand to iPhone has been 
especially strong.
 
iPhone sales remain very robust in the U.S with comScore estimating
 
that 
Apple was the leading smartphone manufacture with a 40.7% smartphone 
subscribership for the three months ending in August. And among North 
American customers polled by ChangeWave late last month, we plan to 
purchase the smartphone with a 90 days, 63%
 
indicated they plan to 
purchase an iPhone.
 
We exited the quarter with about 14.3 million total iPhones in channel 
inventory, which represented a sequential increase of 3.3 million from the 
June quarter and placed us at the low end of our target range of 4
 
to 6 
weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis.
 
Customers are loving their iPhones. Based on the most recently published 
research, ChangeWave measured a 96% customer satisfaction rate among 
iPhone users and Kantar measured a 92% customer l
oyalty rate, 
significantly higher than the competition. And we believe that a great 
customer experience translates to much higher usage. In fact, Experian 
reported that iPhone users spend an average of 53% more time each day on 
their phone than android pho
ne users.
 
iPhone continues to be a key productivity tool for organizations around the 
world aided by apps from the app store as well as those custom built for 
internal use. In fact, nearly 35,000 companies representing millions of 
employees worldwide are b
uilding custom apps that address specific 
workflow improvements with their iPhones and iPad users.
 
In the U.S., over 14,000 employees of Johnson Controls are using iPhones 
for work. The company has created in
-
house apps that have enhanced field 
technician 
service delivery and customer communications. In China, AVIC 
International, a unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China has equipped 
27,000 employees with iPhones to access internally developed apps for 
office, administrative documentation, approval p
rocesses in key business 
intelligent systems.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold 14.1 million iPads during the quarter compared to 
14 million in the year
-
ago quarter. iPad sales exceeded our expectations in 
the September quarter as we approach our new product introd
uctions. We 
experienced robust year
-
over
-
year sales growth in Japan, Russia, the Middle 
East and we were pleased with strong back
-
to
-
school demand for iPad in the 
U.S. and Canada. iPad sell
-
through was roughly equal to sell
-
in, so we exited 
the quarter wit
h about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory within our 
target range of four to six weeks on a look
-
back basis.
 
Interest in iPad remains incredibly strong. In an August survey by 
ChangeWave, consumers who intend to purchase tablets within 90 days, 
5
5% indicated they find the purchase of iPads more than four times the rate 
of the next most popular alternative. And of those who already own iPads, 
the survey measured a 99% customer satisfaction rate. The momentum of 
iOS devices in enterprise also remain
s incredibly strong.
 
In its latest Mobility Index Report, Good Technology indicated that the iOS 
platform accounted for 95% of enterprise mobile app activations and 72% of 
all mobile device activations in the September quarter while iPad accounted 
for 90% 
of total tablet activations. Companies around the world are using 
iPads with custom apps to reinvent their legacy business processes; 
improving efficiencies across organizations and job sections.
 
For example, direct store delivery reps at Dr Pepper Snapple
 
Group uses 
iPads to facilitate communications and streamline the product delivery 
process. East Japan Railway personnel use iPad Minis to stay informed about 
schedule changes and access conductor manual. And Swedish manufacturer 
SKS uses a custom iPad app
 
to calculate the life of their ball bearing 
products saving 10 to 15 minutes per calculation for every engineer several 
times per day.
 
Schools around the world continue to adopt iPad to transform teaching and 
learning in the classroom. In the U.K. the num
ber of iPads sold to K
-
12 
schools has more than doubled year
-
over
-
year and in Latin America; over 
70,000 iPads are being used by systemic learner students [ph] across 800 
schools to improve their learning experience.
 
Here in the U.S., school districts cont
inue to rollout large iPad initiatives to 
students. The Coachella Valley School District in California is currently 
distributing over 19,000 iPads to its entire student body. In South Carolina 
every one of the Horry County School District's 10,000 middle s
chool 
students will receive an iPad this year. These broad deployments are in part 
driven by the great educational content available on iPad and we're pleased 
to report that iBooks textbooks are now available across the U.S., U.K. and 
Australian national h
igh school curricula.
 
Last week we were thrilled to introduce new iPads featuring the A7 chip with 
64
-
bit desktop
-
class architecture, ultrafast wireless and expanded LTE 
connectivity. The new iPad Air features a beautiful retina display in an 
elegant unit 
body design that is 20% thinner and 28% lighter than the 
fourth generation iPad and the iPad Mini with retina display packs all the 
pixels of the iPad Air into its stunning 7.9 inch display and runs over 475,000 
iPad apps available in the app store.
 
Turnin
g to Mac, sales with 4.6 million Macs were above our expectations, 
which is a 7% decline from the year
-
ago quarter. IDC estimates that the 
global personal computer market contracted by 10% during the September 
quarter indicating that Macs continues to gain
 
share just as they have with 
29 of the last 30 quarters. We were especially pleased with strong year
-
over
-
year growth in sales of MacBook Air which we updated in June. In late 
September we updated iMac with fourth generation Intel quad
-
core 
processors, ne
w graphics, next generation Wi
-
Fi and faster PCIe flash 
storage options.
 
Last week we launched new versions of MacBook Pro with retina display 
featuring fourth generation Intel core processors, faster graphics, long rate 
battery life and a more affordable 
price. Also last week we launched 
Mavericks, the 10th major release of OS X with more than 200 new features. 
Mavericks brings iBooks and Maps to the Mac, includes the new version 
Safari, enhances multi
-
display support, introduces Finder Tabs and Tags and 
d
elivers core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and 
performance and is now free. We ended the quarter with Mac channel 
inventory that was just below our four to five week target range.
 
We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes so
ftware and 
services in the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Our iTunes Stores 
generated record billings of $4.4 billion in the September quarter thanks to 
continued strong growth in sales of apps. The quarter's iTunes billings 
translated quarterly iTunes r
evenue $2.4 billion, up 15% from the year
-
ago 
quarter. The strong iTunes sales combined with other software and service 
revenue resulted in total quarterly revenue 4.3 billion from iTunes software 
and services, an increase of 22% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Cumulative
 
app downloads have reached 60 billion and our app developers 
have now earned 13 billion from sales to the App Store, half of which they've 
earned in the last year. We had a tremendously successful launch of iOS 7 
last month with hundreds of millions of do
wnloads in the first few days 
alone, making it the fastest software upgrade ever. Last week we reported 
nearly two
-
thirds of iOS devices were already running iOS 7; that's 
significantly higher than the percentage of users running the latest versions 
of oth
er mobile operating systems. This rapid transition to the latest version 
of iOS not only means that more customers are having the most advanced 
experience possible but it also enables developers to offer their latest app 
innovations to hundreds of billions
 
of users in a single software release.
 
iOS offers something now for everyone with its great new design and 
features such as control center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio. In fact the 
number of unique listeners who have tried iTunes Radio is now 20 million 
and 
growing. iOS 7 also includes significant features that make iPhones and 
iPads more secure in users to manage in corporate environments, offering 
new ways to configure and deploy devices at scale.
 
New device management capabilities include control sharing o
f documents 
and attachments, App Store license management, wireless managed app 
setup and streamline mobile device management and enrollment. In terms 
of security, iOS 7 offers enterprise single sign
-
on, default third party app 
data protection and per app 
VPNs automatically connect stored corporate 
apps to the network without the need for users to change complicated 
settings.
 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The revenue for the quarter 
was 4.5 billion, up 6% from the year
-
ago quarter. The st
ores produced very 
strong iPhone sales with unit growth of 36% per store per week compared to 
the September quarter last year. W completed the remodels of two stores 
and opened eight new stores during the quarter ending with a total of 416 
stores including
 
162 outside the United States. We are projecting a total of 
approximately 30 new store openings in fiscal year '14, about two
-
thirds of 
which will be outside U.S.
 
We also plan to remodel about 20 stores over the course of fiscal year '14. 
With an average 
of 411 stores opened in the September quarter, average 
revenue per store was 10.9 million compared to 11.2 million in the year
-
ago 
quarter. Retail segment income was 709 million. We hosted 99 million 
visitors to stores during the quarter which translates t
o 18,500 visitors per 
store per week. Operating expenses were 3.8 billion and included 467 million 
in stock
-
based compensation expense. OI&E was 113 million and the tax 
rate for the quarter was 25.9%.
 
Turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with 146.8 bi
llion in cash plus 
short term and long term marketable securities, a sequential increase of 
$100 million from the June quarter. Our domestic cash was 35.5 billion at 
the end of the September quarter, a sequential decline of 5.2 billion largely 
attributable
 
to our share repurchase activity. $111.3 billion or 76% of our 
total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter, and cash flow 
from operations was $9.9 billion.
 
We paid $2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter and we executed an 
additional $5 b
illion in repurchases up 10.4 million shares of Apple stock 
during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of $36 billion in 
payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last five quarters of 
which share buybacks were $23 billion. This h
as resulted in cumulative 
retirement of almost 47 million shares and represents 5% of the total shares 
outstanding prior to the launch of our repurchase program. More than 44 
million of these shares have been retired in the past two quarters alone.
 
Finally
 
given that our capital return program must be funded from domestic 
cash, and as a result of our payments to date, the cash that we can net 
domestically and return to shareholders to stop accumulating. In fact we 
give return to shareholders who invested es
sentially all of the increase in 
available net cash generated since the beginning of our capital return 
program in 2012. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 
for common share payable on November 14, 2013 to shareholders of record 
as in t
he close of this on November 11, 2013.
 
Now, as we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review 
our outlook which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that 
Nancy referred to in the beginning of the call. First, I was to explain 
a bit 
about revenue deferrals. We believe that our software and services play a 
tremendous role in delivering an overall experience that our customers have 
come to know and love. Over the last few years we have added significantly 
to the offering that we p
rovide our customers a no incremental charge from 
operating system upgrade rights to non
-
software services such as Siri and 
iCloud.
 
So, iLife and iWork has become as essential for the user experience as mail, 

to, iMovie, Pages, 
Numbers and Keynotes available as free downloads to customers who 

upgrades as well as iLife and iWork free to our Mac customers. As a result of 
the traditional righ
ts and features we are deferring a greater portion of the 
sale of each iOS device in Mac sold. We anticipate that the additional 
deferral per device sold coupled with our sequentially greater unit volume 
expectations in the December quarter will result in 
about a $900 million 
sequential increase in the net amount of revenue deferred for software 
upgrade rights and non
-
software services.
 
In total we expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $58 billion 
compared to $54.5 billion in the year ago quarter. We
 
expect gross margins 
to be between 36.5% and 37.5% reflecting approximately a $105 million 
related to stock
-
based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be 
between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion including about $585 million related to 
stock
-
based compensa
tion expense. We expect OI&E to be about $200 
million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.25%.
 
In closing, we are very pleased with the results of the final quarter of our 

products 
including our amazing new iPhones and iPads. We remain committed to 
delivering great innovative products and services that delight our customers 

pipelines.
 

 
open the call to questions.

given all the new products that we have launched in the last few weeks. 
During the quarter we expect gross margin to benefit from the leverage on 
the substantial sequential increase in revenue. Offsetting these benefits we 
see a few factors including the higher deferred revenue relating to the 
software that I talked about in m
y prepared remarks. And as I said we 
expect the sequential increase in our deferral which is not only revenue but 

with higher cost structures and lower pricing. Third, FX headwin
ds primarily 
from the Yen and fourth, the new lower priced MacBook Pro and iMac which 
have higher cost structures and credit structures. So those are four things 
that I would point out Katy.

Okay, very helpful. Tim, 
the press and even some of your competitors are 
quite complementary of the innovation in iPhone 5s. But it seems like 
investors are looking or glancing over the 64
-
bit ARM processor, the 

 
not 
exactly sure what those technologies enable, i.e. why do you need a 64
-
bit 
ARM processor in a phone. So, just hoping you could enlighten us a little bit 
on that question.
 
Tim Cook
 
Well, I think everything that you mentioned Katy is the front end of a 
long 
road map and so we have the first 64
-
bit smarphone as you mentioned and 

know that it's pretty profound to 
--
 
use it from a security point of view and 
use it also to pur
chase apps or music or movies et cetera. And so, both of 
these I think are the most important person here obviously is what our 
customers think and these new innovations on the 5s and the 5c combined 
led us to have our best iPhone launch ever with selling 
about nine million 
units through the weekend. So it was

Okay, great, thanks. L
ooking at the iPhone business as well, for the 5c there 
was some anticipation that the price point would be lower and there was 
obviously some debate around that when you launched it. Now that you had 
the device out there for a while, a few weeks; what typ
e of response are you 
seeing from the most cost sensitive regions and can you remind us of some 
of the things you are doing to make the products increasingly affordable for 
the emerging regions in particular?

tier offer and then of course the iPhone 5s. And our goal is to overall 
have growth worth for total iPhone, but also within that we w

each of those categories grow as compared to the

because the most important thing for us is to make a great product, but we 

 
I realize that some 
people were reading rumors about that the entry phone would be the 5c, but 
that was never our intent obviously. Our entry iPhone is the iPhone 4s and 

iPhone 4 in v

regions at somewhat lower price points we saw a fair amount of price 

4s.

Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. And then rel

overall, last quarter you reminded us that the iPhone ASP and mix tends to 
be at its highest levels in the first few months of a product cycle and then 
tends to trend downward throughout the product cycle. 
Do you think we 
should assume similar patterns hold for this cycle or there is some unique 
factors we should consider particularly given the change in the product line?
 
Tim Cook
 
All things being equal what we would normally see on our products is that 
you 
have a large number of people that are early adopter related that come 
into the market right after we announced and buy our very best product. So 
other things being equal that's what we would expect to see.

Antonio Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein
 
Yes. Thank you. Tim, you commented in your initial remark
s about new 
product categories. I think this was also something you were explicit about 
in your April quarterly conference call where you said that consumers and 
investors should expect new products, including new product categories in 
the second half of t
his year and first half of 2014. So can you reiterate that 
we should have that expectation? And when you talk about new product 
categories, I presume that since you made the statement in April, there 
have been none? I just want to make sure I understand th
e semantics of 
what you referred to as a new category?
 
Tim Cook
 
Tony, I didn't say in April that you would see them in this year and the first 
half of next year just to be clear on that. But what I have said is 

 
I have 
said that you would see some excitin
g new products from us in the fall of 
this year and across 2014. And I obviously stand by that and you've seen a 
lot of things over the last couple of months. In terms of new product 
categories, specifically if you look at the skills that Apple has from ha
rdware, 
software and services and at incredible app ecosystems, these set of things 
are very, very unique. I think no one has a set of skills like us and we 
obviously believe that we can use our skills in building other great products 
that are in categorie
s that represent areas where we do not participate 
today. So we're pretty confident about that.
 
Antonio Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein
 
Okay. As a follow
-
up I wanted to revisit the question your pricing strategy. 
Last quarter you spoke very buoyantly abo
ut elasticity that you experienced 
on the iPhone 4 and you had lowered the price in many emerging markets to 
about $400. Yet when the new products came out, the 4s was actually at a 
notably higher price than the 4 had been the previous quarter. The 5c was 
obviously in line with what we had seen before with the 4s and 5s was in line 
with the 5. So if anything one of the common themes that came out on last 
earnings call was the desire to embrace the elasticity of the iPhone, but as 
best I can tell price point
s across the board seem to be a little bit higher 
than they were three months ago despite the significant success you had 
there. So I'm wondering how we should think about what lessons you 
learned from the 4 pricing changes, why you didn't choose to keep t
he 4 
given that it was an extraordinary strong seller as best we could tell last 
quarter and how you proceed 

 
how you expect to try and continue to 
address the lower priced segments of the smartphone market?
 
Tim Cook
 
Tony, the 400 number just to clarify y
our number not mine, what we did 
with our lineup this time was the 4s is replacing the 4 and so if you look at 
the U.S. as an example, the 4s is now 3, the 4 previously was 3. When you 
translate that out of the U.S., it depends on the market as to what 
spe
cifically is happening. As you know currency changes and the strength of 
the dollar doesn't play in our favor in some geos from that perspective. But 
generally we see the 4s as our entry iPhone offer that gives somebody the 
ability to access the entire eco
system with a fantastic product. And we 
clearly understand that there is elasticity in that market and we'll move 
accordingly.
 
Nancy Paxton

Hi. Thanks a lot. First question is on China. Tim, congrats on being I think 
the only company in my sector that grew in China this quarter. I'd have to 
check that but got to be one of them. You returned to growth I believe at 
6%, if m
y math is right. What happened and do you see that growth rate 
accelerating? We're hoping you have new partnerships there and how can 
you expand distribution?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes. Ben we had a pretty good quarter in China. We obviously want to do 
better. But if y
ou look at the quarter, we did grow by 6%. Underneath that, 
iPhone units were up 25% year
-
over
-
year despite significant constraints on 
iPhone 5s that affected the whole company [ph]. However, we were able to 
launch in our first round this time in China and
 
that was a big change in the 
result of a close work relationship with the carriers in China and the 
government. And so we feel really good about that. We are able to do that 
on the iPad as well as we announced last week. For the full year, the Greater 
Chi
na region generated over $27 billion in sales for us, up 14% year
-
over
-
year. So we have a reasonable sized business there. In the year
-
ago 
quarter, iPad launched. It launched late in China and so that pressure, the 
6% down some otherwise it would have been
 
I think even a stronger quarter 
given the strength of iPhone. So we are continuing to invest in stores. We 
opened one additional store in Greater China in the last few weeks. We're 
investing in indirect distribution. Our point
-
of
-
sales are up by about 50%
 
year
-
over
-
year on the iPhone and we're continuing to go out to more cities. 
Initially we were very focused on just the large cities and so we're working 
on both coverage on launching earlier and execution and continuing to build 
on our retail practice the

Barclays Capital
 
Okay. And I guess nothing to announce more but my second question is for 
Peter. There's some confusion around the revenue deferral and I was just 
hoping you could clarify it for gross margins. The $900 million is about 

 
I 
don't know I guess 160 basis points if I have that right on gross margins. 
How much of that should we say is pressuring gross margin down in your 
guidance? I mean do we take about 

 
would your gross margin guidance had 
been about half the difference ther
e higher if it weren't for this revenue 
deferral? And then when do we recoup that margin? How many quarters 
does it take to recoup and how will that flow back to the model? Thanks.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure, Ben. We have been defying revenues for the sale of 
each iOS device 
and Mac given that we have been providing updates to software. Given the 
announcements that we made last week and that I went through it in my 
prepared remarks, we have actually increased those deferrals. iPhone and 
iPad, we are differing b
etween $15 and $25. That's up as much as $5 per 
device and Mac has been some $20 to $40, so up an additional $20. On a 
sequential basis, given the increased deferral rates that we have as a result 
of increase in the software that we are providing to custom
ers for free 
coupled with our sequential unit increases, we will defer we think about 
$900 million more in revenue in the December quarter than we deferred in 
the September quarter. So you can calculate the impact to gross margin on 
that. We will also and 
that goes straight through the margin, its revenue and 
a dollar
-
for
-
dollar reduction in gross margin. We will then record that 

ratably and for Max over a four year period of time.
 
So, Ben just to 
summarize, we happen to frame revenue on both iOS devices and Max for a 
number of years given the software that we have been giving away for free. 
We have increased those rates beginning in September for the iOS devices 
and in October for 
the Max, and it will come back into those products over 
two and four years as I said.

Hey, good afternoon and just to make sure this is crystal clear here on the 
gross margin. It would have been about 
38.5% would have been the mid

Okay, great. And then beyond the December quarter in terms of structural 
elements around the iPhone gross margin, a couple of years ago with the 4s 
we saw the launch and then we saw the margins ramp kind
 
of nicely after 

but are there some structural things that have changed the profitability of 
the iPhone it would be good to know as we think about our models in 2014.
 
Peter Oppenhei
mer
 



talked about in answering Kat

given the very big sequential increase in revenue. Leverage cut both ways, 
so presumably that would go against us in the March quarter. However we 
would expect to defer less for the software deferrals in the March
 
quarter as 

very hard to get down cost curves as we have in the past, no change.
 
Gene Munster

Okay. And then my follow

up question, in terms of the iPad and the Min

fluctuations in the growth rate. How do you think about that segment in 
terms of growing at or above or below market growth rates around tablets? 
And separately is there any diffe
rences in terms of how often people are 

them every three years versus a little bit over every two years for the 
iPhone, is that accurate. So, the size of the opportunity and then m
aybe just 
any sort of nuances and the upgrade behaviors between the iPhone and the 
iPad.
 
Tim Cook
 
Gene, its Tim. We continue to view the tablet market as huge. We see it as a 

ma

other things that are very important to us. We do believe that this has been

ow year

over

year, and if you look 
back we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago. We get off to a great 

shipping the new Mini. We do feel that we wanted to reduce the price of 
the 

incredible value to get access to the whole of the ecosystem and so forth.

ever done. And so, I thi

offer the Mac OS for free and provide iWork and 
iLife with new device 
purchases? How are you thinking about it vis

vis some of the competition?
 
Tim Cook
 
Our primary reason for doing it Shannon was that we wanted it to become a 
part of what it meant to own a Mac and what it meant to own an iOS 
device. 
We saw iWork had become the best selling productivity app on a mobile 
device. We wanted all of our customers to have access to our very latest 
software, so they would have access to our best features. And so we decided 
to make the bold move of maki
ng it free and I know some other folks charge 
a $199 or so for each of these actually for the OS and the productivity apps. 
But we really wanted to make it a part of the experience and so we are 
making it free and we are going back all the way to Snow Leop
ard on the OS

eral 
supply comments and also comments on component cost.
 
Tim Cook
 

very significant backlog. We are still 
--
 
we still have a significant backlog. 
However, our supply is building ea

and 

more countries with the iPhone 5s and 5c as of last Friday and we'll roll out 
another 16 this week. And so we're right on where we would like
 
to be in 
terms of achieving 100 countries by the end of the calendar year. In terms 
of the retina or the iPad Mini with the retina display, we'll start shipping later 
in November. It's unclear whether we will have enough for the quarter or 
not. We now hav
e mini 

 
we will have but you really don't know the demand 
until after you start shipping and so we'll see how that goes. But I think we'll 
do fairly well with iPad as I had mentioned before. We felt like it's going to 
be a really great holiday season. On 
terms of component cost, both DRAM 
and NAND were up last quarter from the previous quarter. DRAM we believe 
will continue to be up in this quarter. We think NAND will be flat and other 
commodities will fall sequentially.

O
kay. And then Peter, about a year ago you indicated that the December 
quarter would benefit by about 200 basis points in gross margin due to a 
combination of mix shift toward phones and higher volume. Is that the sort 
of uplift you would expect from those 
factories this December quarter?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Steve, I don't want to put a precise amount on it but we 

 
I see us 
benefiting from a couple of things in the quarter; the leverage on the higher 
revenue by far being the biggest. As Tim mentioned, we expe
ct to have a 
positive commodity environment and selling iPhones is never a bad thing 
from the margin perspective.

We'll go to Mark Mosko

Mark Moskowitz

JPMorgan
 
Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. The first question for Tim just regarding the 
channel inventory levels of 14.3 million for the iPhone, much higher than 
we've seen in the quarters past. Is there similar sort of mes
sage there in 
terms of you not having much broader coverage in terms of incremental 
coverage or is there a much bigger incremental upgrade cycle from your 
installed base or both?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think the way 

 
the number one thing to know on the channel inventory is 
that our range as you know for iPhone is four to six weeks and we were at 
the low end of our range. And so that to me is the most 

 
that's the most 
important thing I look at anyway 
I should say. You can choose to look at the 
thing that's most important to you. In terms of a changing from where it's 
been in the past, the things that you should consider are the 

 
China was in 
wave one this year, so there was a lot more point
-
of
-
sales t
here. We added 
DOCOMO in Japan. And so that's a large carrier to add. And what probably 
were not in the opening comments was that of the 14 million, 1.8 million of 
those were iPhones that were in transit and therefore not available to sale in 
the channel. 
And we always count those in channel inventory because they 
are in our sales line. And so that's how I look at the iPhone inventory.
 
Mark Moskowitz 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. And then just a follow
-
up, if I could. A year ago you had a very 
ambitious multi
-
product ra
mp in terms of new products coming out. At the 
same time you did have some impacts related to supply constraints. Just to 
kind of follow up on Steve's question. Do you feel that four months later, 
fast forward to the future now that you're in a much better
 
shape to kind of 
avert or navigate some of these big supply constraints that inflicted some 
problems on you last year or can we see a similar situation as we move to 
the quarter?
 
Tim Cook
 
As I mentioned on the iPhone 5s I feel like we're doing really well
 
on supply. 
The demand is very robust. And so we are in backlog right now. But I feel 
confident about us continuing to ramp and do quite well for the quarter. On 
the iPad Mini we'll start shipping later this month and it's very difficult to 
forecast exactl
y when supply and demand will balance there. We'll also see 
about the iPad Air as we go out this week. I think we'll have a really good 
weekend. It may be that not everyone can find what they want more [ph]. I 
think versus last year I think one key differe
nce is we announced one of our 
key Macs, the iMac but we didn't begin shipping until the end of December. 
And so we went for more than two months with minimal iMac sales and 
therefore from a Mac point of view year
-
over
-
year last year, we had 

 
our 
only dow
n a quarter, down versus the market that is in the last 30 quarters. 
And so I don't envision that happening this year. I feel really good about the 
way the MacBook Pros have gotten off last week. They've gotten off to a 
huge start. I feel great about Mac g
rowing year
-
over
-
year this quarter. I feel 
great about iPad growing year
-
over
-
year this quarter as well. You can tell 
that from the strong guidance numbers that Peter gave earlier.

Chris Whitmore

Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about iPhone ASPs. They were down 
about 7% year
-
on
-
year in the quarter and down sequentially. Last year they 
were up sequentially on the launc
h. Was that a product supply availability 
issue? And how do you think about ASPs going forward?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Chris, it's Peter. Sequentially we were relatively flat, so I'll comment on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis. They were down 7% as you indicated and thi
s was 
primarily due to a significant increase in the sales of our entry SKUs where 
we had made them more affordable to attract more first
-
time smart buyers. 
We've also encouraged some FX headwinds from the yen, the Australian 
dollar and a number of the eme
rging markets which impacted us as well. I 
don't want to forecast ASPs for the December quarter. We'll report to you in 
January what they were. But the FX headwinds will likely continue given 
where exchange rates are today.
 
Chris Whitmore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
A
nd just to follow
-
up on Mark's earlier question around channel inventories, 
that 14 million unit number was I think higher than a lot of people expected. 
Was that also SKU
-
ed [ph] towards the low end of the product stack given 
the 5s was short exiting the 
quarter?
 
Tim Cook
 
The 5s was in huge backlog and so any kind of 5s that was in the channel 
was a transitionary kind of move 

 
maybe perhaps in transit and so forth. 
We did have as I mentioned before, we had 1.8 million units of total iPhone 
units in transi
t at the end of the quarter. So that's a pretty substantial 
number.
 
Chris Whitmore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
And just lastly I wanted to ask about subsidies. That wasn't mentioned as a 
potential impact to phone margins but can you comment on carrier subsidies 
more g
enerally? How sustainable are they given the competitive 
environment and how are carriers responding to the pricing stack of your 
phone line? Thanks a lot.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
I think carriers like to sell as many units as they can and get as many people 
in 
their service. And in most regions walk into the un
-
serviced contracts and 
so they're very predictable and reliable and I don't really see that changing. 
I think the carriers have come up with some different or some carriers have 
come up with different sal
es programs that might appeal to someone who 
wants to upgrade their phone annually instead of every other year. I think 
those programs in general probably reduce the subsidy somewhat in the 
aggregate for people that take these up. But customers may due to 
such a 
fair exchange for getting the upgrade more often, so there's a customer 
proposition for it. Other than that I think we have great relationships with 
the carriers. I think they were as we were very happy with the iPhone 
rollout.

Thanks, Nancy. Good after
noon, everyone. This is our first earnings call 
since the passing of Steve Jobs. The world has lost a visionary, a creative 
genius and an amazing human being. Steve was a great leader and mentor 
and inspired everyone at Apple to do extraordinary things. Hi
s spirit will 
forever be the foundation of Apple, and we are dedicated to continuing the 
amazing work that he loved so much.
 
Only Apple brings together software, hardware and services into such a 
powerful and integrated experience for our customers. As we 
move forward, 
we will continue doing that with relentless focus. I'd like to take this 
opportunity to express our gratitude for all of the condolences and 
expressions of support that we have received following Steve's passing.
 
With that, I'd like to turn o
ver the call to Peter to discuss our Q4 results. 
Peter?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Thank you, Tim. We are very pleased to report record September quarter 
revenues and earnings. We set a new all
-
time quarterly record for Mac and 
iPad sales, and we established a new 
September quarter record for iPhone 
sales. We're very proud of these results and with the momentum of our 
business.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $28.3 billion, representing year
-
over
-
year 
growth of 39%. The year
-
over
-
year increase was fueled primarily by st
rong 
growth in iPad, Mac and iPhone sales. Operating margin was $8.7 billion, 
representing 30.8% of revenue. Net income was $6.6 billion, increasing 54% 
year
-
over
-
year and translating to earnings per share of $7.05.
 
Turning to the details of the quarter. I
'd like to begin with our Mac products 
and services. We established a new all
-
time quarterly record with sales of 
4.89 million Macs, exceeding the previous record set in the last December 
quarter by 760,000 Macs, representing a 26% increase over the year
-
a
go 
quarter's results. That is more than 6x IDC's most recently published 
forecast of 4% growth for the PC market overall in the September quarter. 
Mac sales increased strongly in each of our operating segments led by Asia
-
Pacific with growth of 61% year
-
ov
er
-
year.
 
The increase in Mac sales was fueled by the very strong growth in MacBook 
Air as well as the continued strong performance of MacBook Pro. In July, we 
updated the MacBook Air with the next
-
generation processors, high
-
speed 
Thunderbolt I/O technolog
y and a backlit keyboard. And while the portables 
represented 74% of the total Mac mix, we also generated record desktop 
sales in the quarter primarily due to continued strength of iMac.
 
We launched Mac OS X Lion on July 20 and customer response has been 
t
remendous with over 6 million Lion downloads during the September 
quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of 
Mac channel inventory.
 
Moving to our music products. We sold 6.6 million iPods compared to almost 
9.1 million in the yea
r
-
ago quarter. Though down year
-
over
-
year, total iPod 
sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continue to account for 
over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players 
remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly d
ata published by MPD, 
and iPod continues to be the top
-
selling MP3 player in most countries we 
track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter 
within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.
 
The iTunes Store generat
ed record results with revenue in the quarter of 
almost $1.5 billion. The iTunes catalog continues to grow, and customers 
have downloaded over 16 billion songs and 650 million TV shows to date. 
We've also been very pleased with the growing popularity of th
e iBookstore 
with over 180 million downloads of iBooks to date.
 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 17.1 million 
iPhones compared to 14.1 million in the previous September quarter. This 
represents 21% year
-
over
-
year growth and a ne
w September quarter 
record. We experienced particularly strong iPhone sales growth in our Asia
-
Pacific segment where iPhone sales more than doubled year
-
over
-
year.
 
We were pleased with the iPhone sales growth as we prepared for the 
transition to the iPhone
 
4S. We expected iPhone sell
-
through to decline 
sequentially from the June quarter as a result of new product rumors 
following the announcement at our Developers Conference in June that iOS 5 
and iCloud would become available in the fall. As we predicted, 
iPhone sell
-
through did decline across the quarter especially in the second half as new 
product speculation intensified.
 
We ended the quarter with about 5.75 million iPhones in channel inventory, 
a sequential decline of about 180,000, which places within o
ur target range 
of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from 
iPhone handset and accessory sales was $11 billion during the quarter 
compared to $8.8 billion in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 24%.
 
Given the October launch of the
 
iPhone 4S, we opted to defer new carrier 
and country additions from this September quarter until after the launch. As 
we indicated 2 weeks ago, we were very pleased to have recently added 
Sprint and KDDI to our carrier line up. These additions bring us to
 
230 
carriers in 105 countries. For the sixth consecutive time, iPhone ranked 
highest in consumer reports, wireless consumer smartphone customer 
satisfaction survey, achieving the highest ratings for overall satisfaction as 
well as for performance, ease of
 
operations, features and design.
 
iPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enterprise with 
93% of the Fortune 500 deploying or testing the device, up from 91% last 
quarter and 60% of the Global 500 testing or deploying iPhone, up from 
57% 
last quarter. A recent example of iPhone's enterprise success is Lowe's. 
Lowe's is in the process of rolling out over 40,000 iPhones with a custom 
application to allow their store associates to execute realtime inventory 
checks, product orders and interact
ive customers with how
-
to videos.
 
Additional examples of companies around the world supporting iPhone on 
their corporate networks include L'Oreal, Royal Bank of Scotland, SAP, Texas 
Instruments, Jacobs Engineering Group, Tenet Healthcare, Jaguar Land 
Rover
, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Lincoln National and CSX Corporation. And 
of course, we're thrilled to begin shipping iPhone 4S this month.
 
We are extremely enthusiastic about Siri, the iPhone 4 intelligent assistant 
that helps you get things done by just asking
, and we think customers will 
love the performance of the iPhone 4S' dual
-
core A5 chip, all
-
new camera 
and full 1080p HD video recording. Now shipping in 7 countries, we are 
working hard to get iPhone 4S in customers' hands as quickly as possible. 
We look 
forward to rolling it out in 22 more countries by the end of this 
month.
 
Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We 
set a new record with sales of 11.1 million iPads during the September 
quarter compared to 4.2 million in 
the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 
166%. We've said from the beginning that the tablet market is a huge 
opportunity for Apple, and we are very excited with our current performance 
and the tremendous customer enthusiasm for iPad.
 
We launched iPad 2 in add
itional 20 countries, ending the September quarter 
with distribution in a total of 90 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of 
iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter were $6.9 billion compared to 
$2.8 billion in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase o
f 146%.
 
We ended the quarter with about 2.5 million iPads in channel inventory, a 
sequential increase of about $1.45 million, which places within the target 
range of 4 to 6 weeks. It's been just 18 months since we introduced iPad 
and the pace at which busi
nesses worldwide are adopting this technology is 
unprecedented. Today, 92% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPad 
within their enterprises, up from 86% last year. Internationally, 52% of the 
Global 500 are testing or deploying iPad, up from 47% l
ast quarter.
 
Every day, we learn about innovative new ways our enterprise customers 
are using iPad. The airline industry is a great example of the momentum 
we're seeing. United Continental Holdings is putting iPads in every cockpit to 
replace heavy, 
paper
-
based flight bags. In Japan, All Nippon Airways is now 
using iPad in training programs for flight attendants.
 
Sonic Automotive is using iPad for customer check
-
in at the service 
department and also to provide analytics to regional managers. Aflac, Bi
ogen 
and General Mills have developed internal apps that their field sales teams 
leverage daily, and technicians of Siemens Energy are bringing iPads along 
when they do maintenance work at the top of their wind turbines.
 
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod tou
ch, we surpassed the 0.25 billion 
cumulative iOS device sales in the September quarter. We were very pleased 
to begin delivering iOS 5 last week and customers are loving its many new 
features, including Notification Center, iMessage, Newsstand and Reminder
s.
 
We're also very excited to launch iCloud last week, with breakthrough 
services including iTunes in the Cloud, Photo Stream and Documents in the 
Cloud. We believe iCloud is the easiest way for customers to manage their 
content going far beyond anything e
lse available today and early reviews 
have been excellent.
 
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 500,000 apps 
available and over 18 billion downloads to date. We expanded the App Store 
to 33 additional countries during the September
 
quarter, ending with a total 
of 123 countries.
 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue was $3.6 billion, an 
increase of 1% over the prior
-
year quarter. The stores experienced very 
strong year
-
over
-
year growth in Mac and iPad sales, which 
was largely offset 
by decline in iPhone sales given the tough comparisons in the year
-
ago 
quarter when iPhone 4 was launched and compounded by speculation about 
a new iPhone this year. The stores generated record
-
breaking Mac results, 
with sales reaching 1
.1 million compared to 874,000 in the year
-
ago quarter, 
an increase of 25%. And about half of the Macs sold in our stores during the 
September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.
 
We opened 30 new stores in the quarter, 21 of which w
ere outside United 
States. On the last weekend of the quarter, we opened 7 stores in 6 
countries, including our first store in Hong Kong. With our highest opening 
day for Mac sales ever, our Hong Kong store joins our 5 other China stores 
as the highest tra
ffic and among our highest revenue stores in the world. We 
ended the quarter with a total of 357 stores. With an average of 336 stores 
opened, average revenue per store was $10.7 million compared to $11.8 
million in the year
-
ago quarter.
 
Retail segment mar
gin was $679 million compared to $917 million in the 
year
-
ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted a 
record 77.5 million visitors in the September quarter. As we look ahead to 
fiscal 2012, we will continue to focus on international
 
expansion. In total, we 
expect to open about 40 stores with approximately 3/4 of them outside 
United States. We will also be expanding or replacing higher volume stores 
primarily in the U.S. that are simply too constrained to deliver our desired 
customer 
experience.
 
Total company gross margin was 40.3%, which was 230 basis points higher 
than our guidance. This difference was almost entirely due to lower 
component and other product costs. Operating expenses were $2.67 billion 
and included $253 million of st
ock
-
based compensation expense. OI&E was 
$81 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%.
 
Turning to cash. Our cash and short
-
term and long
-
term marketable 
securities totaled $81.6 billion at the end of the September quarter, 
compared to $76.2 billion 
at the end of the June quarter, a sequential 
increase of $5.4 billion. This increase was net of cash paid for the acquisition 
of Nortel patents and the Nokia settlement during the September quarter. 
Cash flow from operations was $10.4 billion, an increase 
of 84% year
-
over
-
year.
 
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. I'd also like to remind you that approximately 
o
nce every 6 years, we add a week to the December quarter to align our 
fiscal periods with the December calendar. So this December quarter will 
span 14 weeks rather than 13 and will end on December 31.
 
We expect revenues to be about $37 billion compared to 
$26.7 billion in the 
December quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 40%, 
reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock
-
based compensation 
expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.25 billion, including about $350 
million related to sto
ck
-
based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about 
$85 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 24.25%. We are 
targeting EPS of about $9.30.
 
In closing, we're extremely pleased with the strong conclusion to our record
-
breaking fiscal 2011. Over the c
ourse of the year, we generated revenue of 
over $108 billion, an increase of $43 billion or 66% over our fiscal 2010 
results. We blew past historical records by selling over 72 million iPhones, 32 
million iPads and almost 17 million Macs in fiscal 2011.
 
We
 
expanded our reach by opening 40 new retail stores, adding scores of 
new carrier and leaseholder relationships and broadened our online presence 
through Apple stores and App Stores around the world. And last but not the 
least, we generated almost $26 bill
ion in net income during the year, an 
increase of 85% year
-
over
-
year, which was even faster than our revenue 
growth. We're thrilled to begin selling iPhone 4S and to bring iOS 5 and 
iCloud to our customers this month, and we remain very enthusiastic about 
our new product pipeline.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Bill Shope.

I have a few iPhone questions if I could. Given that the 4S was launched so 
close to the holiday selling season, can you give us an idea of your 
con
fidence in the production ramp and the distribution ramp and how you've 
mitigated the risk of a shortage during peak consumer demand?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Bill, it's Tim. We've gotten off to a great start with the 4S. We've sold over 4 
million in just 3 days af
ter launch, and so we're thrilled with the start that 
we have. We're confident that we will have a large supply, but I don't want 
to predict when supply and demand might balance because the demand is 
obviously extremely high right now. But I'm confident th
at we will set an all
-
time record for iPhone this quarter.
 
Bill C. Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Now and just a question on the September quarter iPhone dynamic. So it 
sounds like the primary negative impact on shipments was purely fr
om a 
sell
-
through pause. You didn't have any real channel inventory drawdown 
issues affect shipments. Is that correct?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Not entirely. If you look at on the sell
-
through basis, the sequential 
comparison is down 2.4 million units. That's 19.7 
million from the previous 
quarter, which had an inventory build in it to bring it to a sell
-
in of over 20 
million and to 17.3 million this quarter, which had an inventory reduction of 
a little less than 200,000, which Peter talked about in his opening rema
rks. 
That 2.4 million was much less of a reduction than what we were expecting 
and was a large factor in our revenue exceeding our guidance by over $3 
billion. We expected it to be greater than 2.4 million because we knew that 
there was great anticipation 
of the June or July new iPhone because that was 
the pace that we have been on for the last several years. And as we had 
predicted, that sell
-
through decline did occur in the quarter, but not nearly 
to the extent that we fought and therefore, we significant
ly beat our 
guidance. The reduction happened largely in the back half of the quarter as 
the speculation hit extreme highs. However, we're thrilled to be shipping the 
new iPhone 4S and iOS 5 and iCloud, and we're very confident that we will 
set an all
-
time 
record in the December quarter for iPhone sales. We 
--
 
in our 
wildest dreams, we couldn't have gotten off to a start as great as we have 
on the 4S.

From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from Katy Huberty.
 
Katy Huberty

Morgan Stanley, Research

Peter, this quarter you were able to print north of a 40% gross margin 
despite the mix shift away from your high
-
margin product and towards lower 
margin products. So just curious why you don't think you can do better than 
40% in December given how
 
well the iPhone 4S is already doing and the 
favorable component cost environment, and then I have a follow
-
up for Tim.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. I understand your question, Katy. We expect the gross margin to be 
relatively flat on a sequential basis. And we
 
expect this because as you 
pointed out, we do think a favorable component cost environment will 
continue, and we certainly expect a very strong mix of iPhones, both of 
which are positive for gross margins. However, we expect both of these to 
be basically 
fully offset by the impact of higher cost structures and reduced 
price points for the recently introduced iPhones and iPods as well as the 
stronger U.S. dollar. It's really strengthened in the last couple of weeks from 
where we were across the summer. So t
hat's why.
 
Katy Huberty

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Okay. And then Tim, over the course of the last year, you've provided great 
insight into Apple's traction in China. So I wonder if you could update us on 
how you're tracking in that region, but al
so provide some insight into how 
substantial China could be to Apple over time. For instance, is there any 
reason that China couldn't be as big as the U.S. market once you open more 
stores and optimize the product set there?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes, thanks for
 
the question. Should the China progress has been amazing, 
if you look at our Greater China revenue, it represented just 2% of Apple in 
our fiscal year '09. And in the fiscal year we just ended, it accounted for 
12%, and if you just look at the quarter tha
t we just ended, it accounted for 
16%. So it's our fastest growing major region by far. It delivered $4.5 billion 
of our revenue for the current quarter, and that's up almost 4x or about 
270% year
-
over
-
year. That brought the total revenue for the fiscal ye
ar to 
over $13 billion. And to further put that in context, a year ago in fiscal year 
'10, we were just right above $3 billion. So it is growing at a feverish pace. 
We have placed new retail stores there as you know. We now have 6 in 
Greater China. Our onl
ine store opened at the end of last year, and so we 
have still 
--
 
we haven't hit our one
-
year anniversary there yet. We have over 
200 Mono
-
branded stores that we call APRs, which are resellers on there. 
That's a very premium shopping experience, and we are
 
now up to over 
7,000 point of sales on the iPhone in Greater China. And so we're continuing 
to make investments in this. How far can it go? Certainly in my lifetime, I've 
never seen a country with as many people rising into the middle class that 
aspire to
 
buy products that Apple makes. And so I think it's an area of 
enormous opportunity, and it has quickly become #2 on our list of top 
revenue countries very, very quickly and we're obviously placing additional 
investment. We're building more stores there as
 
well as doing quite a few 
other things to continue to deliver our great products to the people of China. 
We're also placing additional focus on some other areas that have shown 
great promise over this fiscal year such as Brazil. Brazil was up 118% year
-
ov
er
-
year and went over the $900 million mark. Russia is also beginning to 
look more and more promising. As I've mentioned on the last call, the Middle 
East we believe has significant opportunities. So there's several of these 
markets that historically Apple
 
has not been strong and that the iPhone has 
really opened up and introduced Apple to a whole set of customers that 
didn't get excited about looking at other products that we have. And I think 
certainly, the iPad will be doing the same. And so I think Chin
a, the sky is 
the limit there, and I wouldn't discount some of these other places that I've 
mentioned as well.

We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Two questions. First for Tim. If yo
u weigh in a little more on Apple's historic 
strength in terms of manufacturing and supply chain strategies, I know we 
talked about this before, Tim. But can you give us an update in terms of 
your margin flexibility as you start to use more than one source
 
for certain 
parts of your supply chain manufacturing chain? And I have a question for 
Peter after that.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes. Mark, I think we have an outstanding team in this area and a track 
record that's unparalleled in the industry. Although we keep tr
ying to 
improve it all the time, we've also used our balance sheet in a favorable way 
here to do some strategic deals on different parts that we felt were very, 
very important to Apple across a series of products. As we get larger, there 
are some areas whe
re we've elected to diversify some. However, our 
approach has been and I think will always be to do business with as few 
people as we can so we can be very deep with them and do great innovative 
stuff together, and you can't tend to do that when you go out
 
to many, 
many different people. And I think they give us great quality and also 
reasonable prices, and so that winds up helping our margin.

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
And then the second question is around the iPad. Recentl
y, Amazon with the 
Kindle Fire is trying to make the tablet market more of a soapbox derby in 
terms of lower price points but maybe limited feature sets. Can you kind of 
weigh in on what your view is? Is this making more of a hybrid market 
where it's not r
eally a tablet but kind of a hybrid and Apple has not really 
seen any effects from a demand perspective at this point?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
We had an outstanding quarter last quarter with setting a record with doing 
over 11 million, and at the same time we were
 
setting a Mac record, which is 
I think very phenomenal in and of itself. But we've seen several competitors 
come to market to try to compete with the iPad over time. They've had 
--
 
some had different form factors, different price points. And I think it's 
reasonable to say that none of these have gained any traction thus far. And 
in fact, as all of those competitors were coming to market, our share actually 
went up such that in the June quarter IDC 
--
 
according to IDC, we were 
responsible for 3 out of every
 
4 tablets sold. And I think when you really 
assess this thing and look at iOS 5, iCloud, the ecosystem with iTunes and 
the App Store and books and movies and the fact that we have over 
140,000 native apps for iPad versus a number in the hundreds for the o
ther 
guys, I feel very, very confident about our ability to compete and extremely 
confident in our product pipeline.

And Peter, d
id I hear that right that you mentioned the deferral of iPhone for 
new carriers and new country additions? Wondering if you could elaborate a 
little bit on what that was and the potential impact on the numbers?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Gene, that's in my prepared
 
remarks. We opted to defer adding new carriers 
or countries during the September quarter knowing that we would launch 
the iPhone 4S very early in the October month, and we wanted to launch our 
new carriers with our latest products so we waited. I think th
at did have 
some impact on the September quarter. I think the biggest impact were the 
rumors that were just very pervasive, particularly in the second half of the 
quarter. There just seemed to be the rumor of the day. But that's behind us. 
We have just sta
rted selling the iPhone 4S and it's off to a fantastic start, 
and we're thrilled to be including Sprint and KDDI in our carrier lineup. And 
we're heading into this holiday season with the best product lineup Apple 
has ever shipped and tremendous momentum.

And Tim, I realized the Amazon Fire question is out of the way here, but do 
you have any just high
-
level thoughts on the size of the tablet market? I 
mean, it's not netbooks. It's computer
s. I mean, how do you think about, 
internally thinking about, how big this market could be in the next 2 years?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
We thought, Gene, from the beginning of this that it would be a huge 
market, and it has been even greater than we 
thought. And we've now sold 
40 million on a cumulative basis. And it's pretty clear to me that if you 
forecast out in time that the tablet market 
--
 
I still believe it will be larger 
than the PC market. That's not a guidance number. That's just something 
t
hat I very much believe. There will be many, many more people that can 
access it, and the ease of use is so phenomenal and off the charts that I 
think it's a huge opportunity for Apple across time.

I was actually wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the iPhone. 
Just do you have any idea of what 
--
 
how many units do you feel were 
pushed out and deferred into the next quarter?
 
And in general, what do you 
think 
--
 
how should we be thinking about the 4S launch given the pent
-
up 
demand from the quarter? And anything else with regard to the velocity and 
how it worked into your guidance of $37 billion?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Ben, I think t
he number 
--
 
you can't run the experiment twice. So we can't 
tell you with precision how many units we would have sold if there had not 
been rumors and people weren't expecting a new iPhone. But I certainly 
believe it was a substantial, and that's the reas
on that we called it out. And I 
think anybody monitoring the press would probably come to the same 
conclusion. You could go out and talk to a group of customers and probably 
get the same kind of answer. On the 4S, I think it's off the charts. If you do 
a c
omparison of the 3 days after launch of last year on iPhone 4, we came in 
at 1.7 million. This year, we were over 4 million in the same time frame, and 
so that's the mother of all uplifts. And so we're thrilled with how we've 
gotten started, and the feedba
ck that we're getting from customers is just 
fantastic. And so I couldn't be more pleased with where we are.

And just my follow

up is with regard to the iPad category, now that it's, I 
wouldn't call

generally in Macs, you're up a little sequentially lately in the fourth quarter. 
You have an extra week now. Any thoughts on how the iPad seasonality may 
be working in the iPad over the next qu
arter or 2, just in terms of more

Ben, it's Peter. I'll give you some thoughts on the December quarter but 
we're not going to provide our thoughts yet for the March quarter. We would
 
expect to establish new company records for both the iPhone and the iPad in 
the December quarter. These are fantastic products, and the momentum 
here is tremendous. And for Macs, we would expect to outgrow the market 
on a year

Shannon S. Cross
 
My first question. Tim, can you talk a little bit more on how you see Siri and 
how you see Siri in the future? I mean, is th
is a feature or do you see it 
more as a key way that consumers are going to interact with their devices? 
Just any color you could give would be great.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
The number of people using it already is amazing, and the questions and so 
forth and the 
personality that it has is also incredible. And so we see this as 
a profound innovation. And I think over time, many, many people will use it 
in a substantial way. And what percentage of their input will be by that, I 
don't know. And what percentage of the
ir searches, I don't know. But our 
guts have been since the beginning of this is that it is substantial and it's an 
incredible innovation, and that's the feedback that we're getting from 
customers.
 
Shannon S. Cross
 
Okay. Great. And then can you make a comm
ent just on the supply chain 
given the HDD issues in Thailand? What are your thoughts 
--
 
any clarity 
you've gotten from the people on the ground there?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
It's a very good question. Our hearts go out to all the people in Thailand who 
have expe
rienced these devastating losses of life and property as a result of 
the monsoons and the flooding. Like many others, we source many 
components from Thailand and have multiple factories that supply these 
components. There are several factories that are cur
rently not operable, and 
the recovery timeline for these factories is not known at this point. As you 
can appreciate, the weather really hasn't allowed an ability to assess those. 
From the work that we have done, we would say that our primary exposure 
is o
n the Mac because as you point out, of the number of drives or drive 
components that are sourced in or 
--
 
Thailand is a significant portion of the 
total of worldwide supply of drives. And so I can't give you a precise 
accounting. It is something that I'm c
oncerned about. We do expect 
--
 
I'm 
virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives as a 
result of the disaster. How it affects Apple? I'm not sure, but we placed our 
assessment to the degree that we can make one in the guidance
 
that Peter 
has already given you in the $37 billion number.

Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your ongoing patent disputes 
most n

litigation. Is it to get injunctions on violating products? Is it to capture 
royalty fees? Or what is it?
 
Timothy D. Co
ok
 
Toni, I don't want to comment on any particular litigation. It's our policy not 
to do that. But basically as you know, we spend a lot of time and money and 
resource in coming up with incredible innovations, and we don't like it when 
someone else takes t

Okay. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the price reductions on 
the 3GS offering. You've gone to free on postpaid and dramatically reduced 
the price $160 to $200 in most countries on the prepaid offering. Do you 
--
 
how are you thinking abo
ut this price reduction in terms of its potential 
elasticity? Do you see it as targeting a new segment of consumers? And how 
are you thinking about whether this will largely resonate with prepaid 
customers or with postpaid customers?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
We did
 
it because we wanted to make the iPhone more accessible to a 
broader market. And so not only did we take the 3GS to free on a postpaid 
basis and that's the U.S., but it's free on postpaid in many, many other 
markets as well. But we also lowered the price 
of the iPhone 4 to $99. And 
so we've done both of those because as we looked at it, these are still 
fantastic products, and we think that we can do reasonably well selling those 
in the postpaid markets. It also has the advantage of having a lower price in 
the prepaid markets. Obviously not free and $99, but lower than where 
those entry points were previously. And so we did it for both markets, Toni, 
both the postpay and the prepay markets. Both of those are very, very 
important to us, and it has been our th
inking for a while to do that.

Tim, as a follow
-
up to Shannon's question, I was hoping that you might be 
willing to give us a more general view of how y
ou view component supply 
demand and pricing going into the fourth quarter. And then also, particularly 
unibody casings given the issues that you've had with one of your suppliers 
in that area as well, do you expect that to have any significant impact on 
Ma
cBook Pro or MacBook Air supply in the fourth quarter?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
On the second question first, we treat every concern that we hear about our 
suppliers very, very seriously, and we're currently investigating and 
assessing the situation. And we 
factored our supply outlook as we currently 
see it into the numbers that Peter has given earlier. In terms of the general 
market for components, NAND and DRAM, which really declined last quarter 
and LCDs, we see all 3 of these generally in a very positive 
supply situation 
and therefore, we expect the pricing to continue at favorable levels. Most of 
the other components we expect to fall at or above historical trends. And so 
generally speaking, it's a very positive market from a supply point of view. 
Now tha
t is with the asterisk of the disaster that just happened in Thailand 
aside, and I'm not sure how that will play out. But I do believe that the risk 
there is more focused on the Mac portion of our product line.

Okay. And if I could ask a follow
-
up, I guess, for Peter and Tim. I know you 
don't give operating margin guidance or gross margin guidance. But it does 
seem like we could be moving it to a new phase for the company where 
potentially, several of the f
astest growing products in the product line, 
whether it be iPad or these lower priced iPhones that could see some good 
price elasticity at the low end, could be the fastest growing products for the 
company next year and could start to put some pressure on 
gross margins. 
I'm just wondering if you, a, agree with that assertion. And b, if that is the 
case, is it still reasonable to think that the company can maintain or expand 
operating margins next year if gross margins come under pressure due to 
product mix?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Rich, it's Peter. Let me make some comments about the December quarter, 
and then I'll give you more of our philosophy beyond. We're not providing 
future quarter or future year guidance. For the December quarter, we 
anticipate our gross m
argin being about 40% and having nice leverage on 
OpEx yielding an operating margin of just over 31%, which would be quite 
strong. As we look forward, we are going to continue to offer the very best 
products to customers that we can. We are going to be ext
remely 
innovative. We're very confident and excited about what's in the product 
pipeline. You'll see us be aggressive in the future. And where customers 
want to buy, that's fine with us. We just want them to buy our products. As I 
look back over the last c
ouple of years, I think we've done a very good job 
gaining market share and growing our top and bottom lines and running a 
great business, and we're just going to keep coming to work every day to do 
that in the future.

I've got just one clarification, one question. On the iPad side, could you just 
speak about where we are on the distribution rollout of that product, in 
particular, where we are on
 
countries and carriers and point of sales? And 
was there any pause around that in the September quarter? And then a 
question for Tim. Tim, you mentioned just the growth not only in China but 
also the potential that may exist in Brazil and Middle East and 
Russia, and I 
guess you could throw India in there as well. What do you practically need to 
do to actually realize the potential there? Is that a case of local 
manufacturing in some of those countries? Is it a case of carrier distribution? 
And how long mig
ht it take to realize that? Because I understand the focus 
now is on China, but I'm trying to understand what Apple needs to do to 
realize the potential of the emerging middle class in those countries as well.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes, we are in 90 countries on
 
iPad. We have about 40,000 points of sale 
around the world. To put that in some context, we have about 50,000 on 
iPod and about 120,000 on iPhone. So you can get a feel for the extent of 
the rollout there. There are still countries left to do, but we are 
in the main 
countries with iPad. Do I think there was a slowdown on iPad? Where the 
iPhone numbers, it's crystal clear in looking at the numbers that there was a 
slowdown. That is not the case on iPad. And so where I believe we are from 
a supply
-
demand poi
nt of view on iPad is that we, somewhere during the 
quarter, entered a supply
-
demand balance and stayed there for the balance 
of the quarter. If you recall on the last call, I said that we were coming in 
balance in a few countries. And then sometime therea
fter, I think that we 
went into a supply
-
demand balance around the world. And you can look at 
the share numbers that third parties have reported, and we're doing 
extremely well there. We feel 
--
 
we couldn't feel better honestly. And the 
extent of the usage
, the comScore group said that 97% of the web usage of 
tablets in the U.S. is from the iPad, so it's just mind
-
boggling. So we feel 
very, very good about that. In terms of the other countries outside of China, 
we have already started placing efforts in the
 
places that I mentioned. It's 
not something that we are going to start next week or so. It's something 
we've already done or I wouldn't have brought it up, frankly. Obviously, we 
wouldn't have done over $900 million in Brazil with no effort. There are 
som
e countries in the world that have protectionalist type of structures 
where the prices of the goods are extremely high if there's not local content 
involved. And so we'll assess each of those and decide what's in our best 
interest. But today, I don't have 
anything to report there. The basic 
approach in all of the countries are the same as the game plan that we used 
in China, and it's just a matter of the course, the rate and pace of the rollout 
and whether to involve every one of the things that we did in C
hina. In 
China, we picked everything that we knew to do. We are building retail. We 
went in with an online store. We're building an APR channel. We're building a 
third
-
party channel. We're doing significant advertising. We're really doing 
everything basica
lly that we're doing in the United States, we're doing in 
China. We would not be doing that in each of the other countries I named, 
but we would be doing portions of that and have already started to achieve 
the numbers that we did last year.

Tim, I was wondering first call as CEO, any thoughts on, any different 
strategy as far as cash allocation goes? And by that, I mean, 
dividend and a 
possible share buyback and maybe talk about these supplier investments 
also. And then the second question is, you mentioned the tablet market 
potentially being even bigger than the PC market at some point. Can you 
discuss the cannibalization
 
levels that you think you're seeing right now 
versus the PC market?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Let me start with the second question first. I do believe that we're seeing 
cannibalization. I think that it's showing up in 2 ways. I think that some 
people are electing 
to buy an iPad rather than a Mac. However, I believe a 
materially larger number of people are electing to buy an iPad instead of a 
Windows
-
based PC. And so I think we are overwhelmingly coming out very, 
very well in that cannibalization question. And I wou
ld point out that despite 
that, the Mac had its best quarter by far ever last quarter. And so even with 
having the best quarter on iPad with some cannibalizations in Mac, the Mac 
has its best quarter ever, which is almost unbelievable. And so with 
cannibal
ization like this, I hope it continues. On your cash question, to date 
as you know, we've wanted to maintain flexibility. I think everyone that 
knows us knows that the cash isn't burning a hole in our pocket and we're 
not the type of people to do silly thi
ngs with it. We invest it conservatively. 
If you look at Gary and his team's track record, they've done a phenomenal 
job in a extremely difficult market for the last few years. We've also taken 
money and done things with it that are in Apple's best interes
t. For example, 
we've acquired several companies. We've acquired some IP as you know. 
We've invested in the supply chain, and we used money to build out our 
stores and provide for a lot of new product tooling and the like. And so I 
believe what we're doing
 
with cash, the way we're 
--
 
this cash that we do 
spend we're doing an extremely good job of it and we're very frugal about 
using it and using it in the right places. That said, I'm not religious about 
holding cash or not holding it. I'm religious about a 
lot of things but not that 
one. And so we will continually ask ourselves what's in Apple's best interest 
and always do what we believe is in Apple's best interest. And so it's a topic 
for the board on an ongoing basis, and we'll continue to discuss it.
 
Pet
er Oppenheimer
 
Scott, I'd like to add to Tim's answer, just to remind everybody that of the 
little over $81 billion of cash that we ended in the September quarter with, a 
bit more than $54 billion or 2/3 of that was offshore.

Tim, just following up on your last question, maybe I'll just ask this just 
absolutely directly. Is buying back shares with your cash, which seems to be 
sort of
 
the thing that everybody wants you to do, at least certain investors 
want you to do it, is that perhaps kind of a philosophical white flag that 
you're not able to create value through product innovation?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Mike, I think anyone looking at us 
and the track record that we've got would 
not come to any conclusion that we're waving a white flag on innovation. 
We've had a series of unbelievable products that we believe the best 
products in the world and our customers tell us that, which is more 
impo
rtantly than us saying it, and we've got a pipeline that's unbelievable.
 
Mike Abramsky

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
Sorry, Tim. I didn't mean to convey that you were doing that. I meant to say 
that would that be holding you back philosophi
cally from buying back 
shares?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
No, I view those to be totally separate and distinct things. So no, I don't 
believe it sends that 
--
 
it certainly doesn't send that signal from my point of 
view. The cash is always a topic, and we'll always co
nclude to do what we 
think is in Apple's best interest. And I think we've done that so far, and if 
you look at where we've spent it, I think it's 
--
 
I think you would agree.

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
Okay. And then the ori
ginal goal for the iPhone, at the time it was obviously 
classed as audacious, with 1% of the market in the first fiscal year after 
launch. And you achieved 5x that, Tim. In the recent presentation when you 
highlighted that, there's 95% of the market to go.
 
I'm wondering if in your 
minds you have established a similarly audacious goal for the next couple of 
years for market penetration.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Not one that I published, but we want the iPhone to be in as many 
customers' hands as possible because we t
hink it's the greatest phone by 
far. And that's why we live to do that. And so yes, we aspire to much larger 
volumes than where we are. And we think the smartphone market will 
eventually absorb the handset market. As I made a point in that 
presentation, th
e handset market is this huge market. It's 1.5 billion 
handsets. And the smartphone market, depending upon which service you 
believe, is a bit over 400 million or so. And so there's a huge growth in the 
smartphone market, and then we think that we can also
 
grow within the 
sector at all. But the big win is to eat into the 1.5 billion and not just for us 
but I think for others as well, and we are very focused on doing that. You 
can tell that with the moves that we've made recently.

I have 2. Peter, first for you. Is the extra week for the quarter truly linear on 
both the revenues and the expenses? And included, the reason I'm asking is 
just trying to set u
p, if you will, for the March quarter, the potential impact 
of that extra week on the March quarter.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure, Keith. The 14th week will conclude on New Year's Eve day, which has 
traditionally been a good sell
-
through week for us but not typi
cally as strong 
as the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas day. We'll provide further 
details on our January call about what we actually saw. That's some 
indication in terms of what we would see for sell
-
through. For our expenses, 
we certainly will ha
ve variable expenses and payroll expenses for that 14th 
week. But some of our fixed cost such as leases and rents and such are 
fixed, so there will be a benefit there as well.
 
Keith F. Bachman

BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
Okay. And my follow
-
up is on Japan. 
In terms of the year
-
over
-
year and 
sequential changes, there was a bigger disparity on units versus revenues, 
CPU units versus total revenues in Japan. I was just wondering if you could 
speak to that if you could.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
I'm sorry?
 
Keith F. 
Bachman 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
In terms of the revenue performance in Japan, it looked to be a bigger 
disparity between the units and the revenues than was true in the other 
regions. I was just wondering why the bigger disparity in Japan. Was it FX, 
or
 
was it other reasons?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
A huge percentage of Japan's total revenue in the year
-
ago quarter was 
from the iPhone 4 launch. It was iPhone 4's first quarter as you know. And 
so when you do a year
-
over
-
year compare, that adversely affects the 
rev
enue compare. The Mac, however, had an incredible quarter growing at 
48% in a market that is barely growing at all. And so we gained significant 
share on the Mac side of the business. The iPhone was a negative year
-
over
-
year compare, but we have gotten off
 
to an unbelievable start in Japan. It 
was one of the first 7 countries, and it's very clear that Japan is yet another 
example of the delay that we were speaking about earlier.
 
Keith F. Bachman 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
Okay. So the sequential was then th
ere was perhaps a larger delay in Japan 
for the iPhone 4S than other regions. Is that the way to think about it?

Think about it that iPhone is a bigger portion of the revenue [indiscernible].

Tim, I wanted to ask about the medium to longer term iPad opportunity as 
you see it from an ASP standpoint or segmentation standpoint. And by that, 
I mean, do you see more opportunity
 
to move that product downmarket to 
drive elasticity, or upmarket to take on more of the 
--
 
or greater percentage 
on the PC market?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
I don't want to get into what we might do, which that answer might do. But 
let me just go back to 
--
 
we see 
the tablet market as a huge market, and we 
could not be happier with our position in it. And we've got some fantastic 
things in the pipeline. And after selling 40 million in the first 18 months, 
which is more than our wildest dreams were and selling 3 out 
of every 4, I 
think we've got a fairly good handle on what to do next.
 
Chris Whitmore

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Okay. Perhaps I can ask an initial feedback or expectations around the lower 
price points of the iPhone business into emerging marke
ts. Can you 
comment at all or give some color on carrier receptivity of that pricing 
change and any acceleration in carrier engagements on the back of that?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Let me 
--
 
maybe I can answer that in 2 ways. If you look at the channel 
inventory o
n iPhone that was there at the end of Q4, and so this is at the 
September 24 cutoff point for our quarter, that was the 5.75 million that 
Peter mentioned in his opening comments. Over half of that has already sold 
through. And so one portion of the things 
driving that is the elasticity 
question that you're getting at there. We also did in a very few countries last 
quarter, we dropped the 3GS price a bit early particularly in some of the 
prepaid markets to see what would occur on those markets, and we were 
e
xtremely pleased with the results. It gave us even more conviction to follow 
through with the plan change that we made earlier in October.

Tim Cook
 
 
Thanks, Nancy and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. 
We are incredibly pleased to report an extraordinary quarter with $54.5 
billion in revenue and new records for iPhone and th
e iPad sales. No 
technology company has ever reported these kinds of results.
 
 
Apple is in one of the most prolific periods of innovation of new products in 
its history. Just in the last few months, we have introduced new products in 
every category that we
 
make. Each one of these reflects our dedication to 
making the very best products in the world. At Apple, we think about the 
smallest details and we are unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best 
customer experience in the world. This relentless commi
tment to innovation 
and excellence is the reason our customers choose to buy our product and 
this will always be the driving force behind Apple.
 
 
Apple today is over 80,000 people strong and we are one team working 
together to surprise and delight our cust
omers. Part of my job is to preserve 

company. People join Apple to do the very best work of their life and there is 
no greater reward than seeing how customers love to use our produ
cts. We 
continue to believe that our fundamental, our remarkable people, our clear 
and focused strategy, our new product pipeline, our booming ecosystem, 
and more than 400 Apple retail stores will serve us well in the coming 
months and years ahead.
 
 
Tomorr
ow marks the anniversary of a revolution. On January 24, 1984, 
Steve introduced the first Macintosh right here at a shareholder meeting in 
Cupertino. On the evening news that night, they said it was supposed to be 
one of the easiest computers to use, and t
hanks to the new mouse, you 
hardly have to touch the keyboard. We have come a long way since 1984, 
but we rely on the same spirit and drive that brought the original Mac and 
other revolutionary products like the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad into the 
world
.
 
 
You are going to hear a lot of impressive numbers during this call, but they 
are not the only way that we measure success at Apple. The most important 
thing to us is that our customers love our product, not just buy them, but 
love them. Everyone here is
 
laser focused on creating an unprecedented 
customer experience. We have now sold well over 0.5 billion iOS devices, 

achieved these milestones without the very best products in the w
orld and 
unmatched execution by our engineering operations and sales teams to 

phenomenal.
 
 
Everyone at Apple has their eyes on the future, a future driven by the 
incredible hard work
 
and dedication by the most talented and creative team 


proud to share with you our latest results. Peter
 
will review the highlights of 

 
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
 

quarter. We established new all
-
time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad 
sales, significantly broadened our eco
-

quarterly revenue and net income ever. Revenue for the quarter was 54.5 
billion compared to 46.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 8.2 
billion year
-
over
-
year. As a re
mainder our first quarter this fiscal year 
spanned 13 weeks whereas the first quarter last year included a 14th week. 
As such average weekly revenue was 4.2 billion in the current year quarter 
compared to 3.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of
 
27%. The 
strong year
-
over
-
year growth was fuelled by record iPhone, iPad and iTune 
sales.
 
 
Operating margin was 17.2 billion representing 31.6% of revenue. Net 
income was a record 13.1 billion just ahead of the amount generated in last 

ter and translated to diluted earnings per share of 


operating segment of Greater China given the very sign
ificant contribution of 
that region to our overall business. We define Greater China to include 
Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Second, for segment reporting 

cost related to
 
product tooling and manufacturing process equipment to our 
operating segments instead of including these expenditures in corporate 
expenses as we have done in the past.
 
 
We have recast our operating income for each quarter in fiscal 2011 and 
2012 to refle
ct this change and have provided a reconciliation on 
Apple.com/Investor. These changes have no impact in overall reported 
operating income. And third, we have realigned the presentation of product 
information in our summary data schedule to provide greater
 
visibility to 
revenue by product category. Under this new format revenue from iPhone, 
iPad, Mac and iPod sales is presented exclusive of related service and 
accessory revenue. All revenue from iTunes, stand
-
alone Apple and third 
party software and service
s is presented as a single line item and revenue 
from all Apple and third party accessory sales is presented as a single line 
item.
 
We believe this presentation provides a logical grouping of revenue sources 
and also provides greater transparency into our 
results.
 
As for the details of this quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We were very 
pleased to sell 47.8 million iPhones compared to 37 million in the year ago 
quarter, an increase of over 10 million iPhones.
 
 
This represents a rate of almost 3.7 mill
ion iPhones per week in the current 
year quarter compared to 2.6 million per week in the year ago quarter. 

published forecast for the global smartphone market in the December 
quarter.
 
 
And on a sequential basis iPhone sales grew 78% over the September 

sequential growth of the overall market resulting in iPhone market share 
growth. We experienced strong iPhone
 
growth in each of our geographic 
segments most notably Greater China where iPhone sales more than 
doubled year
-
over
-
year. In the U.S. Kantar Worldpanel Comtech estimates 
that iPhone shares of smartphones sales increased from 45% in the year ago 
quarter to
 
over 51% in the current year quarter.
 
 
iPhone sales were driven by the tremendous popularity of iPhone 5 which 

December resulting in the fastest iPhone rollout ever. We ended the quarte
r 
with about 10.6 million iPhones in channel inventory a sequential increase of 
about 1.5 million iPhones and ended the quarter within our target range of 
four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis. While 
other mobile devices and
 
operating systems faced increasing security risks 
and fragmented inconsistent user experiences, iPhone and iOS continued to 
deliver an exceptional experience that people love.
 
 
They also provide a secure and trusted eco
-
system that IT departments 
require.
 
iPhone continues to be embraced by government agencies and 
businesses across the globe. Many U.S. government agencies are issuing 
iPhones by the 1000s as part of their new mobile strategies. Some examples 
include NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
 
Association, 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security 
Administration.
 
 
We are also seeing continued iPhone growth in business across the board 
from companies replacing existing smartphone deployments to businesses 
adding first
-
time smartphone users. Companies around the world like 
Neiman Marcus, Skanska, and Volvo are issuing iPhones to their employees 
to improve interactions with customers and give workers access to essential 
corporate data.
 
 
Turning to iPad, we were thrilled t
o sell 22.9 million iPads during the quarter 
compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to over 1.7 
million iPads per week in the current year quarter compared to 1.1 million 
per week in the year ago quarter, an average increase of 6
0% per week, 

market. Customers are loving the fourth generation iPad with its faster 
performance and spectacular Retina display. And the iPad mini has been a 
tremendous hit offering the 
full iPad experience in an incredible design that 
you can hold in one hand.
 
 
In addition to the tremendous response from consumers, iPad continues to 
be the tablet of choice for businesses and government agencies transforming 
the way their employees work. 
Financial institutions like Barclays, Nomura 
Securities, and Bank of Beijing are deploying iPad to enable employees to 
better service customers and work securely with financial portfolios and 
products. In particular, Barclays roll out of over 8000 iPads ha
s generated 
tremendous employee engagement and feedback making it the most 

 
State and local governments in the United States are also rapidly adopting 
iPad. Court systems, county inspectors, and law enforcement
 
agencies use 
iPad to streamline processes and replace huge amounts of paper. And state 
legislatures in Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia are all using iPads to give 
lawmakers instant access to government documents and information.
 
 
Outside the U.S., 10,0
00 iPads are being deployed as part of broad adoption 
of a local government workflow solution in Sweden and over 5,000 iPads 
have been purchased by the government in the Netherlands for the Dutch 
Tax Authority and the Dutch Court System. We began and ended
 
the quarter 
with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory. That left us below our 
target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look
-
forward 
basis.
 
 
Turning to Mac, we sold 4.1 million units in the quarter compared to 5.2 
million in
 
the year ago quarter. IDC estimates the global personal computer 
market contracted by 6% during the December quarter. We introduced the 
new 13
-
inch MacBook Pro Retina display as well as our stunning new iMacs 
in October. As we projected a quarter ago, we 
were significantly constrained 
with respect to the new iMacs and were only able to ship them for the final 
month of the December quarter. We believe our Mac sales would have been 
much higher absent those constraints. We began and ended the quarter with 
bet
ween three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look
-
forward 
basis, which is below our target range of four to five weeks.
 
 
Moving to iPod, we sold 12.7 million iPods compared to 15.4 million in the 
year ago quarter. iPod touch was a popular item i
n the holiday season and 
continues to account for over of half of all iPods sold during the December 

December quarter based on the latest data published by MPD and iPod 
continued to b
e the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based 
on the latest data published by GFK.
 
 
iTunes generated record results with revenue of $2.1 billion in the quarter. 
We established new all
-
time quarterly records for revenue from music, from 
movi
es, and from apps. We significantly expanded the footprint of our 
ecosystem during the quarter adding iTunes music stores in 56 countries, 
including Russia, Turkey, India and South Africa. That brings us to a total of 
119 countries, where customers can cho
ose from over 20 million songs to 
purchase and download.
 
 
The App Store had a record
-
breaking December quarter with over 2 billion 
downloads in the month of December alone. The App Store now offers more 
than 775,000 apps to over 0.5 billion accountholders 
in 155 countries, 
including over 300,000 native iPad apps. Cumulative app downloads have 

developers over 7 billion for sales of their incredible work. iPod continues to 
grow at amazing rate 
now with 250 million accounts and our customers love 

 
 
I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue was in all
-
time 
high of over 6.4 billion with growth yield prima
rily by record iPhone and iPad 
sales. We opened in total 11 new stores during the quarter including four 
new stores in Greater China. We excited the quarter with 401 stores, a 150 
of which are outside United States. We also relocated or expanded 14 stores 
that had outgrown their former space during the quarter. With an average of 
396 stores opened, average revenue per store was 16.3 million or 1.25 
million per store per week compared to 1.22 million per store per week in 
the year ago quarter. Retail segment
 
income was 1.6 billion.
 
 
We hosted a record 121 million visitors to our stores during the quarter 
compared to a 110 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to 23,000 
visitors per store per week, a 7% increase year

argin was 38.6% which was about 260 basis points higher than our 
guidance. About half of this difference were driven by lower products and 
transitory cost that we reflected in our guidance while the remainder 

r U.S. dollar and leverage on 
the higher revenue.
 
 
Operating expenses were 3.9 billion included 460 million in stock based 
compensation expense. (Inaudible) was 462 million and the tax rate for the 
quarter was 26%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short term
 
and long term 
marketable securities totaled a 137.1 billion at the end of the December 
quarter compared to a 121 billion at the end of the September quarter, a 
sequential increase of almost 16 billion.
 
 
The increase in cash was net of 2.5 billion in divid
ends paid and 2 billion in 
an upfront payment in conjunction with our accelerated share repurchase 
program. Over 94 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the 
December quarter. Cash flow from operations was a record 23.4 billion 
growing by al
most 6 billion year

year of 33% increase. Our Board of 
Directors has declared a dividend of $2.55 for common share payable on 
February 14th, 2013 the shareholders at record as of the close of business 
on February 11th, 2013.
 
 
As we move ahead into the
 
March quarter I would like to review our outlook 
which includes the types of forward

looking information that Nancy referred

changing our approach to how we provide guidance. In recent years our 
guidance reflected a conservative point estimate of results every quarter 
that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. Going forward we plan to 
provide a ran

achieve.
 

report within the range of guidance we provide. Therefore for the March 

nce of between 41 billion and 43 
billion compared to 39.2 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross 
margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5% reflecting approximately 90 million 
related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be 
between 3.
8 billion and 3.9 billion including about 480 million related to 
stock based compensation.
 
 
We expect other income/(expense) to be about $350 million and we expect 

over 54 billion of
 
revenue in a 13 week period while executing multiple 
major product transitions. We sold over 75 million iOS devices during the 

ever and the execution by our engineering, operations an
d sales teams to 
deliver 10s of millions of such innovative, beautifully designed products in 

iPhone and iPad sales, our record music moving and app sales and continued

our new product pipeline.

September quarter, which was 3.5 times market. And so we could not be 
happier with that. In
 
terms of the geographic distribution, we saw our

And then maybe
 
a question for Peter, with such a large cash generation 
again this quarter and confidence in the product pipeline, you made those

even more stock than you had originally planned a
t this point?
 
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
 
Sure. Kate, this is something that we continuously assess the opportunities 
to both invest in the business and return cash. We are pleased to have 
started our share repurchase program this quarter. And combined with our 
di
vidend, we returned about $4.5 billion of cash this quarter and we started 
the buyback program and expect to return about $45 billion over three years

Okay, great. Thank you. Katy
 
had alluded to this, many of your smartphone 
competitors are now focusing on differentiating themselves with larger 
screen sizes than that of the iPhone 5 in your predecessor products. I mean, 
how do you think about the competitive dynamics for the market
 
right now? 

you think there is a long
-
term case for a larger screen size or at least the 
larger variety of screen sizes for iPhones and for the smartphone category in 
general?

inch Retina 
display, which is the most advanced display in the industry and no one 
comes close to matching the level of quality as the Retina display. It also 
provides a larger screen size
 
for iPhone customers without sacrificing the 
one headed ease
-
of
-
use that our customers love. So, we put a lot of thinking 

 
 
Bill Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
 
I guess, and then shifting on to the question o
n iPhone demand, obviously 
you saw healthy growth in the key categories this quarter, but in the context 
of your guidance, can you give us some color about how you are viewing in
-
demand trends for the iPhone coming out of the December quarter and how 
that 
compares to what you consider to be normal seasonality at this point in 
the product cycle? And also did you see any meaningful deterioration in 
iPhone demand at the end of the December quarter or thus far in the March 
quarter that would lend credence to so
me near
-
term conservatism?
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 
Bill, let me take the second half of that and then I will hand it back to Peter 
for the first half. If you look at the iPhone sales across the quarter, we were 
very constrained for much of the quarter on iPhone 5. As w
e began to 
produce more and ship more sales went up with the production. iPhone 4 
was actually in constraint for the entire quarter and sales remained strong, 

about the guidance.
 
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
 
So, Bill for iPhone, as we told you last year, we built about 2.6 million units 
of channel inventory in the March quarter, which allowed us at that time to 
get into our four to six
-
week inventory target. So, the underlying sell
-
through
 
was about 32.5 million and we would expect sell
-
through growth 
year
-
over
-
year as it has for 

 
in the quarter as it has for many quarters in a 
row.
 
 
Bill Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
 
Okay, thank you.
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 
But Bill, let me make one additional point on this,
 
I know there has been lots 
of rumors about order cuts and so forth and so let me just take a moment to 

because I would spend my life doing that but I would suggest it's good to 
quest
ion the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans and also stress 
that even if a particular data point were factual it would be impossible to 
accurately interpret the data point as to what it meant for our overall 
business because the supply chain is
 
very complex and we obviously have 
multiple sources for things, yields might vary, supply performance can vary. 
The beginning inventory positions can vary, I mean there is just an 
inordinate long list of things that would make any single data point not a

I just wanted to make sure that I fully understand your
 
comments about a 

effectively saying that when you provided guidance before it was uniquely 

getting the real plan
ning range for Apple and that this is fundamentally 
different from how you approached and provided guidance.
 
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
 

guidance, it was conservative then we had reasonable con
fidence in 


forecasting is difficult but we believe that we will report within that range.
 
 
Toni Sacconag

you 
-
 
I think on average eclipsed your guidance by on EPS by 35%, was the 
guidance before something that you felt reasonably confident in achieving or 
was t

that you said you thought it was reasonable before but your historical 
precedent was, you eclipsed it enormously on an ongoing basis and this time 

ihood of falling within the range and I want 
to understand the distinction.
 
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
 
I will go through it again, in the past we gave you a single point estimate of 
guidance, it was conservative that we had reasonable confidence as you can 
have t

that we expect to as best we can report within.
 
 
Toni Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
 
Okay and then if I could follow
-
up Tim you started up the call talking about 

y ensuring that you satisfy your customers and 
making great products. Against that backdrop how important is market 
share preservation. This quarter you held share maybe increased it 
fractionally on a year
-
over
-
year basis in the global smartphone market bu
t 
clearly you had an exciting new product. Is holding share in the smartphone 
market in 2013 a priority for Apple, yes or no and why? And realistically how 
does Apple hold share given that the market segment and price point that 
you play in is expected to 
grow a lot slower and you have pretty dominant 
share in that high end.
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 
Toni the most important thing to Apple is to make the best products in the 


 
revenue for revenue sake, we could put the Apple brand 

want to make only the best products and so what does that mean for market 


here on iPod doing different products at different price points and getting a 

things as mutually exclusive as some might, but the high order bit is m
aking 

focused on.

Thanks Tony. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
 

es.
 
 
Ben Reitzes 
-
 
Barclays
 
 
Yeah, thanks a lot. First question is with regard to Macs, could you talk a 
little bit more about what happened and it would seem that the shortfall 
there is well over $1 billion in the quarter or maybe even as much as a $1.5 
b
illion and how much of that was pushed into the March quarter within that 
new March guidance? Thanks.
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 

this, as if you look at the previous year, our Mac sales were abou
t $5.2 
million. This year, they were $4.1 million and so the difference is $1.1 
million. And so let me try to bridge that. iMacs were down by 700,000 units 
year
-
over
-
year. As you remember, we announced the new iMacs late in 
October and when we announced th
ose, we announced that they would ship, 
the first one, the 21.5
-
inch would ship in November and we did ship it at the 
end of November, we announced that the 27
-
inch would ship in December 
and we did ship that in mid
-
December. And so there were limited week
s of 
ramping on these products during the quarter, we left the quarter with 
significant constraints on the iMac. And we believe we know that our sales 
would have been materially higher if those constraints would not have exist. 
We tried to tell people this
 
on the conference call in October, I think I said 
that we would have significant constraints on iMacs, but I recognized to 
some folks this maybe to surprise.
 
 
Number two, if you look at last year, as Peter went through in his opening 
comments we had 14 we
eks in the quarter. We have 13 weeks in the 
quarter this year. Last year, in the average week, we sold 370,000 Macs. 
The third part of the bridge here would be that our channel inventory was 
down from the beginning of the quarter by over 100,000 units. And
 


significant constraint. So, if you just take these three factors, they bridge 
more than the difference of between this year sales and last year sales.
 
 
Now, in addition to these th
ree points, I would point out two other things, 
and these are lesser things than these other than the total of these other 

believe was around negative 6%. Two, we sold 23 million iPads
 
and we 
obviously could have sold more than this, because we could not build 
enough iPad minis to come into a demand balance. And so there was 

 
we 
have always said there is some cannibalization there. I am sure there was 
some cannibalization of Macs there
, but the three large factors of it, the 
aggregated totals of three large, the iMac, the difference in seven days of 
the previous year having seven extra days and the channel inventory, I think 
more than explains the difference between this year and the pr
evious year. 
As a side note, if you looked at our portables alone, they were in line with 

 
 
Ben Reitzes 
-
 
Barclays
 
 
Okay, thanks a lot Tim. And then just my follow
-
up is with regard to web 
services, online services, there
 
has been a lot of publicity around maps and 
can you give us an update there? And then looking forward how does the 
year look in terms of innovation, in terms of iOS 7 and your online and web 
services, how will that drive Apple?
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 
Well, let me sta
rt with the second part of this. We are working on some 
incredible stuff. The pipeline is chock
-

specific product, but we feel great about what we have got in store. In terms 
of Maps, we have made a number of improvemen
ts to Maps since the 
introduction of iOS 6 back in September and will roll out even more 
improvements across the rest of the year and we are going to keep working 
on this as I have said before until it lives up to our incredibly high standards. 
Users can a
lready see many of these improvements because they include 
things like improved satellite and improved imaginary and improved 
categorization, improved local information for 1000s of businesses and so 
forth. The usage in maps is significantly higher than it
 
was prior to iOS 6. In 



sent over 450 bi


apps on the App Store with over 40 billion downloads and so I feel really, 
really great about it, there is obviously 
more stuff we can do and you can 

 
 
Nancy Paxton
 
 
Can we have the next question please?
 
 
Operator
 
 

 
 
Steve Milunovich 

 
UBS
 
 
Could you review your comments about gross margin in 
the quarter and also 

on your product cost curve, where you expected to be and then also any 
comments on mix within the iPhone line in terms of 5 versus 4s, amount of 
storage and then
 

know what the proportion of minis would be, can you make any comments in 
terms of the demand for mini relative to what you expected?
 
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
 

make a comment on mini gross margin 
and maybe Tim can pick up on some of your iPhone questions. With the iPad 
mini it's hard to know, we could not make enough in the quarter. We were 
constrained every week. Customers love the mini and we wish that we could
 
have made more and we ended the quarter with significant backlog. For the 
gross margin in the December quarter we were about 260 basis points 
ahead of our guidance, about half this difference was driven by lower 
product in transitory cost and we had refle
cted in our guidance and the rest 

higher revenue.
 
 
As we look forward we think the gross margin will be somewhere between 
about 10 basis points and a 110 basis points lower sequentiall
y. We believe 
that there are two primary factors that will benefit gross margins 
sequentially, first being the largest of the two. Our teams have made 
meaningful progress in reductions in product and transitory cost from the 
actions that they have been wor
king on to get down to the cost curve. So we 
expect the benefit in the March quarter beyond what we saw in the 
December quarter and second we expect a more typical level of deferred 
revenue from device sales. We expect these factors to be more than offset 
by 10 to a 120 basis points by the loss of leverage coming out of the 
December quarter which is very typical for us and a different mix of our 
current products.
 
 
And regarding mix as an example as we indicated last quarter the iPad mini 
gross margin is sig
nificantly below the corporate average and we expect to 
be able to meet demand for this product in the March quarter which again 
we could not in the December quarter.
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 
Steve I will make some comments on mix, if you look, your question on 
iPhone m
ix I will bring up three points, one the ASP for iPhone was 
essentially the same year
-
over
-
year in the quarter that we just finished. 
Underneath that if you looked at the mix of iPhone 5 to total iPhone and in 
the previous year you look at 4s to total iPho
ne to the iPhone those mixes 
are similar and then thirdly I think you asked about capacities, in Q1 we saw 
similar results as we saw in Q1 at the previous year. So does that answer 
your question on mix?
 
 
Steve Milunovich 
-
 
UBS
 
 
Yes it does. Thank you. And 
then second question would be on CapEx, you 


as soon I buy an equipment for your partners, could you talk ab
out the 
strategy here and how much of a differentiator this gives Apple in terms of 
your ability to ramp new products over time? And maybe a little bit more 
about how deep you will go in terms of semiconductor components for you, 
etcetera?

Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what happened last year 
in terms of the refresh cycle where you had about 80% of your revenue 
refresh in the last
 
few months? And then how you are thinking about it this 
year, I mean, I know you say you shipped products and they are ready, but 
I mean is this a situation where you are going to try to stagger it out a little 
bit this year or will it be sort of a simila
r situation to 2012?
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 
The question I want to answer Shannon, but the 80% was a unusually high 

but I can tell you that the number of ramps were unprecedented in the fact 
th
at we had new products in every category is something we have not done 
before. We feel great to have delivered so many products for the holiday 
season though and our customers have certainly expressed joy over it.

talk about what you are hearing from customers and from some of your 
partners there, your thoughts on retail distr
ibution and expansion and just 
sort of overall, what you are seeing over, what you saw for the holiday 
period, and then what you sort of expect from China going forward?
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 
Yeah. If you look at our total China, total Greater China, which would incl
ude 
our retail stores that are in China. Our revenues were $7.3 billion in the 

-
on
-
year. And 


We saw exceptional growth in iPhones into the 
triple digits. iPad, we shipped iPad very late in the quarter in December, and 
despite that, saw very nice growth. We are expanding in Apple retail there. 
In the year ago quarter, we had 6 stores we now have 11
. We obviously 
have many more to open there. In our premium resellers, we went over 
400, up from a little over 200 in the previous year. And we increased iPhone 


 
not the final by any means, we are not even close to 
that, but we are making, I feel that we are making great progress that was 
just over there recently. And I was talking to a lot of different people and I 
am very happy with how things are going.

Hey good afternoon. Tim, you made comments in the past that the Apple TV 
experience is dated and Apple wants to fix that problem, if we can take a 
step 

in high level how important this market is to Apple, number one? And 
number two is can you accomplish what you ultimately want to accomplish 
with the reality of where content is toda
y, and how content is distributed?
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 

I can find some comments to make that productive. In terms of the product 
that we sell today, the Apple TV we sold more last quarter 

sold before, eclipsing 2 million during the quarter. It was up almost 60% 
year
-
on
-
year and so there is actually very, very good growth in that product 
and what was the small niche at one time the people that loved it is a much 
larger number
 
some of it, I have said in the past this is an area of intense 
interest for us and it remains that and I tend to believe that the, there is a 
lot we can contribute in this space and so we continue to pull the string and 

ant to be more specific.

Okay and just a house
-
keeping for Peter, Peter you gave gross margin 
guidance this quarter but no EPS guidance, is there anything, any moving 
parts between the gross margin and the operating line that
 
we should be 

guidance?
 
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
 
No Gene, the our prior method of providing guidance was a point estimate 
for each line item of the P&L including EPS and our guidance for the
 
March 

range for revenue, for gross margin and for OpEx and therefore there are 
many possibilities for EPS within the range that will leave you to think 

ctual results for March and April.

seasonality would be and more importantly how are thinking about
 
the 

amount increase, decrease or stay the same as we reflect on how to model 
units in the March quarter.
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 

very 
constrained. We ended with underneath our target channel inventory rank 
which Peter has commented earlier. We believe that we can achieve supply 
demand balance on iPad mini later this quarter that was likely mean that we 
would need more units in the c
hannel than we have today I think that would 
be a fair conclusion to draw.

in iPad sales but a post

which I think is typical and as Tim said we expect to be able to meet 
demand for the mini.

Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, Tim ca
n you maybe discuss the tablet market 
a little bit in relation to Macs and other PCs is sort of how you are thinking 
about the cannibalization of that market for the iPad relative to the PC 
market? And then secondly, typically each quarter, you sort of tal
k about 
some of the component constraints and you certainly talked about iPhone 4 
being constrained and the iPad mini is better, so as you enter into the 
quarter where do you see the challenges for meeting demand for the 
calendar first quarter? Thanks.
 
Tim
 
Cook
 
Sure. Let me take the second part of that first. I think overall our team did 
just a fantastic job ramping a record number of new products during the 
quarter. We did have significant shortages due to robust demand on both 
iPad mini and both models of
 
the iMac that persisted the entire quarter. And 
we are still short of both of those today as the matter of fact. Additionally, 
supply of iPhone 5 which short to demand until late in the quarter and 
iPhone 4 was short for the entire quarter, we believe tha
t we can achieve a 
supply demand balance on iPad mini during this quarter and on iPhone 4 
during this quarter. On iMac, we are confident that we are going to 
significantly increase the supply, but the demand here is very strong and we 
are not certain that 
we will achieve a supply demand balance during the 
quarter.
 
In terms of cannibalization and how we think about this, I see 
cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us. One, our base philosophy is to 
never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will
 
just cannibalize it 
and so we never fear it. We know that iPhone has cannibalized some iPod 


the mother of
 
all opportunities here, because the Windows market is much, 
much larger than the Mac market is. And I think it is clear that it is clear that 

more opportunity there. And as you know,
 
I have said for two or three, 
actually three years now I believe that I believe the tablet market will be 
larger than the PC market at some point. And I still believe that. And you 
can see by the growth in tablets and the pressure on PCs that those lines 
are 
beginning to converge.
 
And I think the other thing for us maybe not for others, but for us is if 

we had great experience through the years of knowing that when somebody 
buys
 
their first Apple product that a percentage of these people windup 
buying another type of Apple product. And so if you remember what we had 
termed the halo effect for some time with the iPod, with the Mac, we are 
very confident that, that will happen and 
we are seeing some evidence of 
that on the iPad as well. And so I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity.

Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Question Tim around the iPhone, Peter gave 
some transparency around the qualitative sequential and year
-
over

year 
potential increases in the iPad for the March quarter. How should we think 
about the iPhone family against t
hat in terms of year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter potential increases or decreases, and are there any sort of 
dynamics around slower pace of LTE rollouts by the network carriers having 
an impact?
 
Tim Cook
 
The thing to consider on iPhone market is tha
t in the year ago quarter, we 
have built 2.6 million units of channel inventory, because we did the 

 
one 
reason was that we did the launch in the March quarter instead of in the 
previous quarter. And so the underlying sales growth from the year ago 
quarte
r was 32.5, the sell

in was 35 as you can probably see on a sheet in 
front of you. And so in thinking through, the number of iPhones to predict 
we looked at the 32.5 number We believe we'll grow year over year, but 
don't want to be more specific than that.
 
We guide in the aggregate instead 
of the product level.

And the pace of LTE rollout around the world, has slower rollout had impact 
on iPhone sales philosophy? Could that change?
 
 
Tim Cook
 
 
Today we have 24 carriers on LTE arou
nd the world for iPHone 5. Those are 
in countries like the US, Korea, UK, Germany, Canada, Japan and Australia 
and a few others. Next week, we are adding 36 more carriers for LTE 
support. And these carriers will be in countries that were currently not 
supp
orting LTE, so the LTE coverage now as of next week in Italy, Denmark, 
Finland, Switzerland, Philippines, also several Middle Eastern countries. And 
so if you look at the total of all of these and the incremental subscribers that 
are in those countries, th

of LTE rollouts that I am pleased to tell you about today. Also as you know, 
iPhone 5 also supports other ultra
-
fast networks HSPA+ and with downloads 
up to 42Mbps.

Thanks. Just a follow
-
up on the iPhone question with respect to the 
guidance, just, assuming t
here is some benefit from the Mac carryover effect 
and iPad release etcetera, and adjusting for the inventory, it seems you are 
guiding to kind of mid to high single
-
digit year
-
on
-
year unit growth for the 
iPhone business from a sell
-
through standpoint. Is 
that the right ballpark we 
should be thinking about and why the big deceleration from the 25% plus 
kind of weekly sales rate you quoted in your intro comments?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

 
product level, but let me give you some things we thought about in coming 
up with the range of $41 billion to $43 billion. It is that range is a 5% to 
10% year
-
over
-
year increase. And there are few factors that are impacting 
the year
-
over
-
year results mak
ing the strong performance of the business a 
little bit harder to see. So, let me point a few of these out. First of all, as we 
have talked about several times on the call, last year in the March quarter, 

entory, which allowed us to 
get into our 4 to 6
-
week range. That increased the revenue in the year ago 
quarter by $1.6 billion. And as Tim talked about that was sell
-
in that was not 
sell
-
through, we are thinking about the business on a sell
-
through basis. 
So, 

 
Second, the iPhone 5 rollout this year, has been our fastest ever. We are 
selling in 100 countries by the end of December. Last year, we did not 
achieve this country distribution until the March quarter, which inclu
ded 
China that we launched in January. Third, we made a very good strategic 
decision to introduce the iPad mini which customers love and to keep the 
price reduced iPad 2 in the line. As a result of this, we saw a reduction in our 
iPad ASPs of about $101 ye
ar
-
over
-
year in the December quarter. And you 
can see that, our iPad units grew faster than our iPad revenue in the 
December quarter. We would expect iPad ASPs to be down quite a bit in the 
March quarter on a year
-
over
-
year basis for the same reasons.
 
And 
then finally, the PC market grew 4% last year in the March quarter, and 
this year IDC is projecting that to decline by 3%. So, considering these 
factors, the underlying performance of the business is much stronger than 
the 5% to 10% year
-
over
-
year growth i
mplies and we remain very confident 
in our business and our new product pipeline.

And for my follow
-
up I wanted to come back to something Tim said earlier 
about that you are not fearing cannibalization; I wanted to ask in con
text of 
your iPhone business given the strength you are seeing at the low end of 
your product line the iPhone 4 being stocked out during the quarter. There 
seems to be a lot of demand at lower price points for the iPhone, why not 
get more aggressive at low
er price bands and move down market in the 
iPhone business? Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
I am not going to go into our pricing strategy, but we feel great about the 
opportunity of getting products to customers and a percentage of those 
buying other Apple products. And
 
that we have obviously seen evidence of 
that through history and continue to see evidence of that today.

Thanks, Nancy. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot 
of news to share with you today about the details of our March quarter as 
well as a significant increase to our capital return program.
 
First, I would like to talk about our business and the road ahead. We are 

e accomplished a tremendous 


revenue for the first half was over $98 billion and our net income was over 
$22 billion. During
 
that time, we sold 85 million iPhones and 42 million 
iPads. These are very, very large numbers, unimaginable even to us just a 
few years ago.
 
Despite producing results that met or beat our guidance as we have done 
consistently, we know they didn't meet ev
eryone's expectations, and though 

our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the 
exceptionally high level we experienced in 2012.
 
Our revenues grew about $13 bil
lion in the first half of this fiscal year. Even 

companies, our average weekly growth slowed to 19% and our gross 
margins are closer to the levels of a few years ago. Our fiscal 201
2 results 

Last year, our business benefited from both high growth and demand for 
products and a corresponding growth in channel inventories along with a 
richer
 
mix of higher gros
s margin products, a more favorable foreign 
currency environment, and historically low costs.
 
These compares are made further challenging until we anniversary the 
launch of the iPad mini, which as you know, we strategically priced at a 
lower margin. As Pet
er will discuss, we are guiding to flat revenues year over 
year for the June quarter along with a slight sequential decline in gross 
margins.
 

very frustrating to all of us. But Ap
ple remains very strong and we will 

rates and world economies and even certain cost pressures, but the most 
important objective for Apple will always be creating innovative products an
d 
that is directly within our control.
 
We will continue to focus on the long

term, and we remain very optimistic 
about our future. We are participating on large and growing markets. We see 
great opportunities in front of us, particularly given the long
-
ter
m prospects 
of the smartphone and tablet market, the strength of our incredible 
ecosystem, which we plan to continue to augment with new services, our 
plans for expanded distribution, and the potential of exciting new product 
categories.
 
Take the smartphon
e market for example, IDC estimates that this market 
will double between 2012 and 2016 to an incredible 1.4 billion units 
annually, and Gartner estimates that the tablet market is growing at an even 
faster rate from 125 million units in 2012 to a projected
 
375 million by 2016.
 
Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software, and 

continue to be very confident in our future product plans.
 
Apple has many distinct and u
nique advantages as the only company in the 
industry with world
-
class skills in hardware, software, and services. We have 
the strongest ecosystem in the industry with App Stores in 155 countries, 
iTunes music stores in 119 countries, hundreds of millions o
f iCloud users 
around the world, and most importantly, the highest loyalty and customer 
satisfaction rates in the business. And of course, we have a tremendous 

products that change pe


surprises in the works.
 
A little over a year ago, we announced a plan to return $45 billion to 
shareholders over three years. Since 
we began paying dividends last August 

under that program. We continue to generate cash in excess of our needs to 
operate the business, invest in our future, and maintain flexibility 
to take 
advantage of strategic opportunities.
 
We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns 
to shareholders through both our business performance and return of 
capital. So today, we are announcing an aggressive plan that more
 
than 
doubles the size of the capital return program we announced last year to a 
total of $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015. The vast majority of 
our incremental cash return will be in the form of share repurchases. As the 
Board and management 
team deliberated among the various alternatives to 
returning cash, we concluded that investing in Apple was the best.
 
In addition to the share repurchases, we are increasing our current dividend 
by 15% to further appeal to investors seeking yield. And as p
art of our 
updated program, we will access the debt markets. Peter will provide more 
details about all of this in a moment.
 
We appreciate the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us 
on how best to deploy our cash. We will review our cash al
location strategy 
each year, and we will continue to invest confidently in the business to bring 
great new products to market, strategically deploy capital in our supply 
chain, our retail stores and our infrastructure, and make acquisitions to 
expand our c
apabilities. We will be disciplined in what we do, but we will not 
underinvest.

Revenue for the quarter was $43.6 billion compared to $39.2 billion i
n the 
year ago quarter, an increase of $4.4 billion or 11% and $600 million over 
the high end of our guidance range. The year

was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad and iTunes sales as well as 
continued strong revenue from
 
iPhone and Mac.
 
Operating margin was $12.6 billion, representing 28.8% of revenue. Net 
income was $9.5 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $10.09.

nes compared to 35.1 million in the year

ago quarter, an 
increase of over 2.3 million or 7%. We ended the quarter with about 11.6 
million total iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1 
million iPhones and we ended the quarter within o
ur target range of four to 
six weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
 
Based on research published earlier this month by comScore, iPhones 
garnered the number one spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the three

share, up from 35% in the 
previous survey period. And in Japan, IDC Japan announced that iPhone

calendar Q4 2012 in both handsets and smartphones. This is also the first

A recent study by Kantar measured 95% loyalty rate among iPhone owners, 
substantially higher than the comp
etition, and iPhone remains top in 
customer experience. Last month, we were very pleased to receive the 
number one ranking in smartphone customer satisfaction from J.D. Power 
and Associates for the ninth consecutive time.
 
Businesses around the world contin

workforces. Globally, nearly 30,000 companies are developing and 
distributing iOS apps for corporate use by their employees.

Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 19.5 million iPads 
during the quarter 

million units or 65%.
 
iPad experienced very strong year
-
over
-
year growth in every operating 
segment, particularly in Greater China and Japan where sales more tha
n 
doubled year over year. Both iPad and iPad mini continue to be extremely 
popular, and we were pleased with sales of both.
 
We were able to sell significantly more iPad minis in the March quarter than 
in the December launch quarter and to expand availabili
ty to China. 
Customers love the combination of experience, performance, and size that 
iPad mini offers, and our early market research indicates that the 
overwhelming majority of iPad mini purchasers are first
-
time iPad 
customers.
 
We ended the quarter with 
about 4.8 million iPads in channel inventory, a 
sequential increase of about 1.4 million. All of the sequential increase was 
attributable to iPad mini. As we discussed previously, we were not able to 
meet demand for iPad mini in the December quarter and en
tered the March 
quarter below our target range of channel inventory. This sequential 
increase places us within our target range of four to six weeks of total iPad 
channel inventory.
 
The most recent survey published by ChangeWave indicated a 96% 
satisfactio
n rate among iPad customers. Not only is iPad a huge hit among 
consumers, but it also continues to be widely adopted by business customers 
as well. iPad and the iOS ecosystem are driving innovation across industries 
and in companies large and small.
 
We are
 
delighted by the number of companies that are choosing iPad for 
their most important business tasks as well as the rapid adoption of iPad in 
emerging countries around the world. Doctors at the Columbia 
Cardiovascular Foundation in South America are using 
an in
-
house app to 
perform remote diagnostics for patients in inaccessible parts of the country.
 
First National Bank, the oldest bank in South Africa has issued iPads to 
wealth managers to help enhance customer relationships and interactions. 
And in the ed

America. UNO Internacionalhas deployed more than 60,000
 
iPads to schools 
in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil including 17,000 iPads for teachers and 
students in Brazil in the March quarter alone.
 
Turning to Mac, we sold just under 4 million Macs, which is a 2% decline 
from the year
-
ago quarter. IDC estimates that 
the global personal computer 
market contracted by 14% during the March quarter. We experienced strong 
year

launch of our stunning new iMacs, offset by a decline in portable sales given 
a weak
er personal computer market overall. We ended the quarter within 
our four to five

Moving to iPod, we sold 5.6 million iPods compared to 7.7 million in the year 
ago quarter. iPod Touch continued to account for ove

important driver of our incredibly strong customer satisfaction and retention, 
as well as developer interest and success. This Sunday marks th
e 10th 
anniversary of the introduction of the iTunes Music Store, which 
revolutionized the distribution of digital content.
 
Today, our iTunes store offer the broadest combination of geographic reach 
in content depth in the industry, and they surpassed quar
terly billings of $4 

run rate making our digital content stores the largest in the world. The 

$2.4 
billion, up 28% from the year ago March quarter with new quarterly 
revenue records for music, movies, and apps.
 
The strong iTunes sales in addition to other service revenue helped us 
achieve for the first time more than $4 billion in combined quarterly rev
enue 
from iTunes, software, and services. We are thrilled with the growth of these 
revenue streams. Today, we have music stores in 119 countries offering a 
combined catalog of 35 million songs. We sell movies in 109 countries 
offering 60,000 titles, and we
 
have iBookstores in 155 countries offering 
1.75 million iBooks for sale, and with App Stores in 155 countries that 

created more than 850,000 iOS apps, including 350,000 apps made for iPad
.
 
Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 45 billion and app developers 
have made over $9 billion for their sales through the App Store, including 
$4.5 billion in the most recent four quarters alone. Canalys estimate the 
sales from our App Store accounted 
for 74% of all app sales worldwide in 
the March quarter. We believe this is in large part due to the great 
development environment, broad distribution, large and active user base, 
and seamless integration that the iOS platform offers.
 
Developer such as Bac
kflip Studios have seen explosive growth in their 
business, thanks to the success of their apps on the iOS platform. With 70 
people, this company maintains a growing suite of titles that has seen over 
275 million downloads equating to nearly 5 million dail
y active users and 34 
million monthly active users. With annual App Store sales approaching $100 

revenues in 2012.
 
Another tremendous success story is Supercell, founded in 2010. Ba
sed in 

have been the top most in iPad games in over 60 countries helping the 
company generate $8.5 million in revenue per employee in 2012. And in the 
enterprise, iOS devices have
 
a strong lead over Android. In its most recently 
published quarterly enterprise device activations report, Good Technologies 
found iOS devices accounted for 77% of all activations by its corporate 
customers.
 
And thanks to careful App Store curation for th
e quality of apps, the iOS 
platform offers a much more secure environment. Recent research by 
McAfee Labs found that 97% of identified mobile malware was on the 
Android platform, with the remainder primarily on the Symbian and Java ME 
platforms. But perhap
s the most important measure of the success of our 
ecosystem is how engaged our customers are with our products and 
services.
 
In its most recently published update, Chitika
 
found that iPad accounted for 
82% of all North American Tablet Web Traffic in March
. Interest in apps 
remained very strong in the March quarter with over 800 apps downloaded 
per second and year
-
over
-
year iOS app revenues more than doubling in the 
quarter. And since launching iCloud just 18 months ago, we now have 300 
million people using
 
it every day. We will continue to invest in the ecosystem 
and have some great new features and capabilities in the pipeline.
 

$5.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the year ago
 
quarter, an increase of 
19%. This growth was fueled primarily by strong sales of iPhone and iPad. 
We ended the quarter with a total of 402 stores, including a 151 outside the 
United States. We expect to open about 30 new stores in total in fiscal 2013 
and
 
to complete at least 20 store remodels. With an average of 401 stores 
open in the March quarter, average revenue per store was $13.1 million, 
compared to $12.2 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income 
was $1.1 billion.
 
We hosted 91 million v
isitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 
85 million in the year
-
ago quarter. That translates the 17,500 visitors per 
store per week. Total company gross margin was 37.5%, which was at the 
low end of our guidance range of 37.5% to 38.5%. Operati
ng expenses were 
$3.8 billion and included $488 million in stock based compensation expense. 
OI&E was $347 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%
 
And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $144.7 billion in cash 
plus short
-
term and long
-
t
erm marketable securities compared to $137.1 
billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $7.6 
billion. Over $102 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the 
March quarter, and cash flow from operations was $12.5 billio
n. We paid 
$2.5 billion in dividends in the March quarter, and earlier this month, we 
concluded the $1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we 
initiated in the December quarter, resulting in cumulative
 
retirement of over 
4 million shares of
 
Apple stock.
 
As Tim discussed, we are pleased to announce that we are more than 
doubling our return of capital program to $100 billion by the end of calendar 
year 2015, which translates to an average of about $30 billion per year. We 
will continue to retu
rn capital to shareholders through dividends, share 
repurchases, and cash used to net
-
share
-
settle vesting RSUs. To facilitate 
our program, we will access the debt markets.
 
Let me provide more details regarding the three key elements of our plan. 
First, ou
r Board has increased the share buyback authorization to $60 billion 

increase. This is the largest share buyback authorization of any company in 
history. We are very confident in Apple

repurchasing our shares represents an attractive use of our capital that we 
have dedicated a vast majority of the increase in our capital return program 
to share repurchases. We will buy shares under this authorizatio
n beginning 
this month. We will also continue to net
-
share
-
settle employee RSUs as they 
vest, and expect to use about $1 billion of cash annually to do this.
 
Second, we are increasing our quarterly dividend from $2.65 to $3.05 per 
share, a 15% 
increase. We plan to review our quarterly dividend payment 
annually. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per 
common share payable on May 16, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the 
close of business on May 13, 2013. We are very proud 
that Apple is among 
the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 
billion.
 
Third, we will access the U.S. debt markets over time and have recently 

signi
ficant cash offshore and repatriating this cash would result in significant 
tax consequences under current U.S. tax law.
 
Incorporating debt into our capital structure will provide several benefits 
including access to attractively priced capital, a reductio
n in our overall cost 
of capital and an efficient leverage of our very strong balance sheet. We 
expect to fund the capital return program from existing domestic cash, 
future cash generated in the U.S., and from borrowing in the U.S. We will 
maintain suffic
ient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute 
capital expenditures and acquisitions. The program announced today will 
result in returning an average of $30 billion annually to shareholders.
 
To put this in perspective, the $30 billion would have 
represented 
substantially all of our fiscal year 2012 fully tax free cash flow had we 
repatriated our foreign earnings. Between now and the end of calendar year 
2015, we would expect both our foreign cash and our domestic borrowing to 
grow. We will continu
e to review each element of our capital return program 
on an annual basis.
 
In conclusion, our capital return program is designed to facilitate our 
objective of delivering attractive returns to our shareholders on an efficient 
basis, while maintaining the f
lexibility to invest in the incredible 
opportunities that we continue to see for our business.
 

which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at th
e beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $33.5 
billion and $35.5 billion compared to $35 billion in the year
-
ago quarter. We 
expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting approximately 
$90 billion related to stock

ion expense. We expect OpEx to 
be between $3.85 billion and $3.95 billion including about $500 million 
related to stock
-
based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $300 
million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.
 
In closing, we are pleased with 
our record March quarter revenue and record 

depth of our tremendous ecosystem and our new all
-
time record for iTunes 
sales. We are also in the fortunate position to be able to more th
an double 
our return of capital program to $100 billion with the larger share 
repurchase authorization in history and to be one of the largest dividend 
payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion. We remain 
very confident in our product p
ipeline.

Sure. In the March quarter, our gross margin was 37.5%. It was at t
he low 
end of our range. We had a few items that on balance resulted in us 
reporting at the low end. They included mix, in particular, selling more iPads 
than we had planned, including getting iPad mini into our four

channel inventory range, s
ome changes in our service policies that required 
us to make provisions for prior quarter sales, and we had some unfavorable 

margin to be down between 50 basis points and 150 basis poi
nts 
sequentially. We see two factors impacting gross margin sequentially. First 
and the largest of the two is the loss of leverage on sequentially lower 
revenue; and second, a different product mix. We expect both of these 
headwinds to be partially offset 
by better cost in the quarter.

Okay. Thank you, and Tim, question for you on China. Growth did slow in 
that market to single digits this quarter, curious of your perspective as to 
whether Apple is hitting a wall give

Tim Cook
 
Katy, thanks for the question. We actually had our best quarter ever in 
Greater China. So it was a record for us. The revenue came in at $8.8 billion. 
That includes our retail stores that are in that region that is up 11% year on 
year, again 
that includes the retail stores that are in that region, which is the 
same as Apple is growing.
 
The highlights for the quarter in China were that iPads grew 138% year

during the quar

Okay, thanks. Tim, you mentioned several factors that were compressing 
growth in gross margins in recent quarters in this year. but can you 
comment a bit more on the competitive landscape in 2013 
versus 2012? how 
has it surprised you, and what do you think the company needs to do to 
reinvigorate your share gains across your key product categories?
 
Tim Cook
 
Bill, I think the smartphone market has always been competitive. The names 
have been changed.
 
the names of competitors have changed. In the 
beginning, RIM was sort of the very strongest player, because the 
smartphone as you know really got going into the enterprise area. And of 
course, today, our tough competitor from a hardware point of view woul
d be 
Samsung and married to Google on the operating system side.
 
They are obviously tough competitors, but we feel that we have the best 
products by far. And we are continuing to invest in innovative products and 
feel really, really confident about our pro
duct pipeline in both hardware, 
software and also our services. We have the best ecosystem by far, and

Thank you very much. Tim, you alluded to fall announcements of products, 
is that indicating that there may not be substantial new products until

I have incredible confidence. We exited the March qu
arter with no shortages 
while achieving inventory turns of over 90, which is still to this day is 

was the largest quarter ever in the history of Apple and the technology 
industry as
 
a whole. And as you know, it included for us a number of new 
products and unprecedented number and of new product ramps. The reality 
is the work we do to produce truly innovative products is very hard and

However, I would assure you that we are working very closely with our

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit the gross margin question. and 

experiencing that
 
the normal kinds of experience curves or declining cost 
curves that you do in typical product ramps. And whether you could 
comment on the sequential decline in iPhone ASPs, which were down nearly 
$30 sequentially, I presume that reflects a mix of 4 and 4S
 
relative to the 5. 
But perhaps, you can confirm that in what its impact might have on gross 
margins and how we should think about that? and I have a follow

up please.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

ith the 

partially offset the loss of leverage and the different product mix that we 
expect to see in the June quarter and we have factored these cost 
improvements into the guidanc

ASPs were down sequentially about $28 as you noted. And this was driven 
primarily by mix. The largest factors were an increase in the iPhone 4 mix, 
which resulted from or making the iPhone 4 more affordable in 
many 
markets. And also mix within the iPhone 5 as it was in its second full 
quarter.
 
Toni M. Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
And its impact on margins, how do we think about relative margins for 4 
relative to 5 on balance?

products.
 
Toni M. Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & C
o. LLC
 
Okay. Thank you. Tim, I wanted to follow
-
up with you on a statement you 
made in a previous response. You talked earlier about how you are excited 
about the large addressable markets that you have particularly, the 
smartphone and tablet marketplaces.
 
And you talked about how strongly 
and confidently, you feel about competitive advantages in your products and 
ecosystems. If I step back and look at the data for this quarter on the phone 
side, if I adjust for inventory, the iPhone was up very low to mid 
single 
digits. I think most third
-
party market data would say that the smartphone 
market probably grew about 30%. And if I look broadly incorporating your 
guidance for next quarter and thinking about fiscal Q1, it appears very 
unlikely that Apple will grow
 
at that market rate of 30% or more. So I am 
wondering if you could comment on a) whether that [extent of the] [ph] loss 
in market share is something that is 

 
Apple has focused on or cares about 
as a principle financial objective? And if so, why do you th
ink there is this 
disconnect between the very attractive products that you are offering and 
the market data that I just cited?
 
Tim Cook
 
So, Toni, let me try to address, you mentioned both smartphones and 
tablets and so let me try to address both of those. 
First let me start with the 

believe the market in March declined by 30% from December, December 
being obviously seasonally high quarter with a holiday. As you can see from 
our numbe
rs, we declined 15%. And so if that holds, we did much better 
than the market and had a very nice pick up in market share.
 
And, obviously, on iPad, we continue to have an ecosystem story that is 
unparalleled, we have 350,000 apps that are optimized for iPa
d versus a few 
hundred for our competition and the overall experience in the fit and finish 
of the product, I think, we agree is substantially better than the options 
there.
 
On the phone side, the numbers that you talked about, the sell
-
in 
comparisons year
-
over 

year, you really have to convert that to sell
-
through 

grow channel inventory in the year ago quarter because we were catching 
up on the roll out of the iPhone 4S, in fact, we 
grew by 2.6 million. And so 
you have to factor in to get at the real sell
-
through.
 
However, I take your point if the market did grow by 30%, we still, after 
that normalization, we grew less than that. And so I think the question or 
the 

 
this point is not 

however, as the only measure of our health. The things that are very 
important to us in addition to market share and unit volumes include things 
like customer stat, which were the highest by far winning
 

times consecutively and the customer loyalty and repurchase rates, which 
were the highest by far the 95% according to Kantar. And the ecosystem 
commerce, which attracts developers is incredible, Canalys says that we 
have 74%, so basicall
y $3 out of $4 that are spent on apps are spent in our 
ecosystem.
 
And if you then looked at usage statistics, they are staggering at the usage 
of iOS versus other operating systems. And so market shares are important 
and unit volumes are important, but the
se other things for us are extremely 
important, because we are all about customer experience and enriching 
lives.
 
Now, that said, we see an enormous number of first time smartphone buyers 
coming to market, particularly, in certain countries around the worl
d. And so 

iPhone 4 even more affordable and which has made it more attractive to first 
time buyers and we caught up on the 

 
our supply 
-
 
demand towards the 
late in the quarter last
 
quarter and we are continuing to do that in other 
markets. And we believe that the phone or the price point that we are 
offering is an incredible value for people, that allows them to get into the 
ecosystem with a really, really, phenomenal product.

Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Tim and Peter, can you comment on gross 
margin beyond next quarter maybe what does 
it say about long
-
term gross 
margins if 36 to 37 is the margin that you are calling for when your highest 

implying that when you say all these new products are coming in the fall.
 
So is there an implied margin philosophy here with this 2Q guide that 36 is 
as low as you wanted to get and then maybe it gets better from there or is 
there nothing that we should imply in terms of how the company views gross 
margins?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Be

-

not providing specific gross margin guidance beyond the June quarter. We 

margins and a specific quarter an
d cause them to vary widely over time, 
including product cycles, commodity markets, product mix, and currencies.
 

we think about gross margin and hopefully this will help. We are man
aging 
the business for the long
-
term and are willing to trade off short
-
term profit 
where we see long
-
term potential. The iPod is a great example of this. When 
we launched it in 2001, its margins were significantly below the margins of 
Apple at that time.
 
Four years later, the iPod and the iTunes Music Store comprised half of 

another great example. We have priced it aggressively and its margins are 
significantly below the corporate avera
ge. However, we believe deeply in the 
long
-



 
We b
elieve deeply that there are people in every part of the world that want 

good business decisions balancing units, revenues, and the bottom line. We 
think about all three and as I sai

-
term trade
-
offs and profits, where we see long
-
term potential.
 

-
term horizon. Some of our 
revenues and profits occur after we ship our products. We were thrilled to 
exceed this quarter
 
$4 billion in revenue for our services for the first time. 
And as Tim mentioned, we will augment our very strong ecosystem with new 
services and make the current ones even, even better. So we remain very 
confident in our strategy and we will use our world
-
class skills in engineering 
and operations to manage our business well in the future.
 
Ben A. Reitzes 

 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
All right, thanks. And Tim, my follow
-
up just for you, just maybe asking you 
this every quarter in different ways. But I just wan
ted to get your reaction to 
what you thought of the 5
-
inch phone market at this time versus three 
months ago? And if anything has changed in your view as to that market 
and its place in the smartphone world versus your 4
-

it from me

the absolute best display in the industry. And we always strive to create the 
very best display for our customers. And some customers value large screen 
size, others val
ue also other factors such as resolution, color quality, white 
balance, brightness, reflectivity, screen longevity, power consumption, 
portability, compatibility with apps and many things.
 
Our competitors had made some significant trade
-
offs in many of the
se 
areas in order to ship a larger display, we would not ship a larger display 
iPhone while these trade
-
offs exist.
 
Ben A. Reitzes

Got it.

you.

Gene E. Munster 

 
Piper Jaffray, Inc.
 
Hey, good afternoon. Tim, I just 
wanted to confirm, did you mention in your 
prepared remarks that something about new product categories or did I not 
hear you correctly?
 
Tim Cook
 
I did, Gene. I said that one of our areas for growth are potential new 

t those.
 
Gene E. Munster 

 
Piper Jaffray, Inc.
 
And that would presumably be kind of in the next year?
 
Tim Cook
 

 
Gene E. Munster 

 
Piper Jaffray, Inc.
 
Okay. And Peter, you mentioned new services in that yo
u can kind of build 
and kind of improve on existing services, and I guess, beyond just the 
natural evolution of maybe Maps and iCloud, are there any other kind of key 
assets that you guys have which you can leverage in the new services?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
W
ell, nothing specific, Gene, but we are very fortunate to have the largest 
and broadest ecosystem in the world. We have App Stores in 155 countries 
and iTunes Stores in over 110 countries. We have hundreds of millions of 

lion run rate on the iTunes Stores in terms 
of billings, and just achieved for the first time $4 billion in revenue for our 


tremendously to delight 
our customers and continue to grow our business in those areas.
 
Tim Cook
 
And I would just add to that, because we are not fragmented like our 
competition, we can update an iOS
 
with a major release and a substantial 
percentage of our
 
customers will update to the 

 

made that very elegant and very easy. Also because the usage for iOS is so 
much higher, when we integrate things well, people use them a lot more and 
so just those concepts by itself are huge advan
tages from a customer 

about point of view.
 
Gene E. Munster 

 
Piper Jaffray, Inc.
 
Okay. Let met ask you this way in terms of just the payment
 
market 
specifically, I mean, do you fe
el that that market is well addressed today 
with the offerings out there?
 
Tim Cook
 

the starting block.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks, Gene

Shannon S. Cross 

 
Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about 

obviously you outperfo

down about 2%. So I am curious as to whether or not you think elasticity of 
demand with lower prices or what you are hearing from your customers in 
terms of their reluctance to buy a new Mac and then also 


 
Tim Cook
 
I think the, Shannon, I think the reason that we were down last quarter, we 
were down 2% as you had mentioned. The market for PCs are incredibly 
weak. IDC said 
that the market for the March quarter was down 14% year
-
on
-
year, which is the largest decline that I remember from being in this 
industry for a long time. At the same time, we sold almost 20 million iPads 

nnibalized some Macs. I 

think probably the larger thing at least for the, maybe not so much on the 

cy
cles.
 

means. I think it has a lot of life to it. We are going to continue to innovate 
in it. We believe that if anything the huge growth in tablets may wind up 
benefiting the Mac, b
ecause it pushes people to think about the product 


continue making the best personal computers. our strategy is 
not changing. 
And we feel really good about it. We delivered some incredible innovation 
last year with Retina display with the MacBook Pro, an incredible thin and 


o invest in.
 
Shannon S. Cross 

 
Cross Research LLC
 
Okay. And just a follow
-


about wins in the enterprise, and touting the 
benefits of Microsoft and some 


your customers, have you seen much displacement and what are sort of th
e 
discussions that you have with enterprise customers with regard to iPads 
and fitting into their systems? Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
We seem to be doing really well and Peter had referenced earlier, the Good 

 
all their 
activations by their corporate customers. Now that would not include 
BlackBerry, but it would include all the other guys. and so we seem to be 


ore and more people developing more and 

very, very bullish on it. As a matter of fact, just to quote you some numbers, 

n more 

 
Shannon S. Cross 

 
Cross Research LLC
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah.

Mark A. Moskowitz 

 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thank you. Tim, earlier you talked about how the December quarter had a 
very big and broad product refresh, were there any learning
 
points from that 

kind of stagger out 
launches over multi
-
quarters versus one quarter. How should we think about 
that going forward?
 
Tim Cook
 

from it, and if we could run it over frankly, I would
 
have announced the iMac 
after the turn of the year, because we felt
 
our customers had to wait too 
long for that specific product; or the iPad mini was in shortage in the 
December quarter I would not have done that differently, because we were 
able to get 
the iPad mini out to many millions of customers who really 
wanted that product for their holiday. And so, yes, we did do a lot, our 
teams fortunately can do a lot, but in retrospect that one, yeah, I sort of 
wish it were after the turn of the year, because
 
our customers would not 
have had to wait as long as they did.
 
Mark A. Moskowitz 

 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. And then my follow
-
up question is back to the ecosystem. Are there 
other metrics or milepost you can share with us, you acknowledged earlier 
th
at the growth of revenue at Apple have slowed for some of your key 
products. But how about the ecosystem in terms of usage rates, are you 

maybe acceleration within each user?
 
Tim Co
ok
 

by us, as a matter of fact the vast majority of them come from other people. 

phenomenal difference. And I think
 
that shows the strength of the 
ecosystem.

Peter Oppenheimer
 
Thank you, Nancy. We are pleased to report the results of our
 
third fiscal 
quarter. We established a new June quarter record for iPhone sales driving 

 
Revenue for the quarter was $35.3 billion, up $300 million or 1% from the 
year ago quarter, and at the high end of our gui
dance range. Gross margin 
was 36.9% also at the high end of our guidance range, and operating 
margin was $9.2 billion representing 26% of revenue. Net income was $6.9 
billion translating to the diluted earnings per share of $7.47. Channel 
inventories decli
ned sequentially by $1 billion during the June quarter this 
year meaning that sell
-
through was $36.3 billion. In contrast, channel 
inventory increased $700 million from the beginning to the end of the June 
quarter last year meaning that sell
-
through was $3
4.3 billion in that quarter. 
As such, our June quarter sell
-
through increased by $2 billion, or 6% year
-
over
-
year ahead of our 1% [selling and] [ph] revenue growth.
 

million iPho
nes compared to 26 million in the year ago quarter, an increase 
of 5.2 million, or 20%. We had a sequential decrease of about 600,000 
iPhones in channel inventory in the June quarter translating to iPhone sell
-
through of about 31.8 million units. iPhone sa
les were ahead of our 
expectations and we were particularly pleased with very strong year
-
over
-
year growth in iPhone sales in a number of both developed and emerging 
markets including the U.S., UK, Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, Thailand and 
Singapore. iPho
ne 5 remains by far the most popular iPhone but we were 
also happy with sales of iPhone 4 and 4s. We exited the quarter with about 
11 million units of total iPhones in channel inventory and ended within our 
target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel in
ventory.
 
iPhone unit sales in the U.S. increased 51% compared to the year ago 
quarter and based on research recently published by comScore, iPhone once 
again achieved the number one spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the 
three months period ended in Ma
y with over 39% share. iPhone sales were 
also very strong in Japan growing [66%] [ph] year
-
over
-
year. iPhone is the 
top selling smartphone in Japan based on the latest published quarterly data 
from IDC and Apple is the number one or number two selling smar
tphone 
manufacturer in most markets IDC tracks including North America, Western 
Europe, Russia, Turkey, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and 
Singapore.
 
The most recently published study by Kantar measured at 93% loyalty rate 
among iPhone owners sig
nificantly higher than our competitors. And iPhone 
continues to lead in terms of customer experience. Not only has iPhone 
earned the top spot in customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates, 
an unprecedented nine consecutive times it has also recei
ved the top 
customer satisfaction ranking in a number of surveys including the recent 
Quality Insights survey of smartphone customers in South Korea. iPhone 
also continues to be the smartphone of choice for business. Given the 
security and stability of iOS
, enterprise and government customers around 
the world continue to deploy iPhone on their network in ways that go far 
beyond personal productivity.
 
Companies have built tens of thousands of custom apps to improve every 
aspect of their business. Global comp
anies including American Airlines, 
Cisco, General Electric, Roche and SAP have deployed more than 25,000 
iPhones each across their organizations. U.S. government organizations such 

Administrat
ion, the ATF and the National Geospatial
-
Intelligence Agency are 
supporting and managing thousands of iPhones on their networks and 
continue to create both customer facing and internal iOS apps.
 
And just this past quarter iOS 6 was granted FIPS 140
-
2 valid
ation by the 
U.S. federal government and approval by the U.S. Department of Defense to 
connect to their networks. Combining sales to business, government and 
education customers, iPhone holds a 62.5% share of the U.S. commercial 
market based on the latest 
quarterly data published by IDC.
 
Turning to iPad we sold 14.6 million iPads during the quarter compared to 17 
million in the year ago quarter. The tough year
-
over
-
year comparison was 
driven by both the significant channel inventory increase and the first f
ull 
quarter of the availability of the third generation iPad in the year ago 
quarter. We built 1.2 million units of iPad channel inventory in the June 
quarter last year whereas we reduced channel inventory by 700,000 units in 
the June quarter this year.
 
Fa
ctoring in this 1.9 million unit channel inventory swing, iPad unit sell
-
through was down 3% year
-
over
-
year. We exited the quarter with about 4.1 
million units of iPad channel inventory within our target range of 4 to 6 
weeks.
 
Customers continue to love th
eir iPads, for the second consecutive time in 
the two year history of a survey, iPad ranked number one in the 2013 U.S. 
tablet satisfaction survey by J.D. Power and Associates and again in its latest 
study published today [Chitika] [ph] reported that iPad 
accounted for 84.3% 
share of tablet web usage by customers in the U.S. and Canada, its highest 
level this year.
 
In every major industry around the world companies are developing, 
deploying and supporting apps for iPad. Government organizations as well as 
g
lobal enterprise companies across diverse fields including automotive, 
insurance, energy services and healthcare are using iPad and custom apps to 
create unique meaningful experiences for their employees, partners, and 

ltural Statistics Service has deployed 
thousands of iPads to in
-
person interviewers resulting in higher response 
rates and decreased cost. And companies including Eli Lilly, Novartis, Cathay 
Life, Roche, and SAP have deployed over 20,000 iPads each across 
their 
organizations.
 
Turning to Mac, we are pleased with sales of 3.8 million Macs, which is a 7% 
decline from the year ago quarter, but higher than our expectations. IDC 
estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 11% 
during the June 
quarter, indicating that Macs gained share. In June, we 
introduced two new versions of MacBook Air and customer response has 
been great. Wired magazine described the new 13
-
inch MacBook Air as 
nearly flawless citing its phenomenal battery life, processing 
performance, 
feather
-
light chassis, and super
-
fast WiFi. Additionally, last month, we 
provided a sneak
-
peek at our next generation Mac Pro engineered around 
the workstation graphics with dual GPUs, PCI Express
-
based flash storage, 
high
-
performance Thunderb
olt 2, next generation Xeon processors, ultra
-
fast 
memory and support for 4
-
K video. The new state
-
of
-
the
-
art Mac Pro will be 
assembled in the U.S. and will be available later this year.
 
We were excited to release to developer preview of OS X Mavericks las
t 
month. More than 200 new features, OS 
-
 
with more than 200 new features, 
OS X Mavericks brings Maps and iBooks to the Mac, introduces Finder Tags 
and Tabs, enhances multi
-
display support for power users, delivers new core 
technologies for breakthrough po
wer efficiency and performance, and 
includes an all
-
new version of Safari. OS X Mavericks will be available to 
customers in the fall. We ended the quarter with just below our 4 to 5 week 
target range of Mac channel inventory.
 
Our U.S. education institution
 
business had a great quarter generating its 
highest quarterly revenue ever. The results were fueled by all
-
time record 
quarterly iPad sales of 1.1 million units in addition to strong June quarter 

ive, which 

personal computing solutions allowed individual school districts to choose 
which products to purchase rather than standardized on a single statewide 
solution. We are v
ery proud that an estimated 94% of the 69,000 total units 
selected this year were Apple products. And we are extremely pleased to 

approval to begin the first phase of a massive rollout of 
iPads to students 
across the district starting this fall. The district is the second largest in the 
United States and plans to equip every one of its 660,000 students with a 
tablet by 2014.
 
We continue to be very pleased with the growth and the strength of
 
the 
Apple ecosystem. With the broadest geographic reach and depth of content 
in the industry, our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $4.3 billion in 
the June quarter culminating in our best months and best week ever for App 
Store billings at the v

translated to quarterly revenue of $2.4 billion, up 29% from the year ago 
quarter with strong growth in revenue in both content and apps. The 
continued strong iTunes sales combined with other software a
nd service 
revenue resulted in total quarterly revenue of $4 billion from iTunes software 
and services. We added some great new video content to iTunes and Apple 
TV.
 
Last month we announced HBO GO and WatchESPN are now available 
directly on Apple TV joinin

catalog, live sports from MLB, NBA and NHL as well as Internet content from 
Vimeo, YouTube and Flickr. Sky News, Crunchyroll and Qello are offering live 
news, sports and current TV programming. Apple TV use
rs can now choose 
from a broad selection of programming including over 60,000 movies and 

on the iTunes Store.
 
iTunes users have downloaded more than 1 billion TV episodes and 390 
m
illion movies from iTunes to
-
date, and they are purchasing over 800,000 
TV episodes and over 350,000 movies per day. We recently celebrated the 
five year anniversary of our amazing app store. Our developers have now 
created more than 900,000 iOS apps inclu
ding 375,000 apps made for iPad. 
The popularity of these apps remains incredibly strong.
 
Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 50 billion and app developers 
have made over $11 billion for their sales through the App Store half of 
which was earned in the 
last four quarters. Our vibrant ecosystem continues 
to drive tremendous user engagement with our devices and services and we 
now have over 320 million iPod accounts and 240 million Game Center 
accounts and our customers have sent almost 900 billion iMessag
es, 
uploaded over a 125 billion photos and received over 8 trillion push 
notifications. And thanks to the stability and security and popularity of the 
iOS platform, the iOS devices continue to have a strong lead over Android in 
the enterprise.
 
In its most 
recently published quarterly enterprise device activations report, 
the technology is found that among its corporate clients iPhone 5 was by far 


ing to invest in software and services to 
make the ecosystem and user experience even richer. This fall we will 
release a beta version of iWork for iCloud bringing pages, numbers and 
keynotes to the web. With iWork for iCloud users will be able to create g
reat 
looking letters, reports and flyers, generate complex yet beautiful 
spreadsheets and develop and deliver beautiful presentations with powerful 
graphics and special effects all from within a web browser.
 

h of iOS 7 with its stunning 
new user interface and many great new features including control center, 
AirDrop and iTunes Radio, smarter multi
-
tasking and enhancements to 
notification center, photos, Safari and Siri.
 
I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue for the quarter 
was 4.1 billion approximately equal to the year ago quarter. The stores 
experienced strong growth in iPhone sales and have been most successful 
MacBook Air launch to
-
date.
 
We open
ed six new stores across five countries during the quarter and end 
of the quarter with a total of 408 stores including a 156 outside of United 
States. We expect over nine new stores in the September quarter getting us 
to a total of 27 new store openings in
 
fiscal 13. We also relocated four stores 
in the June quarter that had outgrown their former space and we expect to 

405 stores opened in the June average revenue per store was 10.1
 
million 
compared to 11.1 million in the year ago quarter.
 
Retail segment income was 667 million; we hosted 84 million visitors to our 
stores during the quarter this translates to 16,000 visitors per store per 
week. Operating expenses were 3.8 billion and 
included 488 million in stock 
based compensation expense. OI&E was 234 million and the tax rate for the 
quarter was 26.9%. And turning to our cash we ended the quarter with a 
146.6 billion in cash plus short term and long term marketable securities 
compare
d to a 144.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential 
increase of 1.9 billion. A 106 billion of our total cash was offshored at the 
end of the June quarter and cash flow from operations with 7.8 billion. In 
early April we concluded the 1.95 bi
llion accelerated share repurchase 
program that we initiated in December quarter resulted in cumulative 
retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock under that program.
 
In late April we executed a very successful debt offering issuing 17 billion of 
d
ebt across 3, 5, 10 and 30 year maturities. We paid 2.8 billion in dividends 
in the quarter and we also utilized a total of 16 billion in cash on share 
repurchase activity through a combination of a new accelerated share 
repurchase program and open market 
purchases. 12 billion of the 16 billion 
was utilized under a new ASR program initiated with two financial 
institutions in April.
 
An initial delivery of 23.5 million shares was made under this program with 
the final number of shares delivered in average pri
ce per share to be 
determined at the conclusion of the program, based on the volume weighted 


open marke
t share repurchases, resulting in the retirement of 9 million 
additional shares. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 
per common share payable on August 15, 2013, the shareholders of record 
as of the close of business on August 12, 2013.
 
Now, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I would like to review our 
outlook, which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$34 billion and $37 billion comp
ared to $36 billion in the year ago quarter. 
We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting 
approximately $90 billion related to stock
-
based compensation expense. We 
expect OpEx to be between $3.9 billion and $3.95 billion, including about 
$49
5 million related to stock
-
based compensation. We expect OI&E to be 
about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.
 
In closing, we are pleased with our record June quarter iPhone sales, the 
strong growth in revenue from iTunes software and
 
services, and the 
continued enhancement and popularity of our tremendously vibrant 
ecosystem. We are very excited about the upcoming releases of the stunning 
new iOS 7 in OS X Mavericks, and we are very hard at work on some 
amazing new products that we wi
ll introduce in the fall in across 2014.
 

 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and 
one follow
-
up. Operator, may we have the first question please?
 
Question
-
a
nd
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with 
Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Yes, thanks. Peter, as you mentioned in the press release today, new 
products will ship this fall, and his
torically, gross margins do come down in a 

you talk about why this product cycle might be different?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Katy, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect our gross 
margins to be 
between 36% and 37%, which is consistent with what we expected in the 
June quarter. And on a sequential basis, that would mean that gross margin 
would be largely flat to slightly down. We are on track to have a very busy 
fall. I would like to
 
leave it there and go into more detail on October.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. As a follow
-
up, can you talk about of why you think channel inventory 
came down more than seasonally this quarter and also inventory on your 
balance sheet was up signif
icantly, is that a direct result of the channel 
wanting to hold back inventory?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Katy, I will take the balance sheet part of your question and Tim can talk 
about the channel.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
The invent
ory on the balance sheet was really up for two reasons. First, we 
have got more storage this year than we had last. So, our finished goods 
inventory was a part of the inventory increase and then our components 
inventory was up as well.
 
Tim Cook
 

Tim. From an iPad point of view, or iPad and iPhone, we reduced 
inventory, and reduced it fairly significantly. iPad was down over 700,000 
units in the beginning of the quarter and iPhone was down over 600. As you 
know from working with us over several qua

have any more inventory than we need. And so if we can find a way to 
reduce, we do so. And we have done that in both of these cases. We also 
have slight decreases in the Macintosh area and on iPod.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan St
anley
 
Okay, thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
From Goldman Sachs, we will go to Bill Shope.
 
Bill Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay, great. Thanks. I have a bit of a longer term question. Despite the 
fairly substantial iPhone upside this quarter, there has been increasing 
concerns at the high
-
end of the smartphone markets reaching a saturation 
point and that growth may be harder t
o come by for really for all vendors. 

Tim, do you think there are new innovations and services in the pipeline that 

usly 
been a bit tough 2013 to that segment, to the industry.
 
Tim Cook
 
Well from a growth point of view for Apple our key catalysts will be, always 
will be new products and new services and these are above in existing 

egories. In addition to this we have 
opportunities and distribution from carrier relationships to expanding our 
retail stores, expanding our online store and continuing to expand the 
indirect channel and we also have a market expansion opportunity, Peter 
m
entioned enterprise in his comments and the share positions that we have 

end of that and so I think we have lots of growth opportunities.
 
And I don't subscribe to the common view th
at the higher end if you will of 

and we will report our result as we go along.
 
Bill Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay, great. And then on the iPad side of the equation. Looking at sell 
thr
ough decline this quarter obviously ex the channel inventory dynamics, 
should we think of this as more of a pause within your customer base ahead 
of your next refresh as we see in the past or is there a broader industry 
dynamic at play within tablets that 
could contribute to that.
 
Tim Cook
 
For us if you look year
-
over
-
year. We had 2.4 million unit decline but 80% of 
that or 1.9 million units were just due to changes in channel inventory. As I 
think Peter referenced earlier, we reduced by over 700 in the cur
rent quarter 
and the year ago quarter had an increase of 1.2 and so the underlying sell 

year ago quarter we had just announced the third
-
generation iPad which was 
our first iPad
 
with a retina display. We had announced in March and so that 
was our first full quarter and so from what Peter and I expected 90 days ago 
we hit within the midpoint of the range that we expected to hit on iPad unit 
sales and so it was not a surprise to us
.
 
In terms of how other people are doing, I don't know. What I can tell you is 
that most recent data I have gotten which actually just came out I believe 
this morning is that the iPad Web share data shows that through the quarter 
we accelerated further and
 
are now, iPad accounts for 84% of the web traffic 
from tablets which is absolutely incredible and so if there are lots of other 

pretty, the basic function is web browser.
 
We feel r
eally good about where we are. Peter had mentioned earlier we had 

really happy to be selected for the first phase of 660,000 unit roll out at LA 
Unified and really bold move they 
are making to change teaching and 
learning and we had double
-
digit unit growth in China, for iPad in Japan, in 
Canada, in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East and in India and so 

 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Bill. Can we
 
have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
From Sanford Bernstein, we will go to Toni Sacconaghi.
 
Antonio Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein
 
I was wondering if you could provide some kind of gross margin bridge 
sequentially, I think last quarter you had about
 
a 90 basis point one time 
impact from the China warranty accrual. So if we adjust for that gross 
margins were down about a 150 basis points sequentially, and the mix of 

the expe
rience curve in these products, I was surprised given the mix that 
gross margins were as down as much sequentially as they were. Can you 
provide a bridge on a sequential basis on what happened with gross 
margins?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. First of all, let m
e say, we are very pleased with gross margin in the 
quarter at 36.9%. It was at really the high end of the range that we 
provided of 36% to 37%. And the sequential decline was not a surprise to 
us. We understood the warranty effects in March. And as I said
 
on last 

for two reasons. The first is the lower sequential revenue, so we lost 
leverage going from March to June, and we expected a different product 
mix. And as you can see, we 
reported very near the top end of that and feel 
good.
 
Antonio Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein
 
Right, but Peter, the mix ultimately was not that different I think iPhones 
were 52.5% last quarter, they were 51.5%. So, it actually seems like your 
mix was pe
rhaps better than you had anticipated. So, I appreciate the 
volume revenue mix, but was your mix exactly in line with what you 
expected?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Well we had some puts and takes within the quarter, but it was 

 
it 
ultimately ended up within the ra
nge that we thought it would be and we hit 
the high end.
 
Antonio Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein
 
Okay. The second one I was wondering whether you could comment on was 
just iPhone ASPs, they were down about 5% sequentially or down about 
10% over the 



geographies versus others?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
We wer
e down 4% year
-
over
-
year on the iPhone ASP about $27, and that 
was primarily due to the mix of the products that we are selling and FX 
headwinds. As we anticipated iPhone 4 sales accelerated as we offered more 
affordable pricing in emerging and other marke

-
over
-
year basis. And then sequentially, it was down about $32, and again, that 
was driven by mix as well in part iPhone 4. Tim, do you want make 
comments about what we may have seen in the regions?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes, sure. From an iPhone
 
point of view, Toni, with the moves that we made 
on 4 and with iPhone 5 continuing to be the most popular model we saw 
very strong sales in several of the emerging markets or prepaid markets. 
India was up over 400%. Turkey and Poland were both up over 60%
. The 
Philippines were up about 140%. And in addition, we saw very strong iPhone 
sales in several of the developed markets. For example, the U.S. was up 
over 50%, Japan up over 60%, the UK about 50%, and so we had several 
regions, where iPhone growth actua
lly accelerated from the previous 
quarter, which is a unusual pattern for us and we were very, very happy 
with this.

And notably absent from that list was China, was that was your pricing how 
you treated to change 
pricing this quarter relative to previous quarters any 
different in China than the rest of the world?
 
Tim Cook
 
China was weaker in the quarter, although the datasheet that obviously 

k at 
sell
-

important to do that. And so our sell
-
through in China was only down 4% 
from the year ago quarter when you normalized for channel inventory. Hong 
Kong was actually down more si
gnificantly. Mainland China was actually up 
year
-
over
-
year. It was up 5%, but that is the lower growth rate than we 
have been seeing and are attributed to many things including the economy 

g is an 
international shopping haven as you know for not only tourist but also some 
resellers and we saw more dramatic downturn there, it's not totally clear 
exactly what had occurred but it was down on a sell through basis by about 
20% so that weighed gre
ater China down as you can see in your data sheet.

The question that I wanted ask was with regard to, there's been a lot o
f talk 
about a trade
-
in program that you guys are going to start even doing on 

something that could help margins and help expand your emerging market 
sales and how is that going 
to work? Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
Ben we haven't announced anything relative to a trade
-
in program
 
so what 

trade
-
in programs now not only in the U.S. but in different regions and the 
reason that
 
it's so attractive around iPhone is that the residual value of an 
iPhone stay so high and there is so much demand for it and so that makes 
the trade
-
in programs more lucrative to a win
-
win from many points of view. 
But we haven't announced anything about 
us.
 
Ben Reitzes

Barclays Capital
 
Are you opposed to it?
 
Tim Cook
 

aspect of it and so that part of it really is encouraging today.
 
Ben Reitzes

Okay, then rea
lly quick on China you answered some of it in the question 
before but how do we turn it around here, China and other APAC, what can 
we do to make it turn, you know there has been some press in China that 
obviously you had to deal with and when do we see th
at market turning and 
even though investors are worried about it from a secular point of view as 
well as the economy there.
 
Tim Cook
 
I think it's important to put in perspective. If you combine the stores (ph) 
that we have in Greater China our revenues the
re were 4.9 billion for the 
quarter and so that 14% powered the company which is very significant and 
in a few years that was in 100s of millions and so we have run our business 
there significantly.
 
We have a very strong market there and in the last 12 mon
ths we have 
done 27 billion on a trailing basis and so it's a huge business for us. 
Underlying the results are, if you look at iPad sell through in greater China 
was up 8% but the sell through in Mainland China was up 37% and so iPad 
is doing remarkably we
ll. The latest share numbers we have seen on iPad for 
the tablet market is over 50% and year
-
to
-
date iPad units are up 48% year
-
over
-
year and so there have been direct growth there.
 
From an ecosystem point of view we continue to attract a lot of developers
 
from China. We now have about a 0.5 million developers in China that are 

-
over
-
year and so I 

offered their apps through, in differ





sales both of which are currently lower than where we would them or need 

with great quality. And so I continu
e to believe that in the arc of time here, 

-
day cycle that can have economic factors and other things in it.

From Piper Jaffray, we will hear from Gene Munster.
 
Gene Munster

Piper Jaffray
 
Good afternoon. You talked about more affordable pricing and Peter, can you 
just confirm that, that was just with the 
iPhone 4 and then separately as you 
think about the growth that you had in some of these emerging markets, it 
sounds like some more recently it has come from affordable pricing, but also 
you potentially could address those markets in products that are more
 
appropriate for those markets? And maybe can you just talk from a very 
high level just how you think about, are those both levers that you 
potentially could use or do you feel that pricing is the lever? And then a 
follow
-
up question.
 
Tim Cook
 

im. The reference that Peter made earlier was to the iPhone 4 
and what we have seen is that the number of first
-
time smartphone buyers 
that the iPhone 4 is attracting is very, very impressive. And we want to 
attract as many of these buyers as we can. And w
e saw that beginning to 
happen towards the end of the Q2 timeframe as I have referenced on last 

affordable pricing on a wider scale basis this quarter and continued to be 
very happy wi
th what we saw and where iPhone 5 continues to be the most 
popular iPhone by far, we are really happy to provide an incredible high
-
quality product with iPhone 4 running iOS 6 to as many first
-
time 

 
exactly a great 
product for that buyer.
 
Gene Munster

Piper Jaffray
 
Do you think there are more weapons that you could use in these markets to 
continue the pace that you have?
 
Tim Cook
 
There is always more weapons. And we have more than one tool in the 
t

and the customer set ratings that we have with iOS 6 and the stickiness of 

offer it.
 
Gene Munster

Pi
per Jaffray
 
Okay. And then my final question is just in terms of the growth question that 
some investors have about how you keep such a higher revenue growth 
number moving, last quarter you referred to new products emerging and this 
time you referred to mo
re products over the next few years. Are there 
product categories out there that are big enough to move the needle for 
Apple?
 
Tim Cook
 
We will see, Gene. We are working on some stuff that we are really proud of 
and we will see how it does, and we will anno
unce things when we are 
ready.

From Cross Research we will go to Shannon Cross.
 
Shannon Cross

Cross Research
 
Thank yo
u. Tim, can you talk broadly about your discussions with both 
existing and potential carrier partners, I would think that 56% growth in 
Japan might prod one in particular to be interested in some of the coming 
product? And then also there has been some com
ments about Russia and 
just concerns in general about pricing in that, so how sort of in general have 
your discussions with your carrier partners been?
 
Tim Cook
 
I would classify them as being good. The processing on Russia probably 
needs some color. The 
articles I have seen suggested that we are not selling 

referencing if you look at the Russian market, over 80% of smartphones are 
sold in retail. They are outside of carrier
-
owned stores a
nd we sell through a 
number of national chains there, and in fact, our activations in Russia for 
iPhones were set of record last quarter, is our highest quarter in Russia ever. 

sell t
hrough some carrier on stores as well but obviously the contribution is 
much less than the retail organizations and so forth and so I think that's 

relationships to both add and enhance
 
the once we have got and I do think 
there are some opportunities there for us.
 
Shannon Cross 
-
 
Cross Research
 
Okay great and then can you talk a bit about commodities just in terms of 

 
some of, I guess your supply chain is working these days.
 
Tim Cook
 
We certainly have no problem procuring. In terms of where we see pricing 
headed and this would have been factored into the most fortune guys (ph) 
appear a bit earlier. Despite the very, ve
ry weak PC market DRAM pricing 
has actually increased and we see continued upper pressure in this area.
 
NAND pricing is fairly stable and it's following seasonal trends as we would 
expect, both LCDs and HDDs have, the prices have fallen and we would 
expect
 
further reductions in these areas and if you look at other 
commodities they appear to be in supply for an imbalance and so we would 
expect the pricing to decline on these sort of historical levels.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Shannon. Can we have the next questio
n please?

From UBS, we will go to Steve Milunovich.

guidance you have any of these new products assume shipping in the 
quarter?
 
Peter

Steve Milunovich

UBS Securities
 
Okay and then Tim kind of a philosophical question, but whenever you talk 

products, bett
er, be more important than more, Wall
-
Street is kind of in the 
more business. So I just wonder kind of talk about your philosophy and if 
you can come up with a couple of really great products maybe they will 


kind of financial metrics and growth projections as a lot of companies are. 
Maybe tie (ph) that a little bit in your functional organizations, does that 
limit how many products you can actually take to market overtime?
 
Tim Cook
 
Ste

here to make great products and we think that if we focus on that and do 
that really, really well that the financial metrics will also come and so we 

eing mutually exclusive. We see them having 
great overlap and I think if you look at how the company has executed over 

 
Steve Milunovich 
-
 
UBS Securities
 

rowth, what do we 
need to do from a product. It sounds like you go the opposite, what are 
some really great products we can do and if we do that, the metric will take 
care of itself.
 
Tim Cook
 
We started the product because we believe that the most importan
t saying is 


very hard to focus on products and customers, enriching customers and 
making great products.

Thank you Steve. Can we have the next question please?

And we will go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.

end is 

wondering if you could philosophically is the current mix what we should be 

ASPs would continue to trend lower 

least directionally?
 
Tim Cook
 

assumption of the ASP for the current quarter in our guidance obviously to 
come up with the numbers that Peter tal
ked about earlier. If you look 
underneath the iPhone numbers, I think Peter alluded to earlier, we saw 
significant growth clearly in the lower price point year
-
over
-
year which for us 
is iPhone 4, it's still a great product. And that was one of the things a
nd the 
iPhone 5 doing well that allows us to significantly beat what I think is 
probably the vast majority of expectations out there for iPhone sales. And so 

those in the mix change 
that it has changed across the last year. If you look 
at 3GS last year, which was in a comparable position as our entry product, 
we are selling a lot more 4s and 3GSs, I think we both understand the 
market much better and have our things on the pulse of di
stribution in 
different countries and so forth this year. I am sure that we will get better 

 
Typically, for us, a product has the highest mix during its initial few months 
of sales, an
d so you have a natural kind of seasonal decline over time of a 
product cycle that generally happens on iPhone, it generally happens on 
iPad, and we have seen it happen on the Mac over many years. And so I 

 
that, but again, we are 
going to look at this thing quarter
-
by
-
quarter and tell you how we look at 
the quarter and give you guidance forward as we go.
 
Keith Bachman 
-
 
Bank of Montreal
 
Okay, alright. And then Peter for you, there has been a few comments on
 
gross margins and I want to try to broaden out a bit. In the past as you look 
at the one quarter forward which would be the September quarter you have 
given us some of the puts and takes that think about there has been a 
couple of specific questions asked
 
about, but I want to broaden out and see 
if you could just highlight what you think are the puts and takes in the 
September quarter as you see them today, particularly with reference to the 
quarter you just reported? Thank you.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure. I a
m going to keep my comments limited, but I will give you a put and 
a take.
 
Keith Bachman

Okay.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Where I guess the tailwind we would expect our component costs to be 
favorable in the quarter.
 
Keith Bachman

Bank of Montr
eal
 
Okay.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Conversely, we would expect some FX pressure in the quarter given the 
strengthening in the dollar, particularly against the yen.

And from Raymond James we will hear from Tavis McCourt.
 
Tavis McCourt

Raymond James
 
Thanks for taking my question. Peter, first a clarification on the share 
buyback and can you tell us what the ending basic share count was in the 
third quarter?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
All of that is on the income statement, so you got the ending basic and 
diluted, but let me give you a couple of points that I think could be helpful 
for you. During the June quarter, we concluded the first $2 billion ASR 
p
rogram that we started in December and then so we got the final shares in 
on those, and we did our second ASR program of $12 billion, that started at 
the end of April and we received 23.5 million shares initially on that. And I 
went through in my prepared 

program will close and we will get the final number of shares. We also 
bought back 4 billion of stock in the open market during the June quarter 
and received about 9 million shares. So, the impact of those in t
he June 
quarter lowered our diluted share count in the quarter by about 22.9 million 
shares. And as you look forward into the September quarter before any 
further buybacks or any issuance to employees we would expect to see an 
additional approximate 11 mil
lion share benefit from the things that occurred 
during the June quarter.
 
Tavis McCourt

Raymond James
 
Great, thanks. And one for you Tim, one of the comments out of the 

manufacturer m
odels next year. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit 

strategic relevance of that if you are willing to? Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 

 
Tavis 
McCourt

Raymond James
 
I think at the developers conference there was a comment about iOS being 
built into a number of car manufacturing models for next year? I was 
wondering if you can talk about kind of the strategic relevance for that and 
what the busi
ness model might be for that for Apple?
 
Tim Cook
 
I see it is very important. It is a part of the ecosystem, and so just like the 
app store is a key part of the ecosystem and iTunes and all other content are 
key and the services we provide from messaging to
 
and (inaudible) support. 
Having something in the automobile is very, very important, it's something 
that people want and I think that Apple can do this in a unique way better 
than anyone else. So it's a key focus for us.

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon
, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Today we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, 
and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance 
range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent 
execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in 
much of the world and difficult year
-
over
-
year comparisons. We saw 
continued currency weakness in the vast majorit
y of our international 
markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 
400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of 
the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year on year.
 
Despite
 
challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the 
quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow 
strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new
-
to
-
Mac 
customers, and we generated very strong gro
wth from Services. We sold 
51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own 
expectations but lower than the exceptional year
-
ago quarter when we saw 
an acceleration in iPhone upgrades and 40% iPhone sales growth over the 
previous y
ear.
 
To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: 
customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models; customers who switch 
from Android and other operating systems; and customers who purchase a 
smartphone for the first time.
 
As we
 
look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business 
that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the 
first half of this year the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been 
slightly higher than what we experi
enced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years 
ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that we saw with 
iPhone 6, which as you know was a big contributor to our phenomenal 
revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly 
loy
al. A recent Kantar survey of U.S. smartphone purchasers indicated a 
95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smartphone.
 
Second, we continue to see a very high level of customers switching to 
iPhone from Android and other operating syste
ms. In fact, we added more 
switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than 
any other six
-
month period ever.
 
And third, with only 42% smartphone penetration of the global handset 
market today, iPhone is still attracting millio
ns of first
-
time smartphone 
buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in 
India our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago.
 
Next I'd like to talk about Services, which was our second largest revenue
-
generating category during the
 
quarter. Setting aside the amount we 
received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March 
quarter Services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 
20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all
-
tim
e record. And Apple Music continues to grow in popularity, with over 13 
million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success 
of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an 
inflection point after many 
quarters of decline.
 
The Services business is powered by our huge installed base of active 
devices, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on 
this call in January, those 1 billion
-
plus active devices are a source of 
recurring reve
nue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we 
report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our 
installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over 
last year, accelerating from the 24% growth r
ate we reported in the 
December quarter.
 
The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand following a very successful 
launch in China in the March quarter and last week's rollout in Singapore. 
Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than five t
imes the 
transaction volume of a year ago and 1 million new users per week. There 
are more than 10 million contactless
-
ready locations in the countries where 
Apple Pay has launched to date, including over 2.5 million locations now 
accepting Apple Pay in th
e United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay 
is coming soon.
 
Turning to the Mac, we met our sell
-
in expectations in addition to reducing 
channel inventory by about 100,000 units. Overall, the Mac continues to 
attract a large percentage of new customers
. In our latest survey of major 
markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac. And in some countries, 
the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of 
customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our 
Mac busin
ess and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that 
area.
 
Turning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. 
For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expect its 
seasonality to be similar to the hist
orical seasonality of iPod, which typically 
generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell
-
through in the December 
quarter. We started shipping Apple Watch just one year ago, and it has 
quickly become the best
-
selling and most loved smartwatch in the world.
 
In 
fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone 
in its first year.
 
Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a 
new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. 
Apple Wa
tch is an increasingly essential part of users' lives, from responding 
to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping 
them be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped 
save lives. We're really excited about th
e first year with Apple Watch. We 
have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future head.
 
We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. 
IPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected 
in our secon
d quarter results. But so far this quarter we're seeing terrific 
customer response. IPhone SE is the most powerful four
-
inch phone ever, 
and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact 
phone with advanced features and a great pr
ice without compromising 
performance. Demand has been very strong and exceeds supply at this 
point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every 
customer who wants one as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone 
SE in the iPho
ne lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract 
even more customers into our ecosystem.
 
We also unveiled the stunning 9.7
-
inch iPad Pro with cutting
-
edge 
performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new 
iPad Pros have bee
n great, and we're hearing from customers that the 
features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate 
upgrade for iPad owners and a great PC replacement. In the June quarter, 
we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two yea
rs. IPad is 
the best selling, best reviewed, and most used tablet on the market. 
Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, 
capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to 
help them work, play, l
earn, and create.
 
We also announced CareKit, a new software framework that developers can 
use to help people take a more active role in their health by keeping track of 
their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering 
the insights
 
they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're 
very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead 
healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we 
are very interested in where this can take
 
us.
 
As always, we're contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the 
use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain and 
developing cutting
-
edge technologies to revolutionize recycling of the 
materials we use. We are u
nwavering in our commitment to protect the 
security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we're actively 
promoting inclusion and equality across our business.
 
As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we 
measure the he
alth of customer demand based on sell
-
through. Despite 
ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the 
macroeconomic environment, we plan to lower our channel inventories in the 
June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luc
a will provide 
more details on this in his commentary.
 
But before I turn over the call to him, I'll summarize by saying that the 
future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations 
in store. We're very excited about bringing togeth
er developers for our four 
major platforms at our Worldwide Developers Conference in June. We are 
forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in 
our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in 
the last f
our quarters to accelerate our product and Services roadmaps, and 
we're always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, 
and strategic fit.
 
Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services 
that enrich 
people's lives will always be our top priority and the key factor 
driving our investment and capital allocation decisions. As our business 
continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate 
position to expand our capital return pr
ogram again this year, as we have 
done each year since we started the program four years ago. Today we're 
announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters 
through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from 
$200 
billion to $250 billion.
 
Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March 
quarter. Luca?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March 
quarte
r results.
 
Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range of $50.6 billion 
compared to $58 billion in the year
-
ago quarter, a decline of 13%. As we 
had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued 
strength of the U.S. d
ollar against foreign currencies. As Tim said, in 
constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%.
 
On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it 
declined in greater China and the rest of Asia
-
Pacific. However, our business 
in the
se two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We 
had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which 
affected our reported revenue for both these segments.
 
In Mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was
 
7% in 
constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an 
extremely difficult year
-
ago compare when our Mainland China revenue grew 
81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long term, 
and we are committed to investing th
ere for the long run.
 
Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high end of our guidance range, thanks 
to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and 
net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and 
cash flow from ope
rations was strong at $11.6 billion.
 
For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in 
the quarter compared to 61.2 million in the year
-
ago quarter, a decline of 
16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record 
quarter a 
year ago, when iPhone sales grew 40%, as we entered last March quarter in 
supply/demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter. Also, 
this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units while we increased 
inventory by 1 million uni
ts a year ago. We have exited the quarter within 
our five
-
week to seven
-
week target range for channel inventory.
 
iPhone ASP was $642 compared to $659 in the year
-
ago quarter, with weak 
international currencies and very popular mid
-
tier and entry offerings 
contributing to the difference year over year.
 
iPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A 
recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that 
among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in 
the June 
quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter 
iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and five points higher 
than a year ago.
 
Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% 
over the 
March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong 
performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all
-
time 
high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global 
revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, 
up from a 75% lead in 2015. 
Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes 
Store's, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all
-
time 
record in the March quarter.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs c
ompared to 4.6 
million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal 
computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. 
Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double
-
digit Mac growth 
in a number o
f markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the 
UAE.
 
And just last week we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, 
with the latest processors, faster graphics, faster flash storage, and longer 
battery life. We think our customers
 
are going to love this update. We ended 
the quarter within our four
-
week to five
-
week target range for Mac channel 
inventory.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million units compared to 12.6 million units in 
the year
-
ago quarter. We also reduced channel inven
tory by about 200,000 
units, and we exited the quarter within our five
-
week to seven
-
week target 
range.
 
In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be 
highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 78% share 
of th
e U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data 
published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the U.S. 
commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education.
 
iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. 
In February, 451 
Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2. And 
among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 
59% plan to purchase an iPad, more than three times the purchase intention 
rate of the next hi
ghest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% 
satisfaction rate for iPad, and the June quarter purchase intent of 71%.
 
Revenue from other products grew 30% over last year thanks to Apple 
Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries and intr
oduced bands 
in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their 
watches in more ways with a range of colors, styles, and materials. Our 
customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 
94% customer satisfaction.
 
We
're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now 
has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for 
large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our Mobility 
Partner program also continues to grow
, with 108 partners across 20 
countries.
 
We see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform 
how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, 
retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard custom
ers, 
reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, 
doctors and nurses are using iOS apps on iPhone and iPad to share and 
communicate more effectively so that they can spend more time with 
patients and less time on administrativ
e tasks.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $232.9 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 
billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the 
United States. We issued $
15.5 billion in U.S. dollar denominated notes 
during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives 
such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the 
March quarter with $72 billion in term debt.
 
We returned 
$10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion 
in dividends and equivalents and $7 billion on repurchases of 71.8 million 
Apple shares through open market transactions. We have now completed 
over $163 billion of the current $200 billio
n capital return program, including 
$117 billion in share repurchases.
 
As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our 
program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, 
we're allocating the majority of the expansio
n of the program to share 
repurchases. Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we 
see in our stock, the board has increased the share repurchase authorization 
by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billio
n. 
We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock 
units.
 
We also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors 
who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four 
years. The quarter
ly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per 
share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, 
which the board has declared today and is payable on May 12, 2016 to 
shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. We continue to
 
plan for annual 
dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend 
payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the 
world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we 
expect to return $87
 
billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of 
our market cap at the current stock price.
 
As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, 
future U.S. cash flow generation, and borrowing from both domestic and 
internat
ional debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation 
regularly and solicit input on our program from a broad base of 
shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and 
the pace of the program.
 
As we move ahead into the 
June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion 
and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year
-
over
-
year decline as 
we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year where revenue grew 33%, 
due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is 
compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year and the 
strong U.S. dollar, 
which affects our revenue growth in international 
markets.
 
Embedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth 
over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel 
inventory position given the current macro environment. 
The guidance also 
reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into 
supply/demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected 
demand is greater than the revenue range implies.
 
Sequentially, our guidance implies a r
evenue decline of 15% to 19%, which 
is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the 
March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated 
channel inventory adjustments I just described. We expect seasonal 
sequenti
al declines in iPhone and iPad sales and a sequential increase in Mac 
sales. We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get farther 
from the launch of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and as iPhone SE enters the 
mix.
 
We know that our 
revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the 
third quarter. We believe the difference comes primarily from three areas: 
first, the $2 billion
-
plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned; 
second, the effect of the channel inventory reducti
on and the launch of 
iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of 
iPhone SE; and third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow 
sequentially at a rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June 
quarters.
 
We 
expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect 
continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss 
of leverage from lower revenue and a different mix of products. We expect 
OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. 
We expect OI&E to be about 
$300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

First we'll hear with Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.

Hi, thank you so much. My 
first question was actually just a clarification in 
terms of putting in context that $2 billion in channel inventory reduction. 
What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year
-
over
-
year basis?
 
And then the bigger question, Tim, was w
ith the smartphone market now 
reaching a pretty mature growth phase, how does Apple think of itself going 
forward? Is it as a growth company, or is it a more mature tech company? 
And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&A, 
e
specially given the position you're in with your balance sheet strategically?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
Simona, let me give you the data points on the sell
-
through, and then I'll let 
Tim answer the strategic question. W
e had a channel inventory reduction 
that was worth a bit less than $800 million a year ago.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Simona, hi, it's Tim. In terms of do I think the smartphone market
 
is mature, I think that the market, as y
ou know, is currently not growing. 
However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic 
environment in many different places in the world. And we're very optimistic 
that this too shall pass and that the market and particularly us will grow 
a
gain.
 
The reason that we're optimistic is we look at the three places that iPhone 
sales come from. And from an upgrade point of view as I mentioned in my 
comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle 
that we saw on the iPhone 5s. W
e're lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all 
of us know that that was an extraordinary cycle that accelerated upgrades 
from 2016 into 2015. And so that comparable will be tough for this year, but 
that's a transitory thing.
 
As we look at switchers, we're e
xtremely excited that for the first half we set 
a record from switchers from other platforms, the largest we've ever seen in 
any six
-
month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on 
emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%
, and we're 
placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be 
disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas.
 
The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract 
even more customers into the platform 
with an incredible product that is at a 
new price point for us with the latest technology, and so we're optimistic 
about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our 
pipeline, and we're very excited about what's in our pipeline. And so all
 
of 
those things make me optimistic.
 
Your other question was on M&A. Regardless of the first, we're always 
looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do 
today, become features in something we do, or allow us to accelerate entry
 
into a category that we're excited about. And so as I said before, our test is 
not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we've bought 
thus far. It's more about the strategic fit and whether it's a great technology 
and great people. An
d so we continue to look and we stay very active in the 
M&A market.

From

Eugene Charles Munster

Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone ASP trends? 
And specifically, you mentioned that the iPhone SE is going to impact it. But 
h
ow are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there 
and your actual market share and using price to close that gap? Is it just the 
iPhone SE, or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted to 
try to be more aggressive in
 
emerging markets?
 
And one for Luca, can you talk a little bit about the Services segment in 
terms of what piece of the services is driving growth, and maybe a little bit 
about the profitability on a net basis versus a gross basis that you've 
referred to in the past? Thanks.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Gene, I think the iPhone SE is attracting two types of customers. One is 
customers that wanted the latest technology but wanted it in a more 
compact package, and we c
learly see even more people than we thought in 
that category. And then secondly, it's attracting people who aspire to own an 
iPhone but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've 
established a new entry. And so I think both of these
 
markets are very, very 
important to us, and we're really excited about where it can take us. I do 
think that we will be really happy with the new
-
to
-
iPhone customers that we 
see from here because of the early returns we've had. We are currently 
supply con
strained, but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some 
point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it. I'll let Luca 
comment on the ASPs.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
So on the ASPs, Gene, we mentione
d that we're going to be down 
sequentially. And this is really the combination of two factors when we go 
from the March quarter to the June quarter. It's the fact that we are having 
the iPhone SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a 
down
ward pressure on ASP. And also this channel inventory reduction that 
we've talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come 
from higher
-
end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on 
ASPs.
 
The question on Services, when we 
look at our Services business, it's 
obviously growing very well across the board. The biggest element and the 
part of the Services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, 
is the App Store. It's interesting for us that our Music business, whic
h had 
been declining for a number of quarters, now that we have both a download 
model and a streaming model, we have now hit an inflection point. And we 
really believe that this will be the bottom and we can start growing from 
there over time. We have many
 
other Services businesses that are doing 
very well. We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster 
than the App Store from a much lower base, but I think it's important for us 
as we continue to develop these businesses.
 
Tim has talked abo
ut Apple Pay. It doesn't provide a meaningful financial 
contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that 
are going through Apple Pay right now and we think ahead for the long 
term, that could be an interesting business for us a
s well.
 
From a profitability standpoint, we had mentioned last time that when you 
look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, 
the profitability of the business is similar to company average. Of course, 
when you net out the
 
amount that is paid to developers and you look at it in 
terms of what is reported in our P&L, obviously that business has a 
profitability that is higher than company average. We don't get into the 
specifics of specific products or services, but it's very 
clear it's significantly 
higher than company average.

Katy Huberty
 
with Morgan Stanley.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. First for Luca, this is the worst gross margin guide in a year 
and a half or so. And over the last couple of quarters, you've talked about a 
number of tailwinds, includin
g component cost, the lower accounting 
deferrals that went into effect in September. You just mentioned the 
Services margins are above corporate average. So the question is, are some 
of those tailwinds winding down, or is the significant guide down in gros
s 
margins for the June quarter entirely related to volume and the iPhone 5 SE? 
And then I have a follow
-
up for Tim.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
Katy, clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we 
conti
nue to expect cost improvements. The other dynamics that you've 
mentioned are still there. Obviously, what is different and particularly as we 
look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we will have 
lots of leverage, and that obvious
ly is going to have a negative impact on 
margins.
 
And the other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of 
products. And particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning 
to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things
 
that are affecting not 
only ASPs, but obviously they also affect margins. And it's the fact that we 
had a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got 
the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. And so 
when
 
you take into account those factors, those are the big elements that 
drive our guidance range right now.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay, thank you, and then a question for Tim. I appreciate the optimism 
around longer
-
term iPhone unit
 
growth, but with developed market 
penetration in the 

 
anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to 
have to come from new markets. You've talked about India. Can you just 
spend a little bit more time on that market? What are some of the hurdles 
you ha
ve to overcome for that to be a larger part of the business? When 
should we expect Apple to have more distribution and specifically your own 
stores in that country? Thanks.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Katy, in the short term, l
et me just make a couple of comments on the 
developed markets just to make sure this is clear. If you look at our installed 
base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%. And so 
when you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would h
ave varying 
rates on it. As I talked about it in the comments, the iPhone 6s upgrade rate 
is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s but lower than the iPhone 6. But the 
other multiplier in that equation is obviously the size of the installed base. 
And so the n
ut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good 
business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off. 
And it's our jobs to come up with great products that people desire, and also 
to continue to attract over Android swi
tchers. With our worldwide share, 
there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets as well.
 
And from an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a 
different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhap
s 
but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began 
this year, and so we'll begin to see some really good networks coming on in 
India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that 
an older network, a 2.5
G or even some 3G networks, would not do. And so 
the infrastructure is one key. The second one is building the channel out. 
Unlike the U.S., as an example, where the carriers in the U.S. sell the vast 
majority of phones that are sold in the United States, 
in India the carriers in 
general sell virtually no phones. And so it's out in retail, and retail is many, 
many different small shops.
 
And so we've been in the process 

 
it's not something that we just started in 
the last few weeks. We've been working in In
dia now for a couple of years or 
more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or 
so, and I'm encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there, and 
believe there's a lot, lot more there. It is already the third largest 
s
martphone market in the world. But because the smartphones that are 
working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the 
economics, the market potential has not been as great there. But I view 
India as where China was maybe seven to ten year
s ago from that point of 
view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there.

Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with 
Bernstein.
 
A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. I have one and then a follow
-
up as well. My sense is that 
you talked about adjusting for the changes in channel inventory, that you're 
guiding for relatively normal sequential
 
growth. And I think if you do the 
math, it's probably the same or perhaps a touch worse in terms of iPhone 
unit growth sequentially relative to normal seasonality between fiscal Q2 and 
Q3. I guess the question is, given that you should be entering new mar
kets 
and you should see pronounced elasticity from the iPhone SE device, why 
wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal 
seasonal in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter?
 
Maybe you could push back on me, but I can't he
lp thinking that when Apple 
introduced the iPad mini in a similar move to move down
-
market, there was 
great growth for one quarter, and the iPad never grew again, and margins 
and ASPs went down. And it looks like you're introducing the SE, and at 
least on 
a sequential basis, you're not calling for any uplift even adjusting 
for channel inventory. And ASPs I presume will go down and certainly it's 
impacting gross margins, as you've guided to. So could you respond to, A), 
why you're not seeing the elasticity? 
And, B), is the analogy with the iPad 
mini completely misplaced?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Toni, it's Tim. Let me see if I can address your question. The channel 
inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast major
ity of that is in 
iPhone, and so that would affect the unit compare that you may be thinking 
about. The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on 
it. It is clear that there is a demand there even much beyond what we 
thought. And so th
at is really why we have the constraint that we have.
 
And so do I think it will be like the iPad mini? No, I don't think so. I don't see 
that. I think that the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the 
tablet market is that the replacement c
ycle is materially different than in the 
smartphone market. And so as you probably know, we haven't had an issue 
in customer satisfaction on the iPad. It's incredibly high. And we haven't had 
an issue with usage of the iPad. The usage is incredibly high. B
ut the 
consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for a very long period of 
time before an upgrade.
 
We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business. And as I had said in 
my remarks, we believe we're going to have the best compare for iPad 
revenu
e this quarter that we have had in quite some time. And so we'll 
report back in July on that one. But I think iPhone has a particularly different 
kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.
 
A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. And if
 
I can follow up, Tim, you alluded to replacement cycles and 
differences between the iPad and the iPhone. My sense was when you were 
going through the iPhone 6 cycle was that you had commented that the 
upgrade cycle was not materially different. I think yo
ur characterization was 
that it accelerated a bit in the U.S. but international had grown to be a 
bigger part of your business, and replacement cycles there were typically a 
little bit longer. And so I'm wondering. If there was only a modest difference 
bet
ween the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6, how big a difference are we really 
seeing in terms of replacement cycles across the last three generations? And 
maybe you can help us. If the replacement cycle was flat this year relative 
to what you saw last year, how 
different would your results have been this 
quarter and the first half?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
There's a lot there. Let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you 
said I said about the upgrade cycle. Let me get 
that out of the way. Now let 
me describe without the specific numbers. The iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that 
we've measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our 
fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw w
ith the 
iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. I don't mean just 
a hair lower. It's a lot lower. And so without giving you exact numbers, if we 
would have the same rate on iPhone 6s that we did iPhone 6, it would be 
time for a huge part
y. It would be a huge difference.
 
Now the good news is 

 
the great news from my point of view is I think 
we're strategically positioned very well because we've announced the iPhone 
SE. We are attracting customers that we previously didn't attract. That's 
r
eally great. And this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark. And 
the installed base is up 80% over the last two years. And so all of those I 
think bode well. And the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't 
underestimate that because that's very
 
important for us in every geography. 
So thanks for the question.

From Cross Research Group, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.
 
Shannon S. Cross 
-
 
Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much. I have a couple questions. One, Tim, can you talk a 
bit about what's going on in China? I know the Greater China revenue I think 
was down 
26%. You did talk about Mainland China. But just if you could, talk 
about some of the trends you're seeing there and how you think it's playing 
out, and maybe your thoughts on iPhone SE adoption within China as well.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive O
fficer & Director
 
Shannon, thanks for the question. If you take Greater China, we include 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China in the Greater China segment that 
you see reported on your data sheet. The vast majority of the weakness in 
the Greater China re
gion sits in Hong Kong. And our perspective on that is 
it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the U.S. dollar, 
and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the U.S. dollar. And 
that has driven tourism, international shopping, 
and trading down 
significantly compared to what it was in the year ago.
 
If you look at Mainland China, which is one that I am personally very 
focused on, we are down 11% in Mainland China on a reported basis. On a 
constant currency basis, we're only down 7
%. And the way that we really 
look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell
-
through. And if you 
look at it there, we were down 5%. And keep in mind that that's down 5% 
on a comp a year ago that was up 81%.
 
And so as I back up from this and look a
t the larger picture, I think China is 
not weak as has been talked about. I see China as may not have the wind at 
our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the 
common view of it. And so we remain really optimistic on China
. We opened 
seven stores there during the quarter. We now are at 35. We'll open five 
more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before. And the 
LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it. And 
so we continue to
 
be really optimistic about it and just would ask folks to 
look underneath the numbers at the details of them before concluding 
anything. Thanks for the question.
 
Shannon S. Cross 
-
 
Cross Research LLC
 
Okay, thanks. And then my second question is with regar
d to OpEx leverage 
or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our 
expectations, but OpEx is pretty much in line. So how are you thinking about 
potential for leverage, I don't know, cost containment maybe when macro is 
bad and reven
ue is under pressure? And how are you juggling that versus 
the required investment you need to go forward?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
Shannon, it's Luca. Of course we think about it. We think about it a lot. And 
so 
when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for 
the March quarter was up 10%, which is the lowest rate that you've seen in 
years. And when you look within OpEx, you actually see two different 
dynamics. You see continued significant
 
investments in research and 
development because we really believe that's the future of the company. We 
continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue. We have a 
much broader portfolio than we used to have. We do much more in
-
house 
technol
ogy development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think 
is a great investment for us to make. And so that part we really need to 
protect and we want to continue to invest in the business.
 
And then when you look at our SG&A portion of OpEx for th
e March quarter, 
it was actually down slightly. So obviously, we think about it, and of course 
we look at our revenue trend and we take measures accordingly. And when 
you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% 
year
-
over
-
year i
ncrease that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes 
down to a range of 7% to 9% up. And again, the focus is on making 
investments in R&D and continuing to run SG&A extremely tightly and in a 
very disciplined way. As you know, our E
-
to
-
R, expense
-
to
-
revenue ratio, is 
around 10%. It's something that we're very proud of. It's a number that is 
incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it 
that way. At the same time, we don't want to underinvest in the business.

UBS 
Securities LLC
 
Thank you. Tim, I first wanted to ask you about Services, and how do you 
view Services? You've obviously highlighted it the last two quarters. Do you 
view it going forward as a primary driver of earnings, or do you view it 

 
you 
mentioned pl
atforms in terms of your operating systems, which I would 
agree with. And in that scenario, I would argue it's more a supporter of the 
ecosystem and a supporter of the hardware margins over time and therefore 
somewhat subservient to hardware. So it's great
 
that it's growing, but longer 
term, I would view its role as more creating ecosystem that supports the 
high margins on hardware as opposed to independently driving earnings. 
How do you think about it?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Direct
or
 
The most important thing for us, Steve, is that we want to have a great 
customer experience. So overwhelmingly, the thing that drives us are to 
embark on services that help that and become a part of the ecosystem. The 
reality is that in doing so, we hav
e developed a very large and profitable 
business in the Services area. And so we felt last quarter and working up to 
that that we should pull back the curtain so that people could 

 
our investors 
could see the Services business both in terms of the scale o
f it and the 
growth of it. As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base 
services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over 
the previous quarter. And the value of it hit just 

 
or was just shy of $10 
billion. And so it's
 
huge, and we felt it was important to spell that out.
 
Steven M. Milunovich 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. And then going back to the upgrades of the installed base, you clearly 
mentioned that you've pulled forward some demand, which makes sense. 
But there doe
s seem to be a lengthening of the upgrade cycle, particularly in 
the U.S. AT&T and Verizon have talked about that. Investors I think perceive 
that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less currently 
and could be less going forward. At the 
same time, I think you just 
announced that you can get the upgrade program online, which I guess 
potentially could shorten it. Do you believe that upgrade cycles are currently 
lengthening and can continue to do so?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Off
icer & Director
 
What we've seen is that it depends on what you compare it to. If you 
compare to the iPhone 5s, what we're seeing is the upgrade rate today is 
slightly higher or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a 
similar time period in 
terms of rate than the iPhone 5s. But if you compare 
to iPhone 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. And so I 
think it depends on people's reference points. And we thought it very 
important in this call to be very clear and transparent ab
out what we are 
seeing. And so I think in retrospect, you can look at it and say, well maybe 
the appropriate measure is more to the iPhone 5s, and I think everybody 
intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the iPhone 6. In 
retrospect, wh
en you look at the periods, they clearly were.

Thanks, guys, for fitting me in. I wanted to start with a more general 
question. I guess. Tim, this one is aimed at you. As you think about where 
you thought things were going to head last quarter when you repor
ted to us 
and how it's changed this quarter, obviously this kind of a disappointing 
demand environment. Can you just help us understand what maybe the top 
two or three things are that have changed, so as we walk away from this we 
understand what the differ
ences are and what the direction of change is? 
And I've got a follow up.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
I think, Rod, you're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if 
you will, from last quarter. And when we made tha
t, we did not contemplate 
or comprehend that we were going to make a $2 billion
-
plus reduction in 
channel inventory during this quarter. And so if you factor that in and look at 
true customer demand, which is the way that we look at it internally, I think 
you'll find a much more reasonable comparison.
 
Rod B. Hall 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay, great. Thank you. And then for my follow
-
up, I wanted to ask you 
about the tax situation a little bit. Treasury obviously has made some rule 
changes, and I wonder ma
ybe if, Luca, you could comment on what the 
impact to Apple from those is, if anything; and, Tim, maybe more broadly, 
how you guys see the tax situation for Apple looking forward? Thanks.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice 
President
 
Yes. Rod, these are new regulations. We are in the process of assessing 
them. Frankly, from first read, we don't anticipate that they're going to have 
any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion 
transactions, so obv
iously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are 
around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use, so we 
don't expect any issue there. As you know, we are the largest U.S. taxpayer 
by a wide margin, and we already pay full U.S. tax on 
all the profits from the 
sales that we make in the United States. So we don't expect them to have 
any impact on us.
 
On tax reform, maybe I can continue, and I'll let Tim provide more color, but 
we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax re
form in this 
country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would 
have significant benefits for the entire U.S. economy, and we remain 
optimistic that we're going to get to a point where we can see that tax 
reform enacted. At that point
 
in time, of course, we would have much more 
flexibility around optimizing our capital structure and around providing more 
return of capital to our investors.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
The only thing I would add, Rod, is I th
ink there are a growing number of 
people in both parties that would like to see comprehensive reform, and so 
I'm optimistic that it will occur. It's just a matter of when. And that's difficult 
to say, but I think most people do recognize that it's in the U
.S.'s interest to 
do this.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
 
Tim 
Cook
 
Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. 
Before we begin, I joined the many millions across this country in mourning 
and memorialize Congressman John Lewis, who was laid to rest earlier 
today. We've lost a hero who w
alked among us, a leader in the truest sense 
who urged this country to aim higher and be better until the very end.
 
I was humbled and fortunate to know him and as an Alabama native his 
example inspires me still. It now falls to every American to be a livin
g 
memorial to John Lewis and to carry forward the work and the mission that 
defined his life. Throughout the call I'll speak in greater detail about Apple's 
support for equity and justice topics of great urgency on a number of fronts, 
but first I want to p
ull the lens back to consider the quarter and full. In an 
uncertain environment Apple saw a quarter of historic results demonstrating 
the important role our products play in our customers' lives.
 
We set a June quarter record with revenue of $59.7 billion, 
up 11% from a 
year ago. Both products and services set June quarter records and grew 
double
-
digits and revenue grew in each of our geographic segments, 
reflecting the broad base of this success.
 
As always and especially in times of real adversity, what mak
es us proud as 
a company is not merely what we did, but how we did it. As millions March 
for justice in big cities and small towns alike, we committed a $100 million to 
launch Apple's racial equity and justice initiative as well as new and renewed 
internal
 
efforts to foster diversity and inclusion at all levels of the company.
 
As COVID
-
19 continues to represent great risks for individuals and great 
uncertainty for our communities, care and adaptability are defining how we 
conduct our work wherever we work. 
In some places that has met 
responsibly reopening our operations and retail stores with enhanced health 
and safety precautions. In others, where the virus has reemerge it's meant 
taking the challenging, but necessary step of re
-
closing stores.
 
I'll touch o
n these topics more in a little bit. But first I want to offer some 
more context on the quarter's results. Due to the uncertain and ongoing 
impacts of COVID
-
19, we did not provide our typical guidance when we 
reported our results last quarter, but we did p
rovide some color on how we 
expected the June quarter to play out. I'd like to contextualize our results in 
terms of that color across each of our product categories beginning with 
iPhone.
 
iPhone revenue grew 2% this quarter. In April, we expected year
-
ove
r
-
year 
performance to worsen, but we saw better
-
than
-
expected demand in May 
and June. We attribute this increase in demand to several interactive causes 
including a strong iPhone SE launch, continued economic stimulus, and 
potentially some benefit from she
lter in place restrictions lifting around the 
world.
 
We expected iPad and Mac growth to accelerate and we saw very strong 
double
-
digit growth for these devices this quarter. This remarkable 
performance came in spite of supply constraints on both products. 
We're 
working hard to get more iPads and Macs into customers' hands as quickly 
as possible recognizing how integral they have become to working and 
learning from home providing entertainment and staying connected with 
loved ones. Wearables growth decelerat
ed as we expected, but still grew by 
strong double
-
digits and set a revenue record for a non
-
holiday quarter. 
Building on powerful new features built into watchOS 7 and AirPods Pro 
announced this quarter, we are very excited about the many opportunities in
 
front of us for this product category.
 
These strong results helped drive our installed base of active devices to new 
all
-
time records across each of our product categories. Reflecting the deep 
integration of hardware, software and services, services gener
ated a June 
quarter record of $13.2 billion, up 15% year
-
over
-
year. As we mentioned 
during our last call, there were two distinct trends we were seeing and they 
played out as we thought. First, results for advertising and AppleCare were 
impacted by the red
uced level of economic activity and store closures to a 
degree that was in line with our expectations.
 
Second, we had strong performance in our digital services with all
-
time 
revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services as 
well a
s elevated engagement on iMessage, Siri and FaceTime. Customers are 
loving new offerings across Apple services like Apple News today, our new 
daily audio briefing and Greyhound, our new summer blockbuster starring 
Tom Hanks. In fact, Apple TV+ just hit a h
istory making 95 awards 
nominations and 25 wins and accolades. Based on these results and our 
performance over the last four quarters, we are proud to announce that we 
have achieved our goal of doubling. Our fiscal 2016 services revenue six 
months ahead of
 
schedule. We're conscious of the fact that these results 
stand in stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses 
large and small and certainly for families.
 
We do not have a zero
-
sum approach to prosperity and especially in times 
lik
e this, we are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't 
just our success and that everything we make, build or do is geared towards 
creating opportunities for others. The App Store is a great example. This 
quarter, a new study by independe
nt economists at the Analysis Group 
founded the App Store facilitated more than 0.5 trillion in commerce globally 
in 2019 alone. Especially in a time of COVID
-
19, you can measure economic 
resilience in the ways in which the App Store supports remote orderi
ng for 
restaurants, digital commerce for small businesses and an enduring 
entrepreneurial opportunity for creators and visionaries. Keeping learning 
vibrant and impactful in the time of COVID
-
19 is a priority everyone shares.
 
Earlier this month, we announc
ed significant enhancements to the 
development Swift and Everyone Can Code curricula and we launched a new 
professional learning course available exclusively to educators. In just two 
weeks ago, our Community Education initiative added 10 more historically
 
black college and university regional coding centers to our roster, bringing 
the total to 24 locations nationwide, 12 of which are HBCUs and 21 of which 
serve majority black and brown student populations.
 
In Apple's backyard, we announced that we are allo
cating $400 million of 
our multi
-
year $2.5 billion affordable housing commitment to new housing 
construction, homebuyer assistance programs and support for those at 
greatest risk of experiencing homelessness across Silicon Valley. Apple's 
results this quar
ter are only possible due to our people and their ongoing 
ingenuity, flexibility, resilience and determination during these ever
-
changing times.
 
I want to thank our AppleCare and retail teams who have paired exceptional 
service during a time of intense dem
and with great adaptability during a 
quarter where stores have reopened in some places and reclosed in others. 
A dedicated team of specialists and experts has shouldered the task of 
caring for the well
-
being of our teams and communities store by store, 
loc
ation by location with evidence driven granularity and agility that is 
unrivaled anywhere. Innovation from adversity certainly define this year's 
Worldwide Developers Conference as well. This is an event where 
traditionally Apple's worldwide community of d
evelopers gathers together to 
share, celebrate and do big things together.
 
Though we could not be together in person, Apple set a new standard for 
what online events can achieve with our celebrated all virtual event. The 
results here speak for themselves. 
More than 22 million viewers tuned in 
across all of Apple streams. For our developers we distributed more than 72 
hours of video content. That's three full days of video. The weak saw more 
than 200 direct video engineering and design sessions and about 450
0 
person to person appointments with developers across 227 virtual labs.
 
And of course that's even before you get to this year's announcements from 
iOS 14, which boasts the radical redesign to the home screen, powerful 
updates to messages, streamlined and 
effortless app clips and even greater 
privacy transparency and controls to major updates to Apple Pencil, Siri and 
calling and iPad OS 14 to much anticipated sleep tracking, new fitness and 
wellness features and unprecedented customization and watchOS 7 to
 
the 
new macOS Big Sur boasting the biggest redesign upgrade to macOS since 
OS X. No less important for Apple's innovation roadmap is our transition to 
Apple silicon for the Mac. This two
-
year effort will achieve both 
unprecedented performance for the Mac 
and a common architecture across 
all Apple products.
 
Looking forward, we are profoundly optimistic about Apple's future and we 
recognize that with this success comes some real responsibility to lead with 
our values because those values help make that succe
ss possible in the first 
place. We are just as proud of our announcement this month that Apple will 
be fully carbon
-
neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and including 
the energy use of every device we make as we are of any hardware 
innovation bec
ause they spring from the same instinct to leave the world 
better than we found it. We're committed to standing with those marching 
for the lives and dignity through our new $100 million commitment to 
Apple's racial equity and justice initiative, and we're
 
deepening our diversity 
and inclusion efforts internally because our future as a business is 
inextricably linked with the future of our communities.
 
There are times when things seem to move slowly when needed progress, 
economic or social themes bogged dow
n when the instinct to turn away from 
the horizon and hold onto what you've got fields and ex
-
capable, and then 
there are times like this when people of goodwill step forward, when 
progressed on Moore's itself, when the insistence of hope forces something 
new. This is an immensely challenging moment. COVID
-
19 is still 
devastating many places and we have work left to do to care for the health 
and well
-
being of the communities in which all of us live and work. But no 
community of people, whether a company or 
a country, can afford to miss 
this call when it comes. At Apple, we never have and we don't intend to start 
now.
 
With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter was a 
testament to 
Apple's ability to innovate and execute during challenging 
times. Our results speak to the resilience of our business and the relevance 
of our products and services in our customers' lives.
 
Total revenue was $59.7 billion, a new June quarter record, up 11%
 
from a 
year ago, despite a 300 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Our 
performance was strong across our entire portfolio as we grew revenue in 
each of our product categories and set June quarter records for Mac, for 
Wearables and for services. Si
milarly, our results were very strong all 
around the world with growth in all geographic segments and new June 
quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, in Japan and Rest of Asia
-
Pacific. 
Products revenue was $46.5 billion, up 10% and a June quarter reco
rd. 
iPhone returned to growth and we saw very strong double
-
digit growth from 
iPad, Mac and Wearables. Lockdowns and point of sale closures were 
widespread during April and impacted our performance, but we saw demand 
for all products improve significantly 
in May and June.
 
As a result of our strong performance and the unmatched loyalty of our 
customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all
-
time high in all 
of our geographic segments and all major product categories. Our services 
continue to gr
ow strongly up 15% year
-
over
-
year and reached a June 
quarter record of $13.2 billion. We set all
-
time records in many services 
categories and June quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover 
this in more detail later.
 
Company gross margin was 38
%. This was down 40 basis points 
sequentially due to unfavorable FX of 90 basis points and a different mix of 
products partially offset by cost savings and services mix. Products gross 
margin was 29.7% decreasing 60 basis points sequentially due to FX and 
a 
different mix partially offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 
67.2% up 180 basis points sequentially mainly due to mix.
 
Net income was $11.3 billion and earnings per share were $2.58, up 18% 
and a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was 
also a June quarter 
record at $16.3 billion, an improvement of $4.6 billion over a year ago. Let 
me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.
 
iPhone revenue grew 2% to $26.4 billion with customer demand improving 
as the quarter progressed. C
OVID
-
19 was most impactful during the first 
three weeks of April when lockdowns and point of sale closures became 
more widespread in many countries. We saw marked improvement around 
the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of 
cust
omer demand helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and 
economic stimulus packages. Our active installed base of iPhones again 
reached an all
-
time high as a result of the loyalty of our customer base and 
strength of our ecosystem. In fact in the 
US the latest survey of consumers 
from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 
11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.
 
Turning to services, as I said, we set a June quarter record of $13.4 billion of 
revenue. We had all
-
time recor
d performance and strong double
-
digit growth 
in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services. Our new services 
Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card are also contributing 

nd features. 
At the same time customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow 
at a fast pace. The number of both transacting and paid accounts on our 
digital content stores reached a new all
-
time high during the June quarter 
with paid accounts incre
asing double
-
digits in each of our geographic 
segments.
 
In aggregate, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially and 
we now have over 550 million paid subscriptions across the services on our 
platform, up 130 million from a year ago. With th
is momentum we remain 
confident to reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions 
before the end of calendar 2020.
 
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new June quarter record 
with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year. Our 
Wearables 
business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company and we set June quarter 
records in the majority of markets we track. Importantly Apple Watch 
continues to extend its reach with over 75% of the customers purchasing 
Apple Watch during the quarter 
new to the product.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the impressive performance of Mac. Revenue was 
$7.1 billion, up 22% over last year and a June quarter record. We grew 
double digits in each geographic segment and set all
-
time revenue records in 
Japan and re
st of Asia
-
Pacific as well as June quarter records in the Americas 
and Europe.
 
Customer response to our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro launches has 
been extremely strong. iPad performance was equally impressive with 
revenue of $6.6 billion, up 31% and our
 
highest June quarter revenue in 
eight years. Demand was strong around the world with double
-
digit growth 
in each of our geographic segments, including a June quarter record in 
Greater China.
 
The launch of our new iPad Pro has been received incredibly well
 
in every 
region of the world. Both Mac and iPad are extremely relevant products in 
the new working and learning environments and the most recent surveys of 
consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 96% for 
Mac and 97% for iPad.
 
Around 
half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter 
were new to that product. And as a result, the active installed base for both 
products reached a new all
-
time high. Our retail business had record June 
quarter revenue. Thanks to the performa
nce of our online store which had 
records in all geographic segments and grew across all major product 
categories.
 
In June, we launched Apple Card Monthly Installments for more products in 
our US stores allowing customers to pay for their devices all the t
ime with 
0% interest. We're very pleased with the level of customer interest this new 
offering has generated. In the enterprise market, we continue to see 
companies leverage Apple products and offerings to successfully navigate 
their businesses through COV
ID
-
19. In healthcare, we are seeing rapid 
acceleration of telehealth to support a more flexible model of patient care. 
Many hospitals such as UVA Health, Rush University Medical Center and UC 
San Diego Health are using apps on iPad and iPhone to have triag
e, monitor 
and care for patients who are at home. This helps free up hospital capacity 
to support patients who need inpatient care while enabling continued care 
for patients who do not require in
-
person visits.
 
Since many call center employees are currentl
y working remotely, Apple 
Business Chat has proven an invaluable tool for staying connected with 
customers. This quarter HSBC deployed Apple Business Chat in its US and 
UK contact centers. Apple Business Chat provides a flexible and secured 
channel for dig
ital banking assistance through a native Apple experience 
improving the efficiency and experience for both customers and agents.
 
We are seeing similar adoption by hundreds of other organizations. Let me 
now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter w
ith almost $194 billion 
in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $8.5 billion of new term debt, 
retired $7.4 billion of term debt and increased short
-
term borrowing facilities 
by $1.1 billion during the quarter leaving us with total debt of $113 billi
on. 
As a result, net cash was $81 billion at the end of the quarter and we 
continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We 
returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the June quarter, including 
$3.7 billion in dividends and
 
equivalents and $10 billion through open 
market repurchases of 31.3 million Apple shares. We also began a $6 billion 
accelerated share repurchase program in May resulting in the initial delivery 
and retirement of 15.2 million shares.
 
And finally, we retir
ed an additional 4.8 million shares in the final settlement 
of our 15th ASR. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to 
provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of 
forward
-
looking information that Tejas referred to a
t the beginning of the 
call.
 
Similar to last quarter, given the uncertainty around the world in the near
-
term, we will not be issuing revenue and margin guidance for the coming 
quarter. However, we will provide some additional insight on our 
expectations f
or the September quarter for our product categories.
 
On iPhone, we expect to see recent performance continue for our current 
product lineup, including the strong customer response for iPhone SE. In 
addition, as you know, last year we started selling new iP
hones in late 
September. This year we project supply to be available a few weeks later. 
We expect the rest of our product categories to have strong year
-
over
-
year 
performance. For services, we expect the September quarter to have the 
same trends that we ha
ve observed during the June quarter except for 
AppleCare where during the September quarter a year ago we expanded our 
distribution significantly.
 
As a consequence, we expect a difficult comp for AppleCare also considering 
the COVID related point of sale c
losures this year. For gross margin, keep in 
mind that we will have a different mix than in prior years as I just explained.
 
For OpEx, we expect to be between $9.8 billion and $9.9 billion. We expect 
the tax rate to be about 16.5% and OI&E to be $50 millio
n. Also today our 
Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of 
common stock payable on August 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of 
August 10, 2020.
 
And finally, today we're announcing a four for one split of Apple common 
stock 
to make our stock more accessible to a broader base of investors. 
Each shareholder of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020 will 
receive three additional shares for every outstanding share held on the 
record date and trading will begin on a sp
lit
-
adjusted basis on August 31st, 
2020.
 
With that let's open the call to questions.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, 
may we please have the first question?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Yes, tha
t will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim in light of the economic adversity that you 
talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how 
Apple is leveraging finance and trade
-
in 
programs to make technology more 
affordable and accessible during this period, while also addressing the 
opportunity to recycle and reuse products and maybe also extend that to 
how these programs might expand over time and then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes. As Luca mentioned, in June we actually rolled out to the overwhelming 
balance of our other products the ability to do interest rate, interest free 
financing in our stores with payments. And that's in addition to trade
-
in 
which is becoming a more comm
on trend now which I think is terrific 
because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy, if you will, 
against the price of the new phone. And so when you compound these two 
things with the financing and the trade
-
in it makes the product sup
er 
affordable. And we're really happy with what we're seeing in that regard.
 
Katy Huberty
 
And then, as a follow
-
up, just specifically to iPhone the category returned to 
growth. As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. Our math 
would suggest 
that replacement cycles in some cases are elongated. And 
then you have the affordability element that you just discussed. Does all of 
that combine to build confidence that we're entering a longer period of 
iPhone revenue growth after what's been six quarte
rs of decline?
 
Tim Cook
 
We're very pleased with how we did on iPhone. It was better than we 
thought largely because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks May and 
June were much better. If you look at iPhone in totality the things that get 
me very optim
istic is the size of the active installed base. The fact that if you 
look in the major geographies like the US, we had the top two selling 
smartphones. In the UK we had three of the top four. In Australia, we had 
five of the top six. And in Japan we had th
e top four. Urban China we were, 
iPhone 11 was the top selling smartphone in the country. And so these are 
some very different geographies with their very different competitive 
situations and we're doing fairly well.
 
The iPhone SE, it's also clear that fro
m the early data we're seeing a higher 
switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good 
about. And it also seems to appeal to some people that were holding onto 
the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor p
hone. 
And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly 
affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. iPhone 11 is still the most 
popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. And as we 
-
-
 
as Lucas said in his outlo
ok, we do see that continuing into this quarter 
currently.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Katy.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.
 
Tim Cook
 
Thank you so much.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Yes, that would be from Krish San
kar with Cowen & Company.
 
Krish Sankar
 
Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, Tim, when 
you look at the services business and in terms of your TV+ content 
production have the movement restrictions impacted the content production 
efforts? And along the same path four years ago your premonition on 
services being a $50 billion business in 2020 came sooner than expected, I 
don't know if you want to make any such forecast four years out and how 
you think services revenue is going to be
. Then I have a follow
-
up for Luca.
 
Tim Cook
 
I'm sorry. I missed that second question because the audio didn't come 
through. But I think I got the gist of the first. And that is production has 
been affected for Apple TV+ as I think it has for most people. 
We are 
working to get restarted. I don't have a precise date yet when we will get it 
restarted, but there will be some impact because we shut down in the March 
time frame and are yet to really restart in a significant way particularly for 
those that are sh
ut in the LA area given the current status of the virus and 
those. And I'm sorry I missed your, the second part of your question.
 
Krish Sankar
 
Yes, Tim, I was trying to see, four years ago you made a great prediction 
that services is going to be $50 billio
n by 2020. I wanted to see if you have 
any update to the prediction four years down the road?
 
Tim Cook
 
We're not updating today. We feel good. We want to take the moment and 
feel good about achieving the doubling six months early. And we do have 
still hang
ing out there, as you know, the subscription number that we're 
shooting for later in the year at 600 million. So we do have that objective 
out there.
 
Krish Sankar
 
If I could just squeeze in one for Luca. With the strong sales in Mac given 
the 
shelter
-
in
-
place, do you think the back
-
to
-
school season got pulled in by 
a quarter or do you expect the momentum to still continue? Thank you very 
much.
 
Luca Maestri
 
As I said, when I was talking about providing some commentary for the 
September quarter, 
we expect all the non
-
iPhone product categories to have 
a very strong year
-
over
-
year performance. So we definitely, I mean, the 
back
-
to
-
school season is clearly this one and we are very excited not only 
for the Mac, but also for the iPad. We've got a fanta
stic lineup of products 
and we know that these products are incredibly relevant especially given the 
current circumstances. So we expect the performance that we've seen for 
Mac in the June quarter to continue.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you. Can we have the next que
stion, please?
 
Operator
 
Yes. From Cross Research we'll hear from Shannon Cross.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in 
China? I know the revenue was up 2% and I think Luca talked about record 
iPad, but just c
urious as to given their 5G [indiscernible] how you're seeing 
the market play out? And then I have a follow
-
up. Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Shannon, the growth that we 
--
 
we did see growth in Greater China for the 
quarter of 2%, currency affected China, a bit more
 
than in other places, it 
affected 400 basis points. And so in constant currency, we would have 
grown at 6%. As I had mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best
-
selling phone and has been number one in urban China and so we're very, 
very proud of th
at. iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work 
from home and distance learning as it was in other geographies and the Mac 
also grew strong double digit during the quarter. And services set a new 
June quarter record there. We also continue to see
 
extremely high new 
customer rates on Mac and iPad there, to give you a perspective, about 
three out of four customers that are buying the Mac are new in China and 
about two out of three that are buying the iPad are new. And so these are 
numbers that we're
 
super proud of.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Great. And then, can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring 
Mac Silicon in
-
house, then the benefits that you expect to see or you've seen 
from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business
? 
Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
Thanks. Yes, I mean, what we will end up 
--
 
what we'll end up with is a 
common architecture across all of our products, which gives us some 
interesting things that we can do in products that are 
--
 
that is sort of 
unleashes another round
 
of innovation. And so I don't want to say a lot 
about it, other than we are extremely excited about it, it's something that 
we've worked on quite a while to get to this point and we're looking forward 
to shipping the first Mac with Apple Silicon later in 
the year.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please.
 
Operator
 
That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Thanks a lot for taking my question guys. I have one and a follow
-
up as 
well. Fortunately, I guess, Tim
, if I think about the strength, you're seeing 
with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of where is this trend 
coming from? Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter or which is 
getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem because, clearly 
these growth 
rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and upcoming 
refresh cycle that we have?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think, Amit, it's a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE and some 
--
 
probably some pick up because of the economic stimulus 
that hit different 
countries at different points in time. And probably some of the reopening 
that took place across the quarter, particularly in May and June as Store 
started to reopen. And so it's a combination of all of those. And as you 
know, we've been
 
having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. 
And so when you combine the 
--
 
a strong cycle plus and iPhone SE launch, 
plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things 
that we're going in the right direction there
.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Perfect, that's helpful. And then I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with 
you. I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 
38% gross margins? What do you think of the levers to improve this as you 
go forward
, not really September quarter, but over the next one to two 
years? And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross 
margin starts to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower 
for the last couple of quarters now.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. Well, let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. We 
were at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount 
on a year
-
over
-
year basis. And really the big negative impact that we felt for 
several quarters now has been the
 
strength of the US dollar, so the foreign 
exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points on a year
-
over
-
year basis was 130 basis points. So obviously that is something to keep in 
mind.
 
And then, the other aspect; I think it's always important t
o keep in mind, 
Amit, is that we sell many different products. They have different margin 
profiles. And so sometimes a different mix can have an impact on the 
aggregate level of products gross margins and we are very pleased to see 
the performance of Mac, 
iPad and Wearables but obviously, it's a different 
mix. Going forward, the variables are always the same, is that the foreign 
exchange will continue to play an impact, the mix of products there, we're 
going to be selling, will have an impact as well. The c
ommodities market has 
been relatively benign and we'll see how that plays out over time. As you 
know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would 
say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the 
strength of t
he dollar and we plan to continue to make a good trade off 
decisions between revenue and units and margins.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
It will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.
 
Kyle McNealy
 
Hi, 
thanks a lot for the question. Our team in Asia recently, we did some 
survey work on smartphones in China. It showed that there is still a high 
proportion of the installed bases on 6, 7, 8 devices. I know you talked about 
the trade
-
in programs and promotio
ns that you've been doing there. I 
wonder if you can tell us whether there is anything else that you're doing to 
get these customers in your latest technology? What made those customers 
be looking for and how should we think about when an upgrade cycle mig
ht 
come on more strongly there in China? Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
Customers upgraded different at a different pace and I don't have in front of 
me the exact installed base data from China. But much like in other 
geographies, the upgrades have extended some, it ext
ended some during 
the depths if you will of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world, and 
probably to some degree is happening still at this point. The key things that 
we can do is keep innovating, deliver product that people can't imagine, 
going th
rough life about. And obviously keep rolling out these programs that 
makes the front
-
end purchase be much less, and this is things like the 
financing in the trade
-
in programs that you mentioned. And I do feel like 
those are going quite good in a number of 
geographies.
 
Kyle McNealy
 
Okay, great, thanks. And one more if I may. Congrats again on the strong 
iPad and Mac results, that's really impressive. I guess the obvious question 
is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pull
-
forward and 
what m
ight be the future upgrades in next few years? Anything else you can 
share on how you think about growth from here or whether there is a 
hangover period maybe after the back
-
to
-
school season or holiday season. 
That would be helpful. Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
The in
stalled base is growing and the new customer numbers that Luca went 
over in the aggregate are still very high in the close to 50% kind of range. 
And so, that to me, makes the 
--
 
bodes well for the future. There is clearly, 
as we had indicated, there is som
e amount of work from home and remote 
learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. They probably 
affect wearables and iPhone, the other direction. And 
--
 
but on Mac and 
iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay eng
aged with 
their work or stay engaged with their school work. And we believe we're 
going to have a strong back to school season. Sitting here today, it certainly 
looks like that.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Kyle.
 
Kyle McNealy
 
Great. Thanks very much.
 
Tejas
 
Gala
 
Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Cleveland Research's Ben Bollin.
 
Ben Bollin
 
Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping 
you could share a little bit about where you think channel inven
tory is? You 
talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and 
iPad. Interested, where you think inventory is across major product 
categories. And then I had a follow
-
up for Luca.
 
Tim Cook
 
We usually 
--
 
we've gotten away from talking 
about channel inventories. But 
to give you a perspective sitting here looking at it, on iPhone the inventory is 
slightly less than it was a year ago and that's I'm saying that at a quarter 
end point, so at the end of Q3. And obviously iPad and Mac are cons
trained 
and so both of those are less than they were in the year ago quarter.
 
Ben Bollin
 
Okay. And then, Luca, I'm interested, any color you could share about the 
impact COVID had on OpEx in the quarter, be it work from home, stipends, 
travel, other employ
ee support costs. And also how the company is thinking 
about the longer
-
term opportunity of employees working remotely maybe 
more permanently many considerations and how that could influence the 
future OpEx? Thanks.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Well, on the OpEx front, th
ere are being obviously certain things that have 
been affected in terms of cost reductions. Obviously, travel, it is a perfect 
example. The number of meetings that we have internally, some of those 
costs have been reduced. We've also invested heavily in in
itiatives for 
example, we're really trying to help during a very difficult circumstances. For 
example, we have had a program for example where we match our 
employee donations, we made donations directly as a company around the 
world to many institutions an
d governments. On a net basis, I would say 
probably the cost have outweighed the savings both during the March and 
the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. From an 
employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the U
nited States, 
in most 
--
 
the majority of our population will continue to work from home 
until the end of the year.
 
And then we'll see, I mean, we've taken an approach that we try to 
understand how the virus is evolving over time. We've taken a very cautious 
approach of both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. I 
think what you've seen with retail s
tores is that we have reopened in 
number of geographies around the world. We've reopened here in the United 
States. We've had to re
-
close some of the stores yet here in the United 
States, as the number of cases has gone up. And we will continue to track 
ho
w the virus is doing. And hopefully at some point, we're going to get to a 
point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. And so we will make those 
decisions as we get more information.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Opera
tor
 
That will be from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.
 
Jeriel Ong
 
Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. I'd like to focus on 
the gross margin expansion within the services line all
-
time record for the 
quarter. I'm just curious whether you thi
nk that will sustain, I understand 
within services is a pretty wide range of gross margins by business, and I'm 
wondering if that should continue to improve.
 
Tim Cook
 
Well, as you've seen, obviously, we've had a sequential expansion in gross 
margin for ser
vices. And that was driven primarily by mix as you said, right. 
We have a very broad portfolio and depending on which one of the services 
does better than we have an impact on Services gross margins. We like the 
Services business because it is 
--
 
it's a re
curring type of revenue and the 
margins are accretive to company margin. We did over 67% this quarter, 
but we want to offer very competitive services across the board and the 
same 
--
 
I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on 
products. What
 
matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do 
and provide great products and services to our customers. So the relative 
success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive to a 
certain extent with our margins are, that's the 
margins are a byproduct of 
our success in the marketplace.
 
Jeriel Ong
 
Got it, really appreciate that. And I wanted to ask question on the Wearables 
segment. It seems to me that you're categorizing the Wearables business as 
maybe being a little bit impact f
rom pandemic similar to the iPhones. And it's 
the first time that Wearables hasn't materially upsided and at least a while in 
recent memory. I guess the drivers of the Wearables being Watch and 
predominantly Watch and AirPods. What are your thoughts going 
forward on 
whether there is a little bit of pent
-
up demand perhaps that might resume 
ads that will get back to a more normalized environment?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think on the Watch in particular is like the iPhone more affected by store 
closures, because people 
--
 
some people want to try on the Watch and see 
what it looks like, look at different band choices and those sorts of things. 
And so I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. I was 
--
 
we 
did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter, we
 
were going to 
come out from the color that we gave you. So we knew things would 
decelerate because of the closures. So we will end up being, we're very 
pleased with how we did. But the store closures definitely affect the 
wearables and the iPhone.

ala
 
Thank you, Jeriel.
 
Jeriel Ong
 
Got it. Really appreciate that.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Yes. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
 
Jim Suva
 
Thank you very much. And I have two questions. I'll ask them at the same
 
time and it's one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, the coronavirus, your 
company has done a fantastic job at overcoming one of the hurdles. So 
congratulations to you. As you look forward, say to the Christmas holiday 
shopping season, and given the economic 
challenges around the world of 
virus, coronavirus and your product launches and things like that. Can you 
give me commentary maybe how this Christmas you're looking forward, to 
say, maybe some past cycles of Christmas? Because it just seems like it's a 
lit
tle bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming 
into this Christmas than may be some of the past years.
 
And then for Luca, I think you made a quick comment, Luca, that you 
mentioned something about a few weeks later, was Apple lik
e iPhone, iPhone 
chips or product launches or maybe expand upon that. I know things are 
more difficult, but I didn't quite keep the commentary, it was in your 
prepared comments, we'll go about a few weeks late that let's just have a 
quick little blood. Tha
nk you so much, gentlemen.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes, we take it one quarter at a time. And so, we'll give you color on the 
December quarter and October. Generally speaking, I think we need to see a 
vaccine or therapeutic or both. And there is some optimism around that
 
and 
in that particular timeframe. And so, we'll see, I don't have any information 
that is publicly available there. But I think that would boost consumer 
confidence quite a bit if it begins to happen and I think that any kind of 
consumer style company wou
ld benefit from that.
 
Luca Maestri
 
And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks that we launched a year ago, 
we launched the new iPhone in late September. So I was referring to the 
new product. And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will 
be 
a few weeks later than that.
 
Jim Suva
 
Great. Congratulations to you and your entire organization and teams. 
Thank you so much.
 
Tim Cook
 
Thanks so much.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Hi. Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the 
penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base? And have you 
seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Ca
rd users in terms of 
accelerating spend on more Apple products and services? Then I have a 
follow
-
on.
 
Tim Cook
 
We saw changes in consumer spending as the shutdowns occurred and the 
store closures occurred, we could see that across the Card. It affected the
 
categories that you would guess the most like travel and entertainment et 
cetera. But overall if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we're 
very happy with the number of people that have Apple Card. We believe 
based on what we've heard that it
's the fastest rollout in the history of credit 
cards and so we feel very good about that.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Okay. Thanks, Tim. And as a follow
-
up, now that Apple has Apple Silicon for 
Macs. Would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant silicon vendor 
or
 
is this going to be forever for Apple use?
 
Tim Cook
 
Well, I don't want to make a forever comment, but there are 
--
 
we are a 
product company and we love making the whole thing. And because if we 
can 
--
 
on the user experience in that way and with the goal o
f delighting the 
user. And that's the reason that we're doing the Apple Silicon is because we 
can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple Silicon that we 
couldn't achieve otherwise. And so that's how we look at it.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Thanks, Tim.

Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I 

ying safe and well.
 
Today Apple reports $58.3 billion in revenue, an all
-
time record for Services, 
and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was also a 
quarterly revenue record for Apple Retail powered by phenomenal growth in 
our onlin
e store. Amid the most challenging global environment in which 

the quarter.
 
But before we dive more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a 
bit on COVID
-
19. This is som
ething Apple has been contending with since 
January. And I think that how we have responded, what we have been 

business, and the enduring importance of our products in our custome


always in terms of the long term and to forge ahead when others may feel 
an instinct to pull back.
 
Before COVID
-
19 was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to 
be a
 
prolific and energetic period for Apple. And when the pandemic did 
strike, our teams not only succeeded in growing the business in introducing 

rose to the occasion in terms of meeti
ng our broader obligations to the 
communities in which we live and work.
 

leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices 

ur worldwide network of 
supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the 
Company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline 

every region arou
nd the world.
 
While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic 
Keyboard, MacBook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very 
well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with 
our suppliers to desig
n, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 
million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these 
every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the frontlines.
 
In a quarter where our Services teams achieved strong gr
owth, which Luca 
will dig into in a minute, and which speaks to the real durability of our 
Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID
-
19 front and center. 
As Apple News, reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated 
trusted information 
from reliable sources through a special COVID
-
19 
vertical.
 
We let customers skip payments without incurring interest on Apple Card for 
March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. We worked 
with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga to info
rm, entertain and give back 
through Apple TV and services like FaceTime and Messages set new all
-
time 
records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied on their devices 
to stay connected in a new reality.
 
In software, at the same time that our t
eams worked with great creativity 
and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first ever all online Worldwide 
Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same 
creativity and speed to put together our COVID
-
19 symptom checking 
websit
e and app in partnership with the CDC. As of today, the app has been 
installed nearly 2 million times and the web tool has received over 3 million 
unique visits. And just this month, to accelerate contact tracing, we are 
launching a joint effort with Googl
e to enable the use of Bluetooth 
technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of 
the virus with user privacy and security central to the design.
 
We paired these programmatic efforts with a broader strategy to get back 


efforts around the world to support global citizens as well as a new fund for 
Americans experiencing food insecurity as a result of the crisis. When you 
tally these things up and consider our ongoi
ng 2 to 1 match for employee 

diverse, and a great source of pride for the whole chain.
 

extension their commu
nities stay safe and well by modifying our operations 
where appropriate. This extends of course to our retail employees, they are 


ures.
 
During a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been 
gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain. While 
we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, 
suppliers and manufacturi
ng partners have been safely returning to work 
and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.
 
At this time of social distance, of shuttered school and gathering places, of 
delayed plans and new ways of socializing, we have seen signific
ant 
evidence that our products have taken a renewed importance for customers. 
Teachers and students around the world are relying on our technology to 
teach, learn, and stay connected with each other. We are in the process of 
deploying major orders of iPads
 
to school systems working to keep learning 
going strong at a distance, including tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada; 
Glasgow, Scotland and Puerto Rico, a 100,000 to the city of Los Angeles and 
350,000 to New York City, our largest educational iPad deplo
yment ever.
 

students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. These folks are keeping us 
all entertained and inspired as we stay at home. And to help them do it, we 
made Final Cut Pro X 
and Logic Pro X available for free for 90
-
days for 
everyone. And the reaction has been overwhelming, driving software 
downloads and usage to record levels.
 
And doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple 
Watch and other health fe
atures to communicate with patients and to treat 
them safely from a distance when necessary. With new FDA guidance on 
non
-
invasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple 
Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measur
ements and 
recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider 
contact and exposure. Many hospitals such as Geisinger Health System, NYU 
Langone Health, and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and 
iPhone to support communica
tion and video conferences between 
hospitalized patients and their care teams. This enables the care teams to 
keep a close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps 
to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protec
tive 
equipment.
 
Now, when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the 
ways COVID
-
19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, 
this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic, 
but I don't think I can
 
recall a quarter where I've been prouder of what we 
do or how we do it.
 
As I said at the outset, we achieved revenue of $58.3 billion and underneath 
that was product revenue of $45 billion. The performance of our product 
business had three very different 
phases during the March quarter. Based on 

confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high 
end of our expectations. In the next five weeks of the quarter, as CO
VID
-
19 
started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as 
demand for our products within China. This caused us to withdraw our 
revenue guidance in February. At that point, demand for our products 
outside of China was still strong a
nd in line with our expectations. During the 
last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social 
distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all 
our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13th, an
d many channel 
partner points of sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on 
demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.
 
Given the lack of visibility and uncertainly in the near term, we will not be 
issuing guidance for the coming 
quarter. Over the long term though, we 
have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business. 
Our global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. We have shown 
the consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challeng
es like 
those caused by COVID
-
19. We have continued to deliver innovative new 
products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross
-
section of 
customers, including the all
-
new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched 
technological capacity at an incr
edible value.
 
Our teams worldwide have tackled the complexities of this moment with 
unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to our customers. For a 
company whose business is innovation, there are real upsides in periodically 
having to figure out ho
w to do just about everything in a brand new way.
 
Our long
-
running investment in our Services strategy is succeeding. This 
business is growing and is a reflection of our enduring large and growing 
installed base. We expect to meet our longstanding goal of 
doubling our 
fiscal 2016 Services revenue in 2020. We have always run Apple for the long 
term. We entered this period with unmatched financial strain, a robust cash 
position and our best product pipeline ever.

to do everything we can do to help the global resp

customers learning, creating, sharing, and connecting so that life can remain 
as normal as it can during this challenging time.
 

 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.
 
It has been
 
a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last 
talked to you at the end of January. But, we could not be more proud of our 
Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and 
our partners throughout the value chain, an
d how resilient our business and 
financial performance has been during these challenging times.
 
So, the revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago, 
despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID
-
19 and a 
headwind of a 100 
basis points from foreign exchange. Products revenue 
was $45 billion, down 3%.
 
After a very strong January, our performance was impacted particularly 
during the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point
-
of
-
sale 
closures increase due to COVID
-
19 spreading around the world and affected 
our product sales. However, on a demand basis, our performance was 
stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory 
more than we did a year ago. Importantly, our installed base of active 
devices reached an all
-
time high in all of our geographic segments and all 
major product categories.
 
Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year
-
over
-
year 
growth of 17%. We set a new all
-
time revenue record of $13.3 billion with 
all
-
t
ime records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we 

 
Company gross margin was 38.4%, flat sequentially with cost savings and 
mix shift towards Services offset by the seasonal loss of levera
ge. Products 
gross margin was 30.3%, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially due to 
loss of leverage and unfavorable mix. This drop was more pronounced than 
under normal circumstances due to the COVID
-
19 impact I mentioned 
earlier.
 
Services gross margin w
as 65.4%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven 
by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.4%. This was 
lower than our 16.5% guidance due to onetime discreet items.
 
Net income was $11.2 billion and earnings per share with $2.55, up 4
%. 
Operating cash flow was very strong at $13.3 billion, an improvement of 
$2.2 billion over a year ago.
 
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.
 
iPhone revenue of $29 billion, declined 7% year
-
over
-
year as both iPhone 
supply and dem
and were affected by the impact of COVID
-
19 at some point 
during the quarter.
 
On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages 

adaptability of our global supply c
hain, as well as its ability to get people 
back to work safely when circumstances allow. Our operations team and 
manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore 
production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for
 
most of our product lines.
 
On the demand side, after very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of 
COVID
-
19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks, and then more 
broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter, when 
lockdowns
 
and point
-
of
-
sale closures became more widespread in many 
countries.
 
While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle towards the 
end of the quarter, which we attribute to the widespread point
-
of
-
sale 
closures, our active installed base of iP
hones has reached an all
-
time high. 
This speaks to the quality of our products and strength of our ecosystem. In 
fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates 
iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 
Pro Max 
combined.
 
Turning to Services. We set an all
-
time revenue record of $13.3 billion with 
strong performance across the board with all
-
time revenue records in the 
App Store, Apple Music, Video, cloud services, and our App Store search ad 
business. And
 
we also set a March quarter record for AppleCare. Our new 
services, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus and Apple Card 
continue to add users, content and features while contributing to overall 
Services growth.
 

way to accomplishing our goal of 

 
App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer 
demand for both in
-
app purchases and subscriptions. Our third
-
party 
subscription business grew 
across multiple categories and increased over 
30% year
-
over
-
year, reaching a new all
-
time high. Our first party 
subscription services also continued to perform very well. Apple Music and 
cloud services, both set all
-
time revenue record and AppleCare set a 
March 
quarter record. Paid subscriptions for all three of these services were up 
strong double
-
digits.
 
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the 
number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores 
reach
ed a new all
-
time high during the March quarter. In particular, the 
number of paid accounts increased double digits in all of our geographic 
segments. We now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the 
services on our platform, up 125 million from 
a year ago. On a sequential 
basis, paid subscriptions grew by over 35 million. This is the highest 

confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions 
before t
he end of calendar 2020.
 
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record 
with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year
-
over
-
year with strong double digit 
performance across all five geographic segments.
 
Our Wearables business is now the 
size of a Fortune 140 company, and 

category. For example, Apple Watch continues to expand its reach as over 
75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the
 
quarter were new to the product.
 

revenue was $4.4 billion. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a 
brand new iPad Pro that includes a first in class LiDAR scanner with som
e 
really exciting augmented reality applications; and MacBook Air with 

the strong customer interest for both products.
 
Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs an
d iPads around 
the world during the quarter were new to that product and the active 
installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all
-
time high. And the 
most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer 
satisfaction at 95% for iPad 
and 96% for Mac.
 
In the enterprise market businesses everywhere have been making the 

customers in this transition including an on

contactless payments. And as stores shif
t to become fulfillment centers for 
online orders, organizations are leveraging apps for remote shoppers and 
food delivery to reduce foot traffic.
 
In banking, where safety and securities are a top priority, one way to protect 
company and client information
 
is by providing corporate iOS devices to 
employees who use mobile phones daily as part of their jobs. As an 
example, Bank of America is purchasing tens of thousands of additional iOS 
devices for their workforce.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position.
 
First
, I want to note that liquidity has not been an issue for us during these 
highly unusual financial market conditions. We have an extraordinarily 
strong balance sheet, very deep access to capital markets, and unmatched 
free cash flow generation. We ended th
e quarter with $193 billion in cash 
plus marketable securities, total debt of $110 billion. And as a result, net 
cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned $22 billion to 
shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion throu
gh open 
market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares, and $3.4 billion in 
dividends and equivalents.

As Tim mentioned, given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, 
we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. However, based on 
what we have seen in April, and how we thin
k things might play out, I would 

facing.
 
From a foreign exchange standpoint, the U.S. dollar has appreciated recently 
against most currencies around the world. And as a result, we exp
ect our 
revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year
-
over
-
year basis. Our global supply chain is back, up and running. We are in a 
typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new 
products recently launched. Th
ese newly launched products, iPad Pro, 
MacBook Air, and iPhone SE have all received outstanding customer 
response, even during these extreme circumstances.
 
On iPhone and Wearables, we expect a year
-
over
-
year revenue performance 
to worsen in the June quarte
r relative to the March quarter; on iPad and 
Mac, we expect the year
-
over
-
year revenue performance to improve in the 
June quarter.
 
On Services, we are seeing two distinct trends. First, customers are actively 
engaging with our ecosystem and digital service
s, and we believe the very 
strong recent performance in the App Store, Video, Music, and cloud services 
will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, due to the overall 
reduced level of economic activity, due to the lockdowns around the world, 
service
s like AppleCare and advertising are being impacted. AppleCare is 
comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements with 
our customers, both of which have been obviously affected by store closures 
and reduced level of customer traffic. A
dvertising, which is comprised of 
third
-
party agreements, our App Store search ads, and Apple News ads has 
been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when 
businesses will reopen.
 
For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exc
hange, the mix 
within products, and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. 
Foreign exchange will have a 70 basis points impact sequentially and 130 
basis points impact year
-
over
-
year. Regarding product mix, keep in mind the 
commentary we pr
ovided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include 
cost savings and the mix shift towards services.
 
With regard to capital allocation, our approach remains unchanged. We 
continue to invest confidently in our future while also returning value to our 
shareholders. We are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of 
products and services ever while contributing over $350 billion to the U.S. 
economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over 
a five
-
year period.
 
We also
 
continue to believe that there is great value in our stock, and we are 
maintaining our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As 
a testament to the confidence we have in our business today and into the 
future, our Board has authorized $
50 billion for share repurchases in 
addition to the over $40 billion authorization remaining under the current 
share repurchase plan. Our Board has also authorized a 6% increase in our 
quarterly dividend and today declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per shar
e of 
common stock, payable on May 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of 
May 11, 2020.
 
Finally, and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term, as 

invest in the 
business and this remains our philosophy. We will continue to 
stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service 
pipeline, managing the business wisely, and taking care of our teams and 
believe we will come out from this stronger.

Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, 
may have the first question, please?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Yes. That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much for taking my question, and I hope everyone is well. 
Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. 
So, I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment, 
a geographic basis


follow
-
up. Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Sure, Shannon. If you look at 
--
 

happened in Ch
ina, we were having a really good January. The lockdown 
started there toward the end of January, as you know. February, we saw a 
steep decline in demand. We closed our stores in February. As the lockdown 
completed in mid
-
February, toward the second half of
 
February, we begin to 
open stores. We opened on a staggered basis that took about 30 days until 
mid
-
March. And from a demand point of view, we saw then an improvement 
in March over February. And if you look at, kind of where we are today, 

er improvement in April as compared to March. And so, 

 
If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first 
five weeks of the quarter. And we do believe that we were headed toward 
the sort of the top end of our expec
tations that we had talked to you about 
on the last call. The next five weeks were spent sort of reacting and getting 
the supply chain back up in full force and working through the sharp decline 
in China that I already talked about. The real thing for the 
rest of the world 
happened in March when the shelter
-
in
-
place orders went in and the work
-
from
-
home began. For those two, three weeks period, at the end of the 
quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand.
 
If you now step out into April and look at that, earl
y April started like the 


product. We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new 
produc
ts, a part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, 
and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is 
going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth 
lined up to work at home more
. In particular for as I think Luca shared, we 
believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year
-
over
-
year basis 

education or working remotely. So, complex answer to your questi
on, but 

 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you. That was helpful. Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about 

expenses. I know you mentioned some cost savings on the 


the macro challenges that you may be facing. Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. So, Shannon, as we said, we manage the Company for the long term, 
right? So, we know that the c
ore of the business, the core of the Company is 
innovation and product and services development. So, we will continue to 

so, we will continue to invest there. Obviously, we are awa
re of the 
environment and so, we will manage the SG&A portion of the company 
tightly. We are making new investments in the new services that we 
launched recently. As you know, we purchased the baseband activities from 
Intel. And obviously, we want to devel
op that technology because we 

to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like 
to manage the business wisely.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Shannon. Can w
e have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will be from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 


a
ppreciate it.
 
Tim Cook
 
Thank you very much for that.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from 
investing. And you as a company have largely maintained the product 
introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedente
d times and there 
are a lot of challenges associated with product development, during a time 
when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a 
lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development 
and intro
duction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? And I 
have a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 

everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, 
the iPad Pro with the 
Magic Keyboard, and the MacBook Air. And so, the 


-
at
-
home. In some 
areas of the Company, people maybe even more productive, in 
some other 

roles are. But, as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the 
environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that 
our customers want the p

important in these times.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Thank you, Tim. As a follow
-

Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands 
of customers. But, I was won
dering, would you consider using the strength 
of your balance sheet maybe a little differently, structure maybe deferred 
payments or things like that, or do you think that there could be other steps 
like bundling that you will consider versus what you alre
ady currently do? 
Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for 


-
focused on the affordab
ility 
point. The trade
-
in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as 
both something great for the environment, also something great from a way 
to get that entry price down. In terms of deferred payments, nothing to 
announce today. But, as yo
u know, having access to the card, at least in the 
United States, gives us more degrees of freedom. And that is not using our 
balance sheet. But, we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go 
with the card.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have t
he next question, please?
 
Operator
 

 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you for the question. I hope the whole team is staying healthy and 
safe. Tim, I want to start on a longer term question. Where do you see 
structural ch
anges on the back of this health crisis that might present 

thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality. But 

tivity coming out of 
the company. And then, I have a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 
I think, there are things from just a great reminder of how important our 

will get a lot closer to normal t
han they are today, obviously. I think many 
people are finding that they can learn remotely. And so, I suspect that trend 

remotely in some areas and in some jobs. And so, I think we have
 
significant 
solutions and products for all of those groups. On the health area, I gave 
some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the 

already doing that because we
 
viewed that that area was a huge opportunity 
for the Company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so, you will 

would say, it was already opened fairly wide.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Okay. And then, as a follow
-
up, the $50 billion share repurchase 
authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the 
last couple of years. So, just any context around the thought process of 
landing on $50 billion. And then, 
related to that, you have one of the 
strongest balance sheets in the world. Does the current environment change 
your thinking at all around M&A opportunities?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Let me answer that, Katy. First of all, on the buyback. As I said, in general, 
our a
pproach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several 

the authorization, right? And when you look at our actual results at the end 
of every quarter, you see how
 
much we actually do in terms of share 
repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still 


horization is 
over $90. And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you 
know that that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide 
an additional update a year from now. So, nothing really has changed there. 
And nothing ha

over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. 

gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side
, on the software side, on 
the services side. So, we will continue to do that. And so, also on the M&A 
front, nothing has changed.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
 
Am
it Daryanani
 
Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off on the 
channel inventory. I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel 
inventory look like in the March quarter, because it sounds like it may be 
below the historica
l ranges. And then, the discussion you had for June 
quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel 
building back inventory levels in that expectation.
 
Tim Cook
 

e 

unusual that we reduce in Q2. In fact, if you look back, generally speaking, 
in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories; during 
the second half of the
 
calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. 

this year as well. So, hopefully, that answers your question. And by the way, 
we ended in a comfortable position. You could 
conclude from that that we 
were within a target range.
 
Amit Daryanani
 

-
up. Tim, I was hoping you could 

strategy and perhaps need for som
e diversity, especially given everything in 
the Company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months, how 
do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain 
and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the tr
aditional 
fall products that they used to get from Apple?
 
Tim Cook
 
As you know, our supply chain is global. And so, our products are truly made 
everywhere. And I would focus on that versus focus on one element of the 
manufacturing process, which tends to g
et more visibility, which is the final 
assembly. We have some final assembly in the United States; we have final 

conclude that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took 
place this 

durable and resilient. And so, I feel good about where we are. That said, 

because if we view it a
s confidential and competitive information. And so, we 
will look at the 
--
 
as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we 
learned and what we should change.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 

from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank
 
Jeriel Ong
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. So, I want to focus 
my question on Services. The segment was solid in the quarter despite 
overall macro weakness. I can kind of see the logic behind it
 
being strong 
despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, 
do you think that sustains or at some point does the macro impacts 
worldwide impact the Services line?
 
Luca Maestri
 

t give a lot of specifics about 

distinct trends in our services business overall. Our ecosystem is very 
strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double 
dig
its, the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so, we 
expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that 
we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of 
course, our video business, our m
usic business, cloud services. So, we 
expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.
 
Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, 
there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during 
the June qu
arter. One of them is AppleCare. AppleCare is essentially 
comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that 
we signed with our customers when they purchase our devices. Both these 
businesses have been affected obviously by the store
 
closures. And not only 
our retail stores, but also our partners points of sale, and obviously, the 
reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures. 
Right? And we do expect AppleCare to be affected during the during the 
June qua
rter.
 
The other business, which we think is going to be impacted by the overall 
economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is 
advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, 
on Apple News, and the third
 
party agreements that we have on the 
advertising front. So, these are two things that during the June quarter will 
create a headwind for the Services business.
 
Jeriel Ong
 
Got it. I appreciate that. My second question is about the overall purchasing 
decisi
ons the consumers are making. So far, through April, have you seen 
increased perhaps downtick across your product line? So for example, 
somebody might have shift maybe toward the lower end of the storage mix 
of certain products. And do you expect that goin
g forward, as unemployment 

 
Tim Cook
 

response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone. But it appears 
that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form 
factor with the latest technology, or comi
ng over from it from Android. So, 
those are the two principal kind of segments versus somebody buying down, 

--
 
we launched the iPad Pro in the 
midst of all of this and the reception there has also been incredibly
 
good. 


 
Tejas Gala
 
Thanks, Jeriel. Can we have the next question, please.

Chatterjee.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If I can just start with a question on kind 


e 
you seen relative to online activity, and how much of this recovery is being 
driven online? Any thoughts on that, please?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes. What we saw in China for the full quarter 
--
 


your question. We saw 
strong results in iPad and in Wearables, and in Services. And if you look up 
underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January, and then a 
significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter
-
in
-
place orders and 
the lockdowns we
nt into effect in China and the stores closed. And then, in 



 
To your question about
 
store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where 
it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. There 
has been, however, more move to online. And as I mentioned earlier in my 

l had a quarterly record for us 

-
week 
period around the world. And ex China 
--
 
and then China was closed prior to 

a 
phenomenal quarter, and that included in China, but it was also other 

permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far, because I think people like 
to be out and about. They just know 
that now is not the time to do that.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
If I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand 

are expecting any change in terms of the geographic
 
mix of where the 
demand comes from relative to typically what do you see for other iPhones 
from the line up on, just giving the lower price point?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think, it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better 
in areas where the m

plays out. And I expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. 

a very affordable package. And I think 
--
 
and it


 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our last question today will be from Chris Caso with Raymond 
James.
 
Chris Caso
 
Yes. Thank you. I 
wanted to follow up with another question on iPhone SE 
and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone 
strategy. And I guess, coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the 
decision to bring that at a lower price point. What
 
does that tell us with 
respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? Is this helping to 
add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? And if so, what does 
that imply for gross margins?
 
Tim Cook
 

ing the best product at a good price. 
And that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did 


give people 
the best deal that we can while making the best product.
 
Chris Caso
 
Okay. As a follow
-
up 
--
 
the follow
-
up question is on commodity pricing. And 
I think, you had expected to see some commodity price declines through the 
March quarter. If you cou
ld talk about what you expect, as you go through 
the year, perhaps in this new environment, and again, whether that turns 
into a challenge or a headwind for gross margins as you go into the second 
half?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes. For March, Chris, we saw NAND pricing i
ncrease slightly while DRAM 
and displays and the other commodities declined. For the June quarter, we 
would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, 
while displays and most other commodity prices we expect to decline.

Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we're 
pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer
 
demand 
and business performance than we anticipated just 90 days ago and include 
several encouraging signs.
 
Revenue of $42.4 billion was near the high end of our guidance range and 
gross margin of 38% was at the top of our guidance range. We achieved 
thes
e results while reducing channel inventory by about $3.6 billion, 
significantly more than the $2 billion inventory reduction we had expected. 
So our sell
-
through was markedly greater than our sell
-
in.
 
iPhone accounted for the vast majority of the channel i
nventory reduction. 
iPhone unit sell
-
through was down just 8% year on year, an even greater 
improvement over the March quarter than we predicted, and we expect the 
September quarter sell
-
through comparison to improve further. We feel 
good about our channel
 
inventory levels and believe they position us well for 
the months ahead.
 
We had a very successful global launch of iPhone SE, and demand 
outstripped supply throughout the quarter. We brought on additional 
capacity and were able to achieve supply/demand ba
lance as we entered the 
September quarter. At its launch, we said that the addition of the iPhone SE 
to the iPhone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of 
customers who love a four
-
inch phone and to attract even more customers 
into our e
cosystem.
 
In both cases, that strategy is working. Our initial sales data tells us that the 
iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets, and the 
percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers who are new to iPhone is 
greater than we've se
en in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones 
launched in the last several years.
 
Overall, we added millions of first
-
time smartphone buyers in the June 
quarter, and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly 
iPhone sales we've e
ver measured. In absolute terms, our year
-
to
-
date 
iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine
-
month 
period, and our active installed base of iPhones is up strong double
-
digits 
year over year.
 
We saw tremendous performance from our Ser
vices businesses, which grew 
19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion. The growth was broad
-
based, 
with App Store revenue up 37% to a new all
-
time high, in addition to strong 
increases in Music, iCloud, and AppleCare. In the last 12 months, our 
Services 
revenue is up almost $4 billion year on year to $23.1 billion, and 
we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year. Most of our 
terrific Services performance during the quarter was fueled by our active 
installed base of devices, with install
ed base
-
related purchases of $10.3 
billion accelerating to 29% growth year on year.
 
We had our best iPad compare in 10 quarters, with revenue growing 7% 
thanks to the rollout of the 9.7
-
inch iPad Pro. We're proud to have the most 
exciting lineup of tablets
 
and accessories in the world and exceptionally high 
customer satisfaction and engagement. Our surveys also show that about 
half of iPad Pro purchases are buying them for work. iPad Pro is the ultimate 
upgrade for existing iPad users and the ultimate repla
cement device for 
customers switching from PC notebooks.
 
Apple Watch continues to be the best
-
selling smartwatch in the world. And 
just this month, J.D. Power ranked it highest in customer satisfaction among 
all smartwatches. With watchOS 3 coming this fal
l, customers will be able to 
update their Apple Watches with an enhanced user interface, significantly 
improved performance and all
-
new fitness and health capabilities, including 
activity sharing. We're just getting started with the Apple Watch, and we 
loo
k forward to even more exciting announcements in this space.
 
On a personal note, during the past quarter I visited China and India, and I 
am very encouraged about our growth prospects in those countries. We 
remain very optimistic about the long
-
term opport
unities in Greater China 
and we continue to invest there. We opened our 41st Greater China retail 
store during the quarter, and we also made a $1 billion investment in Didi 
Chuxing.
 
Switchers and first
-
time smartphone buyers represented the lion's share of
 
our iPhone sales in the quarter, and our installed base of iPhones in China 
has grown by 34% over the last year alone. According to China Mobile, there 
are more iPhones on their network than any other brand, with iPhone users 
ranking first in terms of cus
tomer loyalty, data usage and ARPU. By far, the 
largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction was in Greater 
China, so our underlying business there is stronger than our results imply.
 
We face some challenges in Greater China, as the economic e
nvironment has 
slowed down since the beginning of the year. This is reflected in consumer 
confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% 
relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year. Hong Kong's tourism and 
retail busin
esses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger 
Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies.
 
Combining this backdrop with the tough comparison to last year, when 
revenue grew 112%, and the channel inventory reduction this year, we'
re 
reporting a decline in revenue in the June quarter. But to keep things in 
perspective, when we look back on our accomplishments in this segment 
over the last couple of years, they are truly remarkable. In the first three 
quarters of this fiscal year, ou
r total revenue from Greater China was almost 
$40 billion, up 55% from the same timeframe just two years ago, while 
iPhone units were up 47%.
 
India is now one of our fastest growing markets. In the first three quarters 
of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales
 
in India were up 51% year on year. We 
just announced a first of its kind design and development accelerator to 
support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS, and we 
opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development. We'r
e 
looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road, and we see 
huge potential for that vibrant country.
 
As we look forward to the fall, we are thrilled by customers' response to the 
software and services we previewed at our Worldwide Develop
ers 
Conference last month. This was our biggest WWDC ever. And for the first 
time, we have four innovative Apple platforms for our developers' apps, iOS, 
macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. In fact, iOS 10 will be the biggest release ever 
for iOS.
 
The momentum of al
l four platforms shows the strong relationship Apple 
enjoys with customers throughout their day and wherever they go, whether 
it's at home, in their car, at work, or everywhere in between. The Apple 
ecosystem is thriving and growing, and our new OS release
s this fall will 
take these great experiences to a new level.
 
Customers can look forward to more expressive ways to communicate with 
messages now with its own App Store, allowing users to create and share 
content, make payments, add stickers and more, all 
without leaving 
messages, which is now one of the largest messaging services in the world. 
Customers can also look forward to a broader and more intelligent role for 
Siri, which will work with your favorite apps from the App Store, so you can 
ask Siri to b
ook a ride with your favorite ride sharing app or send money to 
someone with Square.
 
There are also beautifully redesigned apps for music, maps and news, 
significant enhancements to HomeKit, CarPlay, and the Health app, building 
on our strategy to give use
rs a seamless experience in all aspects of their 
lives. There's also a major update with macOS Sierra, with new features like 
Siri and Apple Pay that make the Mac smarter and more helpful than ever, 
and even stronger continuity features across all the Appl
e devices.
 
These experiences become more powerful and intuitive as we continue our 
long history of enriching our products through advanced artificial 
intelligence. We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best 
enhance the customer experience. Fo
r example, machine learning enables 
Siri to understand words as well as the intent behind them. That means Siri 
does a better job understanding and even predicting what you want, then 
delivering the right responses to requests. To make Siri an even smarter
 
assistant, we're opening the service to developers, and this fall Siri will be 
available across our entire product line.
 
We're also using machine learning in many other ways across our products 
and services, including recommending songs, apps, and news. Machine 
learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos, predicting word 
choice while typing in messages and m
ail, and providing context awareness 
in maps for better directions. Deep learning within our products even 
enables them to recognize usage patterns and improve their own battery 
life. And most importantly, we deliver these intelligent services while 
protec
ting users' privacy. Most of the AI processing takes place on the 
device rather than being sent to the cloud. And starting this fall, we'll be 
using sophisticated technology called differential privacy, enhancing our 
ability to deliver the kinds of service
s we dream of and customers love 
without compromising on the individual privacy our customers have come to 
expect from us.
 
This fall we'll also bring Apple Pay to Safari so users can easily make secure 
and private purchases when shopping on participating w
ebsites. Tens of 
millions of users around the world are enjoying Apple Pay today at stores 
and in app, with estimated monthly active users up more than 450% year on 
year last month.
 
Leading financial partners tell us that three out of four contactless paym
ents 
in the U.S. are made with Apple Pay. This is amazing. There are more than 
11 million contactless
-
ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is 
available today, including 3 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the 
United States. With the 
launch of France, Switzerland, and Hong Kong this 
month, Apple Pay is now live in nine markets, including six of our top 10. 
Adoption outside the U.S. has been explosive, with over half of transaction 
volume now coming from non
-
U.S. markets.
 
With our lates
t OS releases, the unparalleled continuity across Apple devices 
will become even more powerful. For example, macOS Sierra will sense 
other devices and use secure protocols to communicate. With an 
authenticated Apple Watch, I can auto
-
unlock my Mac when I o
pen it 
without typing a password. With Universal Clipboard, I can copy and paste 
text, images, and even video between my iOS devices and my Mac. And I 
can automatically access the files on my Mac desktop and documents folder 
from another Mac, iOS device, o
r even a PC.
 
Innovations like these are the kinds of things that only Apple can do. We 
have an incredible lineup of products in our pipeline, and I'm very bullish 
about our long
-
term opportunity.
 
Now I'd like to hand it over to Luca to share more details w
ith you on the 
June quarter.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter 
was $42.4 billion, near the high end of our guidance range, compared to 
$49.6 billion in the year
-
ago quarter. Customer demand fo
r our products and 
services was stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the 
quarter. As Tim mentioned, we reduced overall channel inventories by 
roughly $3.6 billion.
 
On a geographic basis, our revenue grew strongly in Japan to a new June 
quar
ter record, and we experienced healthy growth in a number of other 
important markets, including Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Canada.
 
Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range. Operating margin 
was 23.9% of revenue, and net income was $7.
8 billion. Diluted earnings 
per share were $1.42, and cash flow from operations was strong at $10.6 
billion.
 
For details by product, I will start with the iPhone. We sold 40.4 million 
iPhones in the quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by over 4 mill
ion 
units compared to about 0.5 million units a year ago, so sell
-
through was 
down by 8%. We exited the quarter near the low end of our five
-
week to 
seven
-
week target range for channel inventory. The rollout of our new entry
-
level iPhone SE concurrent with
 
the channel reduction of more than 4 million 
higher
-
end iPhones resulted in a lower than usual iPhone ASP of $595. 
Therefore, we expect ASPs to improve this quarter.
 
We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets, with sales in Russia 
more than doubl
ing year over year, and double
-
digit growth in many other 
key countries, including Japan, Turkey, Brazil, India, Canada, and Sweden.
 
iPhone continues to show great momentum in business markets. A recent 
survey by 451 Research found that among U.S. corporat
e buyers planning to 
purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase 
iPhones. This is the highest corporate purchase intent ever measured by the 
survey for the September quarter.
 
Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, 
an increase of 19% 
over the June quarter last year. We set a new record for customers 
transacting on our iTunes Stores. And among our customers who purchase 
apps and content, the average amount spent per customer was the highest 
that we've ever measured. T
he App Store's growth rate has now accelerated 
for four consecutive quarters, reaching 37% in Q3. The App Store is 
overwhelmingly the preferred destination for both customers and 
developers. According to App Annie, we generated 100% more global 
revenue tha
n Google Play in the June quarter, widening our lead from the 
March
 
quarter.
 
Because of this continued growth, for the first nine months of our fiscal year, 
Services increased from 8% of our total revenue a year ago to 11% this 
year, and it represents an e
ven higher percentage of our profitability.
 
Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.3 million Macs compared to 4.8 
million last year. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales 
across the industry, with IDC estimating a 4% global contr
action. In addition 
to the overall market slowdown, we faced a very difficult compare to the 
year
-
ago quarter, when we introduced a new MacBook Pro and a new iMac. 
Despite these challenges, Mac continues to gain a high percentage of new 
customers, and our 
Mac installed base has grown to a new all
-
time high at 
the end of the June quarter. We ended the quarter below our four
-
week to 
five
-
week target range for Mac channel inventory.
 
Now turning to iPad, revenue grew 7%. iPad ASP was $490 compared to 
$415 in th
e year
-
ago quarter, with the increase driven by iPad Pro, and we 
sold 10 million iPads compared to 10.9 million in the year
-
ago quarter. We 
also reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units and exited the 
quarter within our five
-
week to seven
-
week targ
et range.
 
In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be 
highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics. 
Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the overall U.S. 
tablet market in the June qua
rter and has 84% share of tablets priced above 
$200. And in May, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction 
rate for iPad mini and a 95% rate for iPad Air. Among U.S. consumers 
planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 63% plan to 
pu
rchase an iPad, almost four times the purchase intention rate of the next 
highest brand measured, with iPad Pro the top choice for planned purchases. 
Corporate buyers report a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase 
intent of 71% for the September qu
arter.
 
One recent example of iPad business adoption is Sberbank, Russia's largest 
bank, which is adding 22,000 iPads to more than 10,000 purchased last year 
to deploy corporate mobility solutions across the organization and enable its 
consultants to serve 
customers in a more engaging and more efficient way.
 
More broadly, we're making great progress with our enterprise initiatives 
and we see strong growth opportunities ahead of us. In May, we announced 
a global strategic partnership with SAP to reimagine bus
iness processes with 
native iOS apps. SAP is the world's largest enterprise software provider, with 
more than 130 million potential users among its 300,000 global customers. 
In fact, it's estimated that 76% of global business transactions touch an SAP 
syst
em. Our partnership will deliver an SDK to fast
-
track iOS projects for 
SAP environments, an iOS academy to enable the 2.5 million SAP developers 
around the world to build great native iOS apps, and a portfolio of industry
-
specific apps to accelerate mobile
 
transformation in the enterprise.
 
Last month, we announced the first three solutions from our Cisco 
partnership, two that will dramatically improve the network performance of 
iOS traffic running on Cisco networks, and one that will bring the desk phone 
to
 
the 21st century by integrating iPhone Wi
-
Fi calling into Cisco Spark.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $231.5 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decrease of $1.4 
billion. $214.8 billion of this cash, o
r 93% of the total, was outside the 
United States.
 
We issued a total $2.4 billion of debt in Taiwan and in Australia, while 
retiring $2.5 billion in U.S. debt, leaving us with $72 billion in term debt at 
the end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from l
ast quarter.
 
We returned a total of over $13 billion to investors during the June quarter 
as follows. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalent. We spent $4 
billion on repurchases of 41.2 million Apple shares through open
-
market 
transactions. And we
 
launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in initial 
delivery and retirement of 48.2 million shares.
 
We also completed our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring 
an additional 8.7 million shares. We've now completed almost $177 billion of 
our
 
current $250 billion capital return program, including $127 billion in 
share repurchases. During the quarter, we also spent $1 billion on a minority 
investment in Didi Chuxing in China, completed three acquisitions and 
incurred $4.2 billion in capital exp
enditures.
 
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our 
outlook, which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$45.5 billion and $47.5 bil
lion. We expect gross margin to be between 
37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.050 billion and $6.150 
billion. We expect OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate 
to be about 25.5%.
 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared
 
a cash dividend of $0.57 per 
share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2016 to shareholders of 
record as of August 8, 2016.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit 
yourself to one one

part 
question and one follow

up. Operator, may we have the first question, 
please?
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
 
Shannon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
Thank yo
u very much for the question. Tim, can you talk a little bit about 
your thoughts on investments? You made the Didi investment this quarter. 
Obviously, you continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw I guess 
you invested in buying some of Carpool K
araoke. I'm just curious as to how 
you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more 
of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall 
capital allocation.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Shannon, we
 
obviously invest a ton of capital in our business itself to 
support research and development and the production of our products. And 
that's the main source of our capital. However, we're constantly looking on 
the outside for great talent and great intelle
ctual property. And we have 
been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so, and we 
continue to do that. And we think we've made some really great choices 
there.
 
In terms of the investment in Didi, it was an unusual investment in that, as 
you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these, but we have 
done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days. We invested in 
Akamai and a few other companies. So it wasn't the first.
 
From a Didi point of view, we see that as, one, a g
reat financial investment. 
Two, we think that there are some strategic things that the companies can 
do together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the 
business and the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know, and 
Didi ha
s an incredible team there. And so that's the rationale for why we did 
that. Would we do more investments? Yes, but it's not something that you'll 
see a whole string of from us. But we will constantly look for things that are 
smart to do.

Cross Research LLC
 
Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow
-
up for Luca. If you could, talk a 
little bit about the gross margin puts and takes for guidance, 37% to 38%. 
How are you thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products 
and that 
just as you look to how you guided gross margin?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes, Shannon. Let me correct you. It's 37.5% to 38%...
 
Shannon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
Sorry. I had that written down, but I said the wrong thing.
 
Luca Maestri

...for the September quarter. So essentially, we're guiding GM flat to slightly 
down sequentially. On the positive side, we're going to have leverage 
because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect 
to have positive mix as we get i
nto the September quarter, and these 
positives being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, 
which are typical at this time of the year for us.

Great, thank you very much. Regarding your revenue guidance for 
September, it's up about 10% sequentially, which is clearly at the high end 
historically. So what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone 
model? Is that affecting this? You mentione
d that 451 Research is finding 
business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the 
lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 
2008. You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low. So 
it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment. So where is the 
strength coming from in the September quarter?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Steve, we're not going to get into products or product transition. However, 
we've taken what we've le
arned from last quarter, and we did see a number 
of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw 
double
-
digit growth in during the quarter, from Japan to Brazil to India, 
some even stronger numbers than that in Russia. So there'
s a number of 
countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective.
 
We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest ever 
recorded. And the number of switchers through the nine months are the 
highest absolute numbers that we've 
ever had. And so when we look at that 
and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, 
and we think Services will continue to grow very briskly. We've made our 
best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 bill
ion to 
$47.5 billion.

Okay, fair enough. And as a follow
-
up, I wanted to ask you about your 
platform strategy. You talk about the four operating systems essentially as 
platforms, which I agree with. And it's just i
nteresting to me because Apple 
has such a control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet 
you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for 
platforms. And I think that's reflected in WWDC, as you pointed out, opening 
up API
s and so forth on messaging.
 
And you made the case there for apps versus messaging and the anti
-
bot 
argument. I'm just curious. Is that the way 

 
am I characterizing this 
roughly correctly in terms about how you think about the business? And how 
are you ma
naging that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated 
somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform 
where the value is created externally?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
We think to have a great platform you have 
to have a really healthy 
ecosystem. And so we're really proud of the developer community and the 
fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than 
other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so 
we want 
to do everything that we can do to continue building that. We now 
have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days 
on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service 
because there are so many out there. And so th
at's what we're doing.
 
The TV, and you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our 
users a seamless experience across all the different things that they do in 
their lives. And so that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why 
we're putting a huge investment in the home, making 

 
really bringing home 
automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. It's the 
reason for Apple TV and what we're doing in the living room. And so all 
these things, all these things toget
her are all about the user experience and 
making people's daily lives better.

Thank you. Luca, as it relates to gross margin, the guidance today is very 
similar to what you've provided over the last five years in terms of gross 
margin guidance in September versus June. A
nd the variances that you 
walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the 
dynamics that you see in any September quarter. But there's an added 
factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million units of high
-
ASP, high
-
margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June 
quarter. So I guess I'd just push back and ask why gross margin guidance 
wouldn't be even better? Is it the more balanced NAND environment that 
Tim spoke to, or is there something else impacting 
the guidance?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level. Of course, there are 
degrees of positive impact. We for example on the mix front, every cycle is 
slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly ha
s an impact on 
gross margins. And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step 
back for a second and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the 
U.S. dollar has strengthened. And as you know, we work with our hedging 
program where we get
 
protection from FX fluctuations in the short term. 
When these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new 
hedging contracts at spot rates.
 
And so versus September of 2014, for example, the U.S. dollar has now 
strengthened on average again
st international currencies by about 15%. And 
I think we need to accept that now we're living in this stronger U.S. dollar 
environment. We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing 
side, and obviously with hedges. But we need to deal with 
this situation, and 
that's where we are right now. We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX 
environment I think says a lot about all the work that we've done on the 
cost side to get there. Just to give you a sense, on a year
-
over
-
year basis, 
when I look 
at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis 
points on our margins.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Okay, thank you. And, Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade 
rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over t
he next quarter or the 
next year? Somebody mentioned that U.S. carriers have reported really 
weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone, but across their installed 
base. The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next 
iPhone cycle.
 
And so those data points would lead investors to believe that 
the upgrade rate will be low, but curious if you have a different view. Thank 
you.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I don't want to talk about phones that aren't announced. And so that aside, 
what we have seen in the past tense or current tense on the upgrade rate is 
that the iPhone upgrade rate for the iPhone 6S is very similar to the iPhone 
5S. And I guess in retrospect, maybe that was a predictable thing, although 
we didn't predict it in the
 
beginning. It took us a little time to realize that. 
The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that, and so it likely accelerated 
upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those. And so 
what the future holds, we'll see.
 
But I'm very opti
mistic about the future because I see so many signs that 
are positive. I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a 
switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the smartphone itself, led by 
iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and
 
important to people's lives. 
It's becoming essential. And all of the things that are coming both in the fall, 
the things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10, hopefully 
you're running by now with the beta, those and other things make it even 
more instrumental. And AI even makes it even more and more. As the 
phone becomes more and more your assistant, it's one of those that you're 
not going to leave without it. And so I see all of those things as vectors that 
are incredibly positive.
 
I also rea
lly like what I've seen with the iPhone SE and the fact that it's 
opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely 
convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but 
wanted to stay with iPhone, and so they were 
waiting for the iPhone SE. And 
so I see lots of positive things, and so that's how I look at it.

We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Toni 
Sacconaghi

Bernstein Research
 
Yes, thank you. You commented about the significant inventory drawdown in 
the quarter, $3.6 billion on the revenue side. So sell
-
through was $46 billion 
effectively, over 4 million iPhones, suggesting that sell
-
through iPhon
e sales 
were 45 million.
 
When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question 
of a previous question, which is in light of the true sell
-
through rate, which 
seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in Q3, likely some 
contributi
on and elasticity from the SE, when I look at Q4, it looks like you're 
guiding for iPhone unit on a sell
-
through basis to be flat or potentially down 
and for total company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the 
seasonality we see in Q4.
 
So I gue
ss my question is, are you expecting any drawdowns in channel 
inventory in fiscal Q4? Are my inferences around sell
-
through rate incorrect? 
Or given the business momentum that you spoke about in response to an 
earlier question and the hopefulness that you 
expressed in your prepared 
remarks, Tim, I'm actually surprised that the guidance isn't a bit stronger on 
the top line.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Toni, let me take it. Starting with your comments on the June quarter, I just 
want to point out that when we 
talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory 
reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone. iPhone is the vast majority 
of that, but we did reduce channel inventory on all other products as well. 
So that probably leads you to different conclusions to th
e math that you 
have just expressed.
 
On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone 
units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell
-
through 
adjustments that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in
 
line with what 
we've seen in the past. As you know, we do not provide guidance for 
channel inventory. But I would say, in general, I think it's important to keep 
in mind that if we look around the world, we do see a lot of positive signs, 
but we also know
 
that the macroeconomic environment is slowing down in a 
number of places around the world. And that needs to be taken into account 
in our guidance.
 
Toni Sacconaghi 
-
 
Bernstein Research
 
Okay. Luca, I did understand the $3.6 billion, but you said over 4 mil
lion 
iPhones were drawn down. I added that to the 40.4 million, so that would 
suggest close to 45 million on a sell
-
through basis. So that was the basis for 
my observation.
 
I was wondering if I could direct one at Tim. You talked about the upgrade 
cycle an
d how it elongated relative to the iPhone 6 and that it's similar to 
what you saw with the iPhone 5S. And my belief is that one of the bigger 
longer
-
term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just 
structurally elongate over time, particula
rly as your installed base of 
customers becomes less affluent and more international.
 
So I guess my question is, you have a mechanism, which is the Apple 
Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and 
puts people on buying the phone
 
as a service. And so I'd welcome any 
comments on how that program is doing. And then just more broadly, is 
Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its 
products on a monthly type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled 
fash
ion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a 
transactional revenue model?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers and 
new to smartphone. And so if you take it in reverse o
rder for a minute and 
look at a new smartphone, smartphone penetration right now around the 
world at the end of December was 42%. And so there's quite a bit of room 
there. It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets, but we have 
done 

 
we've had
 
reasonable business success in several emerging markets. 
And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter 
into them humbly.
 
On the switcher side, we really like what we're seeing. And we think that 
from a user point of view, as 
the smartphone itself becomes more and more 
essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about 
before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and 
at work and so forth, we think people will put more and
 
more focus on what 
they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer 
experience. A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives I 
think becomes more important and I think that really plays to our 
advantage. I a
lso think that the deployment of AI technology is something 
that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience, and so I like 
that.
 
From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A 
plus is that more and more people have
 
already joined upgrade programs. 
Some of these programs, like the one that you referenced that we've done, 
replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind 
of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year
. 
Others have an 18
-
month clock. Some have a 24
-
month clock, and there are 
even some that have a 30
-
month clock. And so there's various time 
schedules there. And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people 
on those programs than ever before beca
use they just started. It really got 
underway in a big way last year, in a smaller way two years ago. And so 
we'll see more of those this coming fall.
 
The minus side is that the bifurcation of the smartphone from the service 
itself has a plus and a minus i
nto it. The subsidy, the lack of that 

 
and this 
is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world, some of that can 
be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. 
They come back in and they pay less for the service but the
y pay more for 
their smartphone. And so there's lots of pluses and minuses on this. But 
overall, as I look at this for Apple, and this is not a statement on the 
industry itself, but for Apple, I'm very optimistic.

Thank you. Tim, as you mentioned, you traveled to China during the

a and highlighted 
the Didi investment, there are some of the key services for Apple like iBooks

Yes, for books and movies, we currently have those stores off, as you

th
at we had them operational, which was several months, the revenue was 
less than $1 million. And so it's not a revenue

of view, this is a service we want to provide our customers. And so we're 
working very closely with the appr

hose two. And so what 
we have to do and what we're doing is innovating like crazy and delivering 
the best smartphone to our customers there. And if we do a really great job

Good afternoon. Tim, you gave some nice data points around Apple Pay. Can 
you remind us? Is this a business that
 
ultimately impacts the Services line in 
any measurable way, or is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones?
 
And separately, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point 
that the augmented reality [AR] theme has had with this whole Pokémon 
p
henomenon, how does it impact how you think about the future? I assume 
you think about it. I'm just curious what goes on in your mind when you see 
all that. Thanks.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
On the Apple Pay side, the revenues from Apple Pay are in
 
the Services line. 
The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small. And so for today, 
Apple Pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they 
can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way.
 
In terms of AR and the Pokémon phen
omenon, it's incredible what has 
happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative 
apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being 
able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. 
A
nd just a certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of 
the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But I'm 
sure that they will over time.
 
It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. And we 
have
 
been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the 
long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great 
commercial opportunity. And so we're investing, and the number one thing 
is to make sure our products work well with o
ther developers' products like 
Pokémon. And so that's the reason why you see so many iPhones out in the 
wild right now chasing Pokémons.

we'll 
see whether it's the next platform. But regardless, it will be huge.

Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to follow up, Tim, if I could, 
related to the R&D pace of growth, clearly a lot of momentum there over the 
last couple years. But we're just trying to figure out how much of that is 
dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next? Can you 
give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI 
coming back to them from the R&D perspective? And a corollary to that, is it 
really restricted just to products an
d services currently, or can we see more 
of a cloud services apparatus evolve over time where you do more and more 
in the enterprise just given the core trips with SAP and Cisco and IBM?
 
And then my follow
-
up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone. We keep
 
getting a lot of questions around iPhone SE in terms of how cannibalistic 
could it be to the core iPhone franchise. Are you seeing any moderation in 
terms of the ASP pressures here?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
On R&D growth, we do continue to 
invest significantly in R&D. The growth 
rates are still large on a year
-
over
-
year basis, and Luca can share the exact 
ones. But I think the recent quarter was in the mid
-
20% for R&D. The 
balance of the company we're managing more flattish from a year
-
over
-
year 
point of view. The products that are in R&D, there is quite a bit of 
investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping 
or derivations of what is currently shipping. And so I don't want to talk about 
the exact split of it. B
ut you can look at the growth rate and conclude that 
there's a lot of stuff that we're doing beyond the current products.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Mark, on the ASP question, I talked about the $595 in Q3. It's down $65 on 
a year
-
over
-
year basis. Keep in 
mind, about $20 of that $65 is foreign 
exchange. So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no 
iPhone SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do an at least a partial 
channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. And then the 
other 
element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of 
channel inventory on the high end. So the combination of these two things 
obviously had an impact on ASPs. But I think as I said or Tim said during the 
prepared remarks, we do expec
t iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we 
move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just 
mentioned are not going to repeat.
 
On cannibalization, of course we've got limited experience because the 
phone has been in the market just for
 
a few weeks. But when we look at our 
survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE 
is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of 
new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us
 
because 
we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. And we see a higher rate of 
previous iPhone owners that really prefer the four
-
inch form factor. We have 
not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus. 
Of course, there's al
ways going to be some level of cannibalization. But 
really to us what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to 
bring more people into the iOS ecosystem.

Thanks, just a couple questions for me. Luca, I just want to clarify that last 
po
int on ASPs on iPhone because last quarter it seemed that you were quite 
clear that that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company. So 
I understand there are other drivers going into the September quarter. But 
just to be clear, the phone uni
ts you didn't sell through that were depleted in 
channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well. That's the 
clarification.
 
And then for Tim, on the Services side, as Apple has spoken more and more 
loudly I guess in the last three or four
 
quarters, I just think about some of 
the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck I 
think in the 1960s and the 1970s and the experience hasn't changed. I 
understand you've got the Apple TV box out. But in terms of driving actual 
vi
deo

demand services, is that something that Apple wants to do 
themselves? Do you want a partner? Could you even build content? How do 
you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's

's not that meaningful to the 
overall company in terms of size? I'm just curious given the installed base 
and users you have. Thanks.

Kulbinder, on your question on iPhone ASP, I'm not sure if I understood it 
correctly. But clear
ly the iPhone SE has a downward impact on iPhone ASP, 
of course, because it comes at the low end of the range. From a gross 
margin perspective, it is slightly dilutive to company margins, but the impact 
is not particularly large.

Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. I 
just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch 
event of the year
. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation 
point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018. This year, we shipped our 2 
billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store, and 
achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in 
Apple's history.
 
In fiscal year 2018, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent 
of a Fortune 100 company in a single year, and we're capping all that off 
with our best September quarter ever. Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of 
our expectati
ons. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest 
growth rate in three years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% 
year
-
over
-
year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, services, and 
wearables drove our momentum and we produced str
ong double
-
digit 
revenue growth in all of our geographic segments.
 
It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over 
last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record 
fueled by continued momentum for iPhon
e 8, 8 Plus and X, and the very 
successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.
 
These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's 
first 7
-
nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple designed 8
-
core Neural 
Engine capable of executing
 
an astounding 5 trillion operations per second. 
The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap 
forward.
 
It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition, using real
-
time 
machine learning to transform the way we experi
ence photos, gaming, 
augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual camera system 
that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field 
and Face ID is even faster.
 
The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, iPho
ne XS and XS 
Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship, as well as seamlessly 
intuitive user experience. We're not done yet.
 
Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone 
breakthroughs to even more users. With an all

s
creen glass and aluminum 
design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews 
have been overwhelmingly positive.
 
iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more 
systems in its first month than any version of iOS e
ver. iOS 12 is delivering 
system
-
wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts, and new tools to 
help people reduce interruptions and manage screen time for themselves 
and their kids.
 
Siri Shortcuts in particular is already deeply integrated with some of t
he 
most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or 
rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are 
working together with Siri in the driver seat.
 
iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augme
nted reality 
engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi
-
user experiences and 
real
-
world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running 
with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use 
cases emerge. iOS devic
es deliver the best AR experiences of any products 
in the market today and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this 
week, we've made that gap even wider.
 
More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is 
unrivalled in its versat
ility and performance. When paired with the 
beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full
-
size Smart 
Keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and 
productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the hig
hly 
anticipated Group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime
-
enabled devices.
 
For services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. 
Excluding the impact of a favorable one
-
time accounting adjustment of $640 
million a year ago, our service
s growth was 27%.
 
We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all
-
time 
revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music 
and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions 
reaching over 3
30 million in our ecosystem.
 
I want to spotlight the exceptional performance at Apple Pay, which is by far 
the number one mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction 
volume tripled year
-
over
-
year. And to put that into perspective, Apple Pay 
g
enerated significantly more transactions than even PayPal Mobile with over 
4 times the growth rate.
 
As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of 
Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is 
now a
ccepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these 
additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations 
support Apple Pay.
 
We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent 
launch of student
 
ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 
months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest
-
rated mobile 
peer
-
to
-
peer service by Consumer Reports, based on exceptional payment 
authentication and data privacy.
 
We set an all
-
time quarter
ly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong 
performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back
-
to
-
school season. In 
September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to 
Mac like Dark Mode, Stacks and a completely redesigned Mac App St
ore. 
Consider alongside the release of iOS 12, WatchOS 5 and a new tvOS, 
macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world
-
class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem.
 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the 
call, earlier this week we announced 
exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all
-
new MacBook Air brings a 
stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more 
portable design to the world's most beloved notebook.
 
We also unveiled the b
iggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet 
muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects 
at Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular 
apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5 times 
faster 
performance than before.
 
With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for wearables, 
which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest 
customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an 
essential 
part of people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 
has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all
-
new design, larger 
display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and 
electrical heart sensor.
 
Later this year, the ECG App will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 
customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram 
any time, right from their wrist. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch 
Series 1 and later, WatchOS will s
oon enable periodic checks for irregular 
heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and 
potentially life
-
changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an 
indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an inte
lligent 
guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further 
example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space and we 
look forward to making more in the future.
 
We are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in S
pain last week 
as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the 
highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music 
subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room of your home.
 
Our retail team posted record
 
Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. 
They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to 
connect, learn, and be inspired together with people from their community. 
Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that
 
looks like in 
practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, 
connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators, and other 
experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores 
also hosted 74,00
0 kids at Apple Camp.
 
The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just 
making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, 
Japan, China, and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores 
where we can 
further those relationships, almost half of which are outside 
the United States.
 
Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on two items that may 
not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's 
mission and our commitm
ent to making the world a better place.
 
First education, more than 5,000 schools, community colleges, and technical 
colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding 
curriculum. Ideas, creativity, and passion for technology's potential ar
en't 
limited by zip code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be 
either.
 
We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world 
have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools 
and project guides
 
we introduced this spring, designed to help unleash kids' 
creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad.
 
Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment 
to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global
 
operations are 
powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in 
our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of 
new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% 
recycled aluminum, a strong,
 
durable, and beautiful new alloy designed by 
Apple.
 
This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that 
matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching 
old problems, and beautiful solutions that set us apart.
 
I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers, and business 
partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We 
are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we 
could not be more bullish
 
about Apple's future.
 
And now, Luca has more details to share with you on the September 
quarter. Luca?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.
 
We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September 
quarter, which c
apped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in 
which we saw double
-
digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and 
established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.
 
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% an
d more than $10 
billion over last year, with strong double
-
digit growth in each of our 
geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, 
Japan, and the rest of Asia
-
Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in 
almost every market we 
track, with especially strong growth in Germany, 
Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, and Korea, all major markets where 
revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue 
records for iPhone and wearables and new all
-
time records for se
rvices and 
Mac.
 
Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, in line with our expectations, as 
leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs.
 
We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS, and cash flow 
from operations. Net income 
was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over 
last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from 
operations was $19.5 billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago.
 
iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every 
geographic 
segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year ago, 
driven by strong performance of iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the 
successful launch of iPhone XS and XS Max in the September quarter this 
year, while we launched iPhone X in the December quarte
r last year.
 
We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter, with growth of 20% or 
more in several markets, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Norway, Chile, and Vietnam.
 
Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is t
he 
highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 
Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus 
combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in 
the December quarter, 80% plan to p
urchase iPhones.
 
Turning to services, it was our best quarter ever in total and virtually in 
every market around the world, with revenue of $10 billion. A year ago, we 
had a one
-
time $640 million favorable impact to services revenue due to an 
accounting ad
justment. And taking that into account, our services growth in 
Q4 this year was 27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all
-
time quarterly 
revenue records for many services categories, and we are well on our way to 
achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 
services revenue by 2020.
 
We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an 
increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very pleased not only with 
the growth but also with the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 
30,000 third
-
party subscription apps are available on the App Store today, 
and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total services 
revenue.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to our new 
MacBook Pro models that we launched i
n July, with strong double
-
digit 
revenue growth driving an all time quarterly record for Mac revenue. We 
were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging markets, with 
strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle East and Africa, and 
Central a
nd Eastern Europe.
 
At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Macs is at an all
-
time 
high, and the majority of customers purchasing Macs in the September 
quarter were new to Mac.
 
We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in n
early every 
market we track, based on the latest estimates from IDC. We generated iPad 
growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin 
America, Europe, Japan, India, and South Asia. Among customers around 
the world purchasing iPads duri
ng the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad, 
and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all
-
time high.
 
NPD indicates that iPad had 58% share of the U.S. tablet market in the 
September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the most recent 
co
nsumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction 
ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. And among business customers 
who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to 
purchase iPads.
 
Other products revenue grew 31% to
 
a new September quarter record with 
an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago thanks to wearables 
growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV, in addition to 
the introduction of HomePod earlier this year.
 
As we look back 
across fiscal 2018, we've made great progress in the 
enterprise market, where iOS is transforming how business gets done across 
multiple industries. In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the 
world have adopted iOS to help pilots fly saver,
 
more efficient flights and 
many airlines are also using iOS to support better customer experiences and 
improve maintenance operations.
 
We're also making great strides in the retail sector, where 9 of the top 10 
global retailers use iOS devices to transfor
m their customer and employee 
experiences. We're seeing industry
-
wide adoption of iOS at thousands of 
retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best
-
known retailers 
in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers 
replace
 
their traditional point
-
of
-
sale systems and use custom iOS apps on 
iPhones and iPads to provide highly personalized shopping experiences.
 
Our success in enterprise is supported by our key partnerships. Since 
launching our first strategic partnership with 
IBM, 240 large customers have 
signed MobileFirst for iOS deals. Additionally, earlier in the year we 
introduced two new technology offerings. IBM Watson services for Core ML, 
and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses 
to com
bine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic 
smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across numerous industries 
have been added since launching these new tools.
 
In our new partnership with Salesforce, we're excited to bring togethe
r the 
number one customer relationship management platform and iOS. Together 
with Apple, Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace a native mobile 
platform with exclusive new features on iOS. The companies will also provide 
tools and resources for mill
ions of Salesforce developers to build their own 
native apps with a new Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS.
 
And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a new way for 
IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The response from companies 
around th
e world has been tremendous with over 40,000 companies 
currently enrolled.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.1 
billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.5 billion in term 
debt and $12 billion in commerc
ial paper outstanding for a net cash position 
of $122.6 billion. As explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net 
cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $23 
billion to investors during quarter. We repurchased 9
2.5 million Apple shares 
for $19.4 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.5 billion 
in dividends and equivalents.
 
For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an 
all
-
time record. Every geographic segment grew 
double digits with new 
records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia
-
Pacific. We also set 
new all
-
time records for net income, up 23% versus last year, and EPS up 
29%. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during 
the year
, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over 
$73 billion in share repurchases.
 
Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a 
number of changes in our financial reporting that we're implementing as we 
enter o
ur new fiscal year. First, given the increasing importance of our 
services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our 
financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for 
both total products and total service
s beginning this December quarter.
 
Second, also beginning in this December quarter, we're adopting the FASB's 
new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change to 
our total revenue, but it will impact the way we report the classifica
tion of 
revenue between products and services. In particular, the revenue 
corresponding to the amortization of the deferred value of bundled services 
such as Maps, Siri, and free iCloud services was previously reported in 
product revenue. After adopting th
e new standard, this revenue will now be 
reported in services revenue. The change in classification between products 
and services will also apply to the costs that are associated with the delivery 
of such bundled services.
 
After we file our 10
-
K, we will p
ost a schedule to our Investor Relations 
website showing the reclassification of fiscal 2018 revenue from products to 
services in connection with the adoption of the new standard. The size of 
this reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company r
evenue. And 
for clarity, this reclassification was not contemplated in our previously stated 
goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. That goal remains 
unchanged and excludes the revenue that is now shifting from products to 
services over
 
that timeframe.
 
Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing 
unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our 
objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives, 
and to provi
de an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are 
highly satisfied, loyal and engaged.
 
As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow. As 
demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of 
units sold in 
any 90
-
day period is not necessarily representative of the 
underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, a unit of sale is less 
relevant for us today than it was in the past, given the breadth of our 
portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion withi
n any given product line.
 
Fourth, starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming the other 
products category to wearables, home, and accessories to provide a more 
accurate description of the items that are included in this product category.
 
As we 
move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we 
enter the holiday season and we expec
t revenue to be between $89 billion 
and $93 billion, a new all
-
time record.
 
This range reflects a number of factors to be considered. First, we 
considered the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the launch timing of our new iPhones 
this year versus last year. Second, w
e expect almost $2 billion of foreign 
exchange headwinds. Third, we have an unprecedented number of products 
ramping, and while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty 
around supply and demand balance. And fourth, we also face some 
macroeconom
ic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets.
 
We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to 
be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 
million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% before d
iscrete items.
 
Also today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per 
share of common stock payable on November 15, 2018 to shareholders of 
record as of November 12, 2018.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Thank you, Luca, and we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to two 
questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?
 
Question

and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of 
Amer
ica Merrill Lynch.
 
Wamsi Mohan 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Yes. Thank you. Tim, there has been some real deceleration in some of 
these emerging markets, partly driven by some concerns around some of 
the rules the administration is contemplating and par
tly driven by things that 
are more specific to China, for instance, like some of the regulations around 
gaming. So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the 
business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix 
and
 
Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions and I have 
a follow
-
up.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Sure. Great question. Starting with emerging markets. The emerging 
markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India,
 
Brazil, 
Russia. These are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent 
period. In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices and those markets 
are not growing the way we would like to see.
 
To give you a perspective in of some detail, our bus
iness in India in Q4 was 
flat. Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth. Brazil was down 
somewhat compared to the previous year. And so I think, or at least the way 
that I see these, is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different
 
story, and I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those 
for the most part.
 
In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our 
business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're 
very happy with. iPhone in particular was very strong, very strong double
-
digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a 
bit stronger than even the overall company number.
 
The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a 
moratorium, to be 
more accurate, on new game approvals. There is a new regulatory setup in 
China, and there things are not moving the way they were moving 
previously. We did see a few games approved recently, but it's very far 
below the historic pace. And 
as you've probably seen, some of the larger 
companies there that are public have talked about this as they've announced 
their earnings as well. We don't know exactly when this will 

 
the approvals 
will return to a normal pace, so I would not want to predic
t that.
 
I do not view 

 
just for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that that issue 
has anything to do with the trade
-
related discussions between the countries. 
I think that is strictly a domestic issue in China.
 
In terms of larger developers, if you st
ep back and look at the value 
proposition for people from the App Store, there are two key constituencies 
in that equation. There's the user and there's the developer.
 
If you start with the user, what the App Store provides people is the best 
and safest pl
ace for users to get apps. And we have a tremendous process 
and infrastructure around achieving that. And where it is not perfect, we 
wind up reviewing over 100,000 apps per week between new apps and 
updates for existing apps, and then work with developers
 
quickly to fix the 
issues. And we also provide the user a one
-
payment model for purchasing 
apps and subscriptions and in
-
app purchases, et cetera, so that they are not 
in a position that they have to share their private information across many 
companies. 
And so that's the proposition for the user.
 
For the developer, we obviously provide the developers a tremendous 
amount of developer tools, programs, compilers, languages, of course the 
operating system, APIs, SDKs, and have a huge developer relations team.
 
And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the 
new Today Editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal 
recommendations, search tools, and so on and so forth.
 
And so there will be 

 
there's no doubt in my mind th
ere have already been 
some large developers that concluded that they could do something on their 
own. We're fine with that. I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the 
largest 

 
if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of 
the ser
vices revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that 
context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or 
so subscription apps.
 
And so the subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store 
itself is, and 
so that's the value proposition. I think that the vast majority of 
people are very happy with it, including the most important people at all, 
which is the user.

If I could just ask you really quick on Apple's role in healthcare, it's been 
growing significantly since the early introduction in the Watch and then the 
various kits for develope
rs, including HealthKit, CareKit, et cetera. And when 
you combine that with your very staunch advocacy for privacy, I see Apple 
could become a really large disintermediating force in all the friction in the 
healthcare industry today in the way medical info
rmation is shared and 
distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple in healthcare? 
And do you see a means to also grow your services business through the 
healthcare offerings that could become subscriptions to your customers? 
Thank you.
 
Ti
mothy Donald Cook

I think Apple has a huge opportunity in health. And you can see from our 
past several years that we have an intense interest in the space and are 
adding products and services, non
-
monetized services, so far to that. And I 
do
n't want to talk about the future because I don't want to give away what 
we're doing, but this is an area of major interest to us. Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Shannon Cross from 
Cross Research has the next question.
 
Shannon S. Cross 
-
 
Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much for taking the question. Given the $4 billion range in 
revenue that you're giving for the quarter and all the things that are going 
on in the world right now, c
an you maybe give a little detail about the 
variables that you took into account when you were coming up with this? 
Geopolitical trade, macro, component costs, I don't know if you can just give 
us some ideas of what the puts and takes were. Thank you.
 
Luca
 
Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes, Shannon, I'll take this one. At the revenue level, we started from the 
fact that we are very, very excited about the lineup of products and services 
that we have getting into the holiday season. It's the strongest lineup that 
we
've ever had. And our guidance range, by the way, represents a new all
-
time quarterly revenue record.
 
As I explained in my prepared remarks, there are a number of things that 
need to be considered as part of this guidance range. The first one is the fact 
t
hat the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse 
order versus last year, and that has had an effect on Q4 and will have an 
effect on Q1.
 
Last year, we launched the top end of our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone 
X, during Q1 and 
placed the entirety of the channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. 
This year, we launched the top end of the lineup, which is the XS and the XS 
Max during Q4. Obviously, this resulted in more pronounced ASP growth in 
Q4 of 2018 and obviously a tougher compare for
 
Q1. So I think it's 
important to keep that in mind as you look at the revenue guidance that we 
provided.
 
The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we 
dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at 
c
urrencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated 
against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. And when we look at the 
impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we're 
looking at 200 basis points of hea
dwinds which translates, given our the size 
of our business, to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue.
 
The third point that I think it's important to keep in mind, and Tim has 
talked about this, we are launching, in the last six weeks, we've launche
d an 
unprecedented number of new products. They're all ramping right now. The 
ramps are going fairly well, but obviously we have some uncertainty around 
supply/demand balance for some of these products.
 
And then finally, the last point that we've 
taken into account is what Tim's 
talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic 
level in some emerging markets where clearly consumer confidence is not as 
high as it was 12 months ago. So take that into account and that's how we 
go
t to the range.

Okay. Thank you. And then, I just want to talk a little bit about the pullback 
in terms of guidance from a unit perspective. I understand you don't want to 
give guidance because of 90 days is a short pe
riod of time and it can 
fluctuate, but what kind of qualitative commentary do you think you'll be 
able to provide? Because it's obviously investors have spent the last 
however many years going P times Q. So, how should we think about what 
we can expect and
 
sort of how are you going to manage this process as we 
go through? I know it's all our job to forecast, but.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Yes. Let me walk you through the rationale that we've used and then I'll talk 
about this qualitative commentary that yo
u were mentioning. As I said, 
right, our objective is to make great products, provide the best customer 
experience, and get our customer satisfied, engaged and loyal to our 
ecosystem.
 
When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the las
t 
three years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has 
not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our 
business. If you look at our revenue, given the last three years, if you look 
at our net income during the las
t three years, if you look at our stock price 
here in the last three years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any 
given period.
 
As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major 
product categories have become wider over tim
e and therefore, a unit of 
sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we 
got this much wider sales price dispersion, so unit of sale per se becomes 
less relevant.
 
As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smar
tphones, in 
tablets, in computers, do not provide quarterly unit sales information either. 
But of course we understand that this is something of interest and when we 
believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional 
relevant inf
ormation to investors, we will do so.

Looking at one additional point there just for clarity is, Shannon, our 
intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and 
gross margin guidance in the other ca
tegories that we've been providing and 
so that our guidance isn't changing. It's the actual report that changes.

Thanks very much and good afternoon. With the staggered iPhone launch, 
were you able to discern any impact on the XS and XS Max from buyers 
potentially waiting for the XR, and what if anything can we take aw
ay from 
the December quarter guidance related to what you're seeing for early 
demand of the XR? And then I have a follow
-
up, thanks.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Mike, it's Tim. The XS and XS Max got off to a really great start and we've 
only been sel
ling for a few weeks. The XR, we've only had out there for I 
guess five days or so at this point, and so we have very, very little data 
there. Usually there is some amount of wait until another product shows up 
and look, but in looking at the data, on the 
sales data for XS and XS Max, 
there's not obvious evidence of that in the data, as I see it.

Got it, and you mentioned record levels for various components of the 
services business. As we look forward, if growth of servi
ces is to maintain 
something close to the recent pace, what are the components of services 
that you're particularly excited about that could drive that and be the 
strongest drivers? And maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news 
flow around augmente
d reality has slowed a little bit in recent months. Is 
that potentially a materially contributor to services in the near future? 
Thanks.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Mike, as we said, during the September quarter, we set new records for 
many, many services c
ategories, right, from Apple Music to cloud services to 
the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential 
trajectory right now.
 
When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we have 
a very large and growing installed 
base. The installed base of all our major 
product categories is at an all
-
time high and has been growing over the last 
several quarters, so the opportunity for us to monetize our services business 
continues to grow over time.
 
Of course, we're also improvin
g the quality of the services that we provide 
and if you look back during the last three years, we've added new services 
to our portfolio. We added Apple Pay, we added Apple Music. We added this 
advertising business on our App Store. And clearly, we will w
ant to continue 
to offer new services over time, so there are a number of vectors that allow 
us to continue to grow the business over time.
 
We have stated that we want to double the size of the services business 
from the level that we had in fiscal 2016 by
 
2020. We are well on pace to 
achieve that, and we feel very, very confident about the future and the 
opportunities that we have in the services space.

Mike, in terms of your question on AR, I have a different view than yo
u do 
on this one. Just a year ago, practically a year ago, we came out with ARKit 
1. Six months or so after that we came out with 1.5. We then recently came 
out with ARKit 2. The number of things that you can do are growing 
significantly. The number of dev
elopers that either have done something, or 
even more the case, that are working on things that I've seen are growing 
tremendously.
 
There's a lot of interest out there and the number of categories that I'm 
seeing from gaming to shopping, to I was in China 
a few weeks ago and saw 
AR in an art sense, in an art exhibit. I was in Berlin last week and saw it 
being used in a historical educational kind of sense. I'm seeing it sort of 
everywhere I go now, and so I think we are in the early days, and it'll keep 
get
ting better and better, but I'm really happy with where things are at the 
moment.

Next we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Thank you. Tim, given the current trade negotiations and broader 
geopolitical risk, do you have any plans to consider diversifying the supply 
chain? And if you were to do that, either on your own or sort of forced, do 
you think it 
would have significant impact on the business or profitability?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Katy, if you look at the products that we have created and are 
manufacturing, they're really manufactured everywhere. We have significant 
content from the U.S
. market. We have content from Japan to Korea to 
many countries, and we have great content from China as well, and so there 
are many hands in the products. The vast majority or almost all of the R&D 
is in the United States, as well as a lot of the support 
organizations.
 
And so, I think that that basic model where you look around the world and 
find the best in different areas, I don't expect that model to go out of style, 
so to speak. I think there's a reason why things have developed in that way 
and I think
 
it's great for all countries and citizens of countries that are 
involved in that.
 
And I'm still of the mindset that I feel very optimistic and positive that the 
discussions that are going will be fruitful. These relationships, these trade 
relationships ar
e big and complex, and they clearly do need a level of focus 
and a level of updating and modernization. And so I'm optimistic that the 
countries, the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe and so forth, can 
work these things out and work for the benefit of
 
everyone.

That's helpful color. And, Luca, as a follow
-
up, NAND prices fell significantly 
during the September quarter. Why aren't we seeing that flow through to 
margin expansion for the overall company?
 
Luc
a Maestri

You're referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I imagine.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Yes.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Let me give you the puts and takes, Katy. You're correct. We are going to be 
gettin
g some benefits from commodities in general and memory in 
particular. Memory on a sequential basis is about 30 basis points favorable 
for us going into the December quarter. And obviously, we're going to be 
benefiting from the leverage, which is typical of
 
our seasonality in the 
December quarter.
 
On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies have weakened 
against the U.S. dollar, and the impact that we expect at the gross margin 
level from foreign exchange is a 90 basis points headwind sequentially. 
And 
of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures 
because, as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last six 
weeks. So those are the puts and takes, leverage and commodity savings on 
one side and FX and the new pro
ducts on the other side.

Next, we'll go to Jim Suva with Citigroup.

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thank you very much, a question for Tim and a questi
on for Luca, and I'll 
ask them at the same time, so you can decide who wants to go first or 
second. But operationally, Tim, I think your company is at a disadvantage 
relative to others in India, giving where items are produced versus shipped 
versus taxed v
ersus installed as well as ability to own stores. So can you 
help us address that? Is India going to potentially be a big area, as I think 
you got about only about 1% market share, but it sounded like things may 
be softer there?
 
And then for Luca, there wi
ll probably be a lot of pushback about not giving 
iPhone unit data. It sounds like you're still going to give revenue data, if I 
heard that correctly, but some people may fear that this now means that the 
iPhone units are going to start going negative year
 
over year because it's 
easier to talk about great things and not show the details of things that 
aren't so great. So thank you very much, gentlemen.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Okay, I'll start with India. We've had really great productive 
discussions with 
the Indian government, and I fully expect that at some point, they will agree 
to allow us to bring our stores into the country. We've been in discussions 
with them, and the discussions are going quite well.
 
As you point out, there are 
import duties in some or most of the product 
categories that we're in. In some cases, they compound, and this is an area 
that we're giving lots of feedback on. We do manufacture some of the entry 
iPhones in India, and that project has gone well. I am a big
 
believer in India. 
I am very bullish on the country and the people and our ability to do well 
there.
 
The currency weakness has been part of our challenge there, as you can tell 
from just looking at the currency trends, but I view these as speed bumps 
alon
g a very long journey, though. And the long term I think is very, very 
strong there. There's a huge number of people that will move into the 
middle class. The government has really focused on reform in a major way 
and made some very bold moves. And I appla
ud them for doing that and I 
can't wait for the future there.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
And, Jim, let me take the question on units. First of all, as Tim said, our 
approach to guidance, providing guidance doesn't change at all. We continue 
to provide the 
same metrics that we were providing before.
 
In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's 
new and it's in addition to the information that we provide to investors 
because we've heard some significant level of interest around 
this, is starting 
with the December quarter, for the first time we're going to be providing 
information on revenue and cost of sales, and therefore gross margins for 
both products and services. And this will be the first time that we're going to 
provide gr
oss margin information for our services business, which we believe 
is an important metric for our investors to follow.
 
Given the rationale on why we do not believe that providing unit sales is 
particularly relevant for our company at this point, I can reas
sure you that it 
is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have. 
But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the 
past.
 
To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line 
have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very 
important because we're attracting customers to the most recent 
technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but 
you don't necessarily see that in the number tha
t is reported.
 
And so therefore, we will, as I said, we'll provide qualitative commentary 
when it is important and relevant. But at the end of the day, we make our 
decisions from a financial standpoint to try and optimize our revenue and 
our gross margin d
ollars, and that we think is the focus that is in the best 
interest of our investors.
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
Jim, let me just add a couple things to that for color. Our installed base is 
growing at double digit, and that's probably a much more s
ignificant metric 
for us from an ecosystem point of view and the customer loyalty, et cetera. 
The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you 
push your cart up to the cashier and she says, or he says how many units 
you have in
 
there? It doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there 
in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated 
First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call 
is being recorded.
 
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn 
the 
call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead, ma'am.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Before we begin, we 
want you to know that in addition to our press release and summary data 
sche
dule, we've published some supplemental material that we'll be referring 
to in our remarks today and you can find a link to this supplemental material 
on our Investor Relations' website, at apple.com/investor. And it's also 
included as an exhibit in the Fo
rm 8
-
K we filed with the SEC earlier today.
 
Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, 
Luca Maestri and after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.
 
Please note that some of the information you'll hear durin
g our discussion 
today will consist of forward
-
looking statements, including, without 
limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other 
income and expense, taxes and future business outlook.
 
Actual results or trends could differ 
materially from our forecasts. For more 
information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10
-
K 
for 2015 and the Form 8
-
K filed with the SEC today that I mentioned earlier, 
along with today's press release. Apple assumes no obligation 
to update any 
forward
-
looking statements or information which speaks as of their 
respective dates.
 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
 
Tim Cook
 
Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for 
joining
 
us. Today, we're reporting Apple's strongest financial results ever. 
We generated all
-
time record quarterly revenue of $75.9 billion in the 
December quarter, in line with our expectations and up 2% over last year's 
blockbuster results.
 
This is a huge acco
mplishment for our company, especially given the 
turbulent world around us. In constant currency, our growth rate would have 
been 8%. Our record revenue and continued strong operating performance 
also led to an all
-
time record quarterly net income of $18.4
 
billion.
 
We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the December quarter, an all
-
time high. To 
put that volume into perspective, it's an average of over 34,000 iPhones an 
hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 13 straight weeks. It's almost 
50% more than our Q1
 
volume just two years ago and more than four times 
our volume five years ago.
 
74.8 million iPhones is an incredible number and it speaks to both the 
immense popularity of iPhone and the phenomenal execution of our teams to 
deliver a massive number of devi
ces in such a short period of time.
 
Our results are particularly impressive, given the challenging global 
macroeconomic environment. We're seeing extreme conditions unlike 
anything we've experienced before just about everywhere we look.
 
Major markets, incl
uding Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, 
Australia, Turkey and the eurozone, have been impacted by slowing 
economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies.
 
Since the end of fiscal 2014, for instance, the euro and British poun
d are 
down double
-
digits, and major currencies such as the Canadian dollar, 
Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and Turkish lira have declined 20% or more. 
The Brazilian real is down more than 40% and the Russian ruble has 
declined more than 50%.
 
66% of Apple
's revenue is now generated outside the United States, so 
foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results. 
Page one of our supplemental material illustrates this point.
 
$100 of Apple's non
-
U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of 2014 transl
ated to only $85 
last quarter due to the weakening currencies in our international markets. As 
you can see, the movement has been dramatic. Last quarter alone, the 
currency impact has been very large.
 
Page two of our supplemental material illustrates our Q
1 revenue and 
growth rates expressed in constant currency. The 8% growth rate I spoke 
about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency revenue, which 
is $5 billion more than our reported revenue. For perspective, that difference 
is about the 
size of the annual revenue of a Fortune 500 company.
 
We know the conditions in China have been a source of concern for many 
investors. Last summer, while many companies were experiencing weakness 
in their China
-
based results, we were seeing just the opposi
te, with 
incredible momentum for iPhone, Mac and the App Store, in particular.
 
In the December quarter, despite the turbulent environment, we produced 
our best results ever in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% over last 
year, 47% sequentially, and 17
% year
-
over
-
year in constant currency. 
These great results were fueled by our highest ever quarterly iPhone sales 
and record App Store performance.
 
Notwithstanding these record results, we began to see some signs of 
economic softness in Greater China earli
er this month, most notably in Hong 
Kong. Beyond the short
-
term volatility, we remain very confident about the 
long
-
term potential of the China market and the large opportunities ahead of 
us and we are maintaining our investment plans.
 
Despite the economic
 
challenges all over the world, Apple remains incredibly 
strong. We have a very satisfied and loyal customer base. We saw a greater 
number of switchers from Android to iPhone than ever in Q1, and we are 
very optimistic about our business over the long
-
term
.
 
Innovation has always been the reason behind our success and we remain 
committed to making the best products in the world and expanding the 
Apple experience to change our customer's lives in better and more 
meaningful ways.
 
We've invested through economi
c uncertainty in the past and we've always 
come out stronger on the other side. In fact, some of the most important 
breakthrough products in Apple's history were born as a result of investing 
through the downturn. We've also seen these times as opportuniti
es to 
invest in new markets, just as we're doing now in areas such as India and 
other emerging markets.
 
Getting back to our record Q1 performance, let me give you some highlights 
of what we've accomplished since our last quarterly call together. We 
shipped
 
the amazing new iPad Pro, which has been extremely well received 
by customers along with a new smart keyboard and revolutionary Apple 
Pencil.
 
We launched the all
-
new Apple TV with its own App Store, laying the 
foundation for the future of television. We h
ad our best quarter by far for 
Apple TV sales and the number of apps developed for Apple TV is growing 
rapidly. Today there are over 3,600 apps delivering everything from games 
to entertainment to educational programming.
 
We expanded 
distribution of Apple Watch to almost 12,000 locations in 48 
countries during the quarter. As we expected, we set a new quarterly record 
for Apple Watch sales, with especially strong sales in the month of 
December.
 
We released OS X El Capitan, refining the
 
experience and improving 
performance for our Mac customers. We also updated the entire iMac family 
with stunning new retina displays and introduced a new line up of wireless 
accessories.
 
We launched Apple Pay in Canada and Australia with American Express 
and 
announced plans to bring this amazingly convenient, private, and secure 
mobile payment experience to China, Hong Kong, Spain and Singapore in 
the coming year.
 
Consumers have spent billions of dollars with Apple Pay. In the second half 
of 2015, we saw a
 
significant acceleration in usage, with a growth rate 10 
times higher than in the first half of the year.
 
There are now over 5 million contactless payment ready locations in the 
countries where Apple Pay is live today and it's soon to be accepted at 
thous
ands of Exxon and Mobil branded stations across the U.S. via their 
Speedpass+ app.
 
Finally, we also shared the incredible Apple Music experience with even more 
listeners, with over 10 million paying subscribers less than four months since 
customers began p
aying for the service.
 
Our financial position has never been stronger. We had the mother of all 
balance sheets, with almost $216 billion in cash, which translates to nearly 
$39 per diluted share of Apple stock. We continue to invest confidently in 
our futu
re and we also continue to return capital to our shareholders at a 
rapid pace.
 
Our investors have been asking for a while about the recurring nature of our 
business. Especially during a period of economic uncertainty, we believe it is 
important to apprecia
te that a significant portion of Apple's revenue recurs 
over time.
 
First and foremost, our customer satisfaction and retention rates are second 
to none and provide us with a long lasting foundation. For example, recent 
consumer surveys by 451 Research, for
merly known as ChangeWave, 
measured an incredible 99% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone 6S and 6S 
Plus and an equally impressive 97% rate for the iPad Air 2. They also 
indicate that our iPhone loyalty rate is almost twice as strong as the next 
highest 
brand.
 
In addition, a growing portion of our revenue is directly driven by our 
existing install base. Because our customers are very satisfied and engaged, 
they spend a lot of time on their devices and purchase apps, content, and 
other services.
 
They also 
are very likely to buy other Apple products or replace the one that 
they own. And because of the enduring value of the device, their replacing is 
likely higher to be given or sold to someone who will also love and use it 
often.
 
So, as a result, our install
 
base has been growing very fast and has recently 
reached a major milestone, crossing 1 billion active devices for the first time. 
This is an unbelievable asset for us. Because our install base has grown 
quickly, we have also seen an acceleration in the gr
owth of our services 
business, another large and important source of recurring revenues.
 
Now that we have reached this milestone of 1 billion active devices, we felt 
this would be a great opportunity to share more information on what has 
become one of the 
largest service businesses in the world.
 
So now, I'd like to turn the call to Luca, who will provide more insight into 
how our platform has grown, followed by details on our record quarterly 
results.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyon
e. Each quarter, we report 
results for our Services category, which includes revenue from iTunes, the 
App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and some other items. 
Today, we would like to highlight the major drivers of growth in this 
category, 
which we have summarized on page three of our supplemental 
material.
 
The vast majority of the services we provide to our customers, for instance, 
apps, movies and TV shows, are tied to our installed base of devices, rather 
than to current quarter sales.
 
Fo
r some of these services, such as content, we recognize revenue based on 
transaction value. For some of the services, such as the App Store, we share 
a portion of the value of each transaction with the app developer and only 
recognize revenue on the portio
n that we keep.
 
To fully comprehend the scale of the services that we are delivering to our 
installed base and how fast this business is growing, we look at purchases in 
addition to revenue. When we aggregate the purchase value of services tied 
to our inst
alled base during fiscal 2015, it adds up to more than $31 billion. 
That's an increase of 23% over fiscal 2014.
 
In the recent December quarter, purchases of installed base services 
reached $8.9 billion, which is a growth rate of 24% year
-
over
-
year.
 
The siz
e and growth of these services tied to our installed base compare 
favorably to other services companies you're familiar with. Our installed base 
services are also quite profitable, with gross margins that, on a purchase 
value basis, are similar to our comp
any average.
 
Also, we're very excited by the scale and growth of our active installed base, 
as we indicate on page four. We define an active device as one that has 
been engaged with our services within the past 90 days. Our active installed 
base has recent
ly past 1 billion devices with year
-
over
-
year growth of more 
than 25%.
 
Apple is in a unique position of strength. We have world class scales in 
hardware, software and services all under one roof, which lets us innovate in 
ways that other companies can't.
 
W
e have built a huge installed base around four platforms, iOS, Mac OS, 
watchOS and tvOS. We have tremendously satisfied and loyal customers 
who are engaged with our services at a fast growing rate. All of this provides 
us with an unparalleled foundation fo
r the future of Apple business.
 
Let me now turn to the details of our record breaking December quarter. As 
Tim said, revenue was $75.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 2% year
-
over
-
year. Our growth was driven by all
-
time record iPhone sales, all
-
tim
e 
record revenue from services, the expanded availability of Apple Watch, and 
the successful launch of the new Apple TV.
 
We achieved this record revenue performance despite a very large negative 
impact from the weakness of foreign currency and in constant 
currency; our 
revenue growth rate was 8%.
 
We once again achieved very impressive results in Greater China, with 
revenue growing 14% year
-
over
-
year and 47% sequentially to an all
-
time 
record of $18.4 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall,
 
up 11% year
-
over
-
year and representing 34% of total company revenue for 
the quarter.
 
Company gross margin was 40.1%, up sequentially and better than our 
expectations, mainly due to favorable commodity costs and product mix.
 
Operating margin was 31.9% of 
revenue and net income was $18.4 billion, a 
new all
-
time record. Diluted earnings per share was $3.28, a 7% year
-
over
-
year increase over our previous all
-
time record and cash flow from 
operations was very strong, at $27.5 billion.
 
For details by product, I
 
will start with iPhone. We sold 74.8 million iPhones 
in the quarter, an increase of 300,000 compared to last December quarter's 
sensational results. Total iPhone sales grew 76% in India and more than 
45% in Korea, Middle East and Africa.
 
Sales were also u
p 20% or more in many western European countries and 
grew 18% in Mainland China. iPhone ASP was $691 compared to $687 in the 
year ago quarter, in spite of a very unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
 
We continue to see very strong interest in iPhone not onl
y with consumers 
but also with business users. Among corporate buyers planning to purchase 
smartphones in the March quarter, 451 Research found that 79% planned to 
purchase iPhones. That is the highest iPhone purchase intent in the eight
-
year history of th
e survey.
 
We started the quarter below our channel inventory target range and thanks 
to an extremely successful manufacturing ramp; we were able to exit the 
quarter slightly above the low end of our target range of five to seven weeks 
of iPhone channel inv
entory.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.3 million Macs compared to 
5.5 million last year, a decline of 4%. We continued our long running trend 
of PC market share gains, based on IDC's latest estimate of an 11% global 
market contraction, and
 
we were especially happy with 27% year
-
over
-
year 
Mac sales growth in Mainland China. We ended the quarter within our four to 
five
-
week target range for Mac channel inventory.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold 16.1 million, compared to 21.4 million in the year 
ago 
quarter, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven
-
week target 
range of iPad channel inventory.
 
In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be 
highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 85% share 
of t
he U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data 
published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 67% of the U.S. 
commercial tablet market comprising enterprise, government, and 
education.
 
iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive
. In November, 451 
Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and 
among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 
65% plan to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction 
rate for iPad and 
a March quarter purchase intent of 73%.
 
Our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. IBM released 48 new IBM 
MobileFirst for iOS apps in the December quarter and there are now over 
100 apps in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS catalog for iPhone, iPad and Appl
e 
Watch.
 
Our partnership with Cisco has gained significant momentum since we 
announced it at the end of August. Our engineering teams are on track to 
deliver exciting new capabilities that create a fast lane for iOS business 
users by optimizing Cisco netwo
rks for iOS devices and apps, integrate 
iPhone with Cisco enterprise environments and provide unique collaboration 
opportunities on iPhone and iPad.
 
We are also continuing to grow our mobility partner program. We added 
more than 25 partners in the December
 
quarter, bringing the total to over 
90. One great example of our progress in the enterprise is Eli Lilly, who 
boosted sales productivity by equipping 15,000 field based personnel across 
the world with iPad. A leader in mobile technology, Lilly has elimina
ted 
laptops in the field and is upgrading its U.S. field sales teams to iPad Pro.
 
Turning to services, we generated almost $6.1 billion in revenue, including 
$548 million we received from a patent infringement dispute. Excluding that 
amount, our services r
evenue was $5.5 billion, a new all
-
time record and an 
increase of 15% over last year, thanks in large part to strong growth from 
apps.
 
Revenue from the App Store increased 27% and the number of transacting 
customers grew 18%, also setting an all
-
time recor
d. Among our customers 
who purchased apps and content from our iTunes stores, the average 
amount spent per customer reached an all
-
time high in the December 
quarter.
 
Revenue from other products grew strongly, up 62% over last year, thanks 
to the growing co
ntribution from Apple Watch, as well as the successful 
launch of the new Apple TV, both of which established new all
-
time quarterly 
records. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course 
of the quarter and we experienced especially str
ong results during the 
holiday buying season.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $215.7 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.1 
billion. $200 billion of this cash or 93% of the total was outsi
de the United 
States.
 
We returned over $9 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 
billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $3 billion to repurchase 26 
million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched 
our sixth ac
celerated share repurchase program, spending $3 billion and 
receiving an initial delivery of 20.4 million shares.
 
We have now completed over $153 billion of our $200 billion program, 
including $110 billion in share repurchases. As we have done in the past,
 
we 
plan to provide an update on our capital return program when we report our 
second quarter results in April.
 
We also plan to be very active in the U.S. and international debt markets in 
2016, in order to fund our capital return activities. Also today, o
ur Board of 
Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock 
payable on February 11, 2016, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 
2016.
 
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes th
e types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call.
 
We expect revenue to be between $50 billion and $53 billion. We are 
providing a wider range for revenue than usual for the second quarter 
because of the volatility 
we are seeing in the economy and in the financial 
and currency markets.
 
We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 39.5%. We believe these 
are extremely strong margins in light of the headwinds we face from foreign 
exchange and the sequential loss of lev
erage. We expect OpEx to be 
between $6 billion and $6.1 billion, we expect OI&E to be about $325 
million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.
 
As you know, we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter and it's 
difficult for us to forecast 
economic and foreign exchange factors; however, 
at this point, we believe the March quarter faces the most difficult year
-
over
-
year compare relative to the rest of the year.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Your first question will come from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Hi, thank you very much. Just in terms of your March quarter guidance, it 
does imply a double
-
digit decline at the midpoint. Maybe if you can just 
clarify, first of all, what FX headwind is embedded in that?
 
And then just going to the fund
amental underpinning reasons for that, how 
much of it do you think has to do with international markets in terms of 
weakening demand and how much of that do you think is comps versus any 
other factors you might identify, such as a response to higher prices
 
for the 
iPhone in certain overseas markets?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Simona. Let me take this one. In constant currency, when you 
look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 
10%. So, we are looking at a 400 basis point impact fro
m foreign exchange 
for the March quarter.
 
You talked about a number of issues that are, in fact, included in this 
guidance. In addition to lapping, of course, a very strong year ago quarter 
--
 
just remind you that revenue growth a year ago was up 27%, ther
e's a 
number of things that we're facing.
 
The macroeconomic environment is weakening. When you think about all the 
--
 
particularly all the commodity
-
driven economies, Brazil and Russia and 
emerging markets, but also Canada, Australia in developed markets, 
clearly 
the economy is significantly weaker than a year ago. We talked about the 
unfavorable FX, which again is 400 basis points.
 
One of the things that we've done to respond to the foreign exchange 
situation has been to increase the price of some of our p
roducts in certain 
international markets. That has had the effect of protecting our margins, 
which you've seen have been very strong, both in the December quarter and 
in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter.
 
But inevitably over time, higher p
rices affect demand and so we're capturing 
that in our guidance. So, I would say these are the major reasons and the 
drivers for the guidance on revenue.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question please?
 
Op
erator
 
And next from Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.
 
Gene Munster
 
Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone upgrade 
program and the theme of iPhone as a subscription? In particular, do you 
believe that this could have a
 
measurable impact on the December quarter 
once we anniversary this? And then any thoughts on rolled outside the U.S. 
when that program would.
 
And I guess my follow
-
up question would be I know you can't talk about new 
products, but any high level thoughts 
on the virtual reality theme. Do you 
think this is more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream?
 
Tim Cook
 
On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, 
as you know for us, will always be the product and the exp
erience. And so 
that's first and foremost. Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the 
level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. It was the highest ever 
by far. And so we see that as a huge opportunity.
 
Thirdly, the markets, sort of the emer
ging markets broader than BRIC, but 
including all of emerging, when I look at our share in these markets and the 
LTE penetration, I see huge opportunities.
 
In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be 
meaningful as customers get in
to a different pattern. How much of that 
plays out in the Q1 of 2017 range is difficult to say. My own sense would be 
that the other items I've mentioned are probably more important but I am 
optimistic about the upgrade program as well.
 
Gene Munster
 
And th
en virtual reality?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah. In terms of virtual reality, no, I don't think it's a niche. I think it can 
be 
--
 
it's really cool and has some interesting applications.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Gene.
 
Gene Munster
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Could we 
have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
From Morgan Stanley, Katy Huberty.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Yes, thanks. I appreciate the macro comments as it relates to guidance, but 
can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking consumers might react 
from an ASP perspe
ctive? Do you expect consumers to move down the 
product line, given the macro environment?
 
And then also, how is channel inventory influencing guidance? Do you feel 
like channel inventory needs to come down, given the demand trends? And 
then I have a follo
w
-
up.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Couple of points here, Katy. Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December 
quarter. We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in 
the December quarter. Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on 
that number was $4
9. So, obviously, the mix of products was very strong. 
We had great reception for the new iPhones that we launched at the end of 
September. Of course, we have a very strong mid
-
tier this year in the 
portfolio, with 6 and 6 Plus.
 
But overall, when you look 
at the outcome during the December quarter, it 
was very, very strong. So, we feel very good about that and we feel that we 
have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone.
 
On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the 
December quarter
 
--
 
and we mentioned it back in October below our target 
range of five to seven weeks. We have built a bit of inventory during the 
course of the December quarter. But we have exited at the low end of the 
five to seven weeks. So, we feel that we are in good
 
shape there. And we've 
exited the quarter also on iPad and Mac well within the ranges that we want 
to have.
 
Katy Huberty
 
And then as a follow
-
up, back in October you guided fiscal 2016 CapEx up 
over 30%. What's driving that growth? Can you sort of rank it
 
between 
equipment purchases, data center, and real estate? And given the slowdown 
that you started to see in December, are you still comfortable with that level 
of investment growth? Thanks.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. So that is kind of the ranking, Katy. It start
s always for us with our 
tooling and manufacturing process equipment and that is up a bit year
-
over
-
year. Then we've got data centers and data centers is a growing expenditure 
for us, because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed 
base of 
customers and devices is growing, and is growing very significantly. 
And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services 
that are tied to the installed base. So, that type of expenditure goes 
together with the installed base.
 
And t
hen around facilities, you probably know that we are nearing 
completion of our new campus here in Cupertino, and so this is the year 
where we've got our peak requirements in terms of capital.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question pl
ease?
 
Operator
 
From Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes. Thank you. I have a question, a follow
-
up, please. To start, just on 
iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline 
in iPhones for fiscal Q2,
 
which I think, unless you really see a change in 
demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline 
year
-
over
-
year for fiscal 2016.
 
And I'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow
-
up 
questions are is that beca
use you believe the smartphone market won't grow 
or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? Is that because 
Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year 
and that's why we'll see a decline in units?
 
Or is the
re something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where 
the market is moving to much lower price points? But I'm wondering, and 
Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely 
to be a decline in iPhone units and how w
e put that in the context of how we 
should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you 
highlighted.
 
Tim Cook
 
Toni, we do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter. We don't think 
that they will decline to the levels 
that you're talking about. We aren't 
projecting beyond the quarter, as Luca mentioned earlier. But at this point in 
time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare.
 
We believe it's the toughest compare because of the year ago quarter also 
had catch up in it f
rom Q1. If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained 
throughout the whole of Q1 and so some of that demand moved into Q2.
 
Plus we're in an environment now that is dramatically different from a 
macroeconomic point of view than last Q2, from a currency 
point of view, 
from the level of which we've had to adjust pricing in several of these 
markets, and sort pf the overall [Indiscernible] in virtually every country in 
the world. And so it's really all of those factors that play in there and it's 
difficult t
o sort out how much is due to which one.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Right. I mean can you speak to any of the points around your expectation 
for the smartphone market or whether you think your replacement cycle has 
changed or whether your ability to gain share has ch
anged?
 
Tim Cook
 
The market itself, we don't spend a lot of time on predicting. Our view has 
always been that if we do 
--
 
if we make a great product and have a great 
experience that we ought to be able to convince enough people to move 
over.
 
And so as I loo
k at sort of your 
--
 
maybe your broader umbrella point about 
a question on saturation, the metrics I see would strongly suggest 
otherwise. For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last 
quarter were to people who were buying their first
 
iPhone.
 
And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, 
our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low, I mean in some 
cases, it's zero, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a 
tremendous number o
f people in the world, that will buy smartphones and 
we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Okay. And I just have clarifications; I don't really have a follow
-
up question. 
Luca you had talked about channel inventory increa
sing, it was 18.4 million 
for iPhone last quarter. Can you tell us how many more units you had this 
quarter?
 
And then I'm not sure if I misheard you, but I think you said your total 
installed base grew 25% year
-
over
-
year. Can you confirm that? Because if 
s
ervices grew at 13% and your installed base grew at 25%, it almost implies 
your penetration of your installed base, in terms of your ability to sell 
services, is going down.
 
Luca Maestri
 
So, 
--
 
maybe I'm going to start with services, Toni. The reason why w
e 
added this 
--
 
I think it's page three of our supplemental material, is to try 
and explain that a couple of steps. The first one is that of the services that 
we report, there's a portion, about 85% of all of the services that we report 
is directly tied to
 
the installed base.
 
There is a smaller portion of our services business that is not related to 
installed base and more related to when we sell a device. A perfect example 
would be an Apple Care agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale 
of the de
vice.
 
And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base driven 
services business, there is a part that is related to 
--
 
where we recognize 
revenue in terms of the full transaction value. And then there are 
transactions, like for example, App S
tore sales, where a portion of the 
transaction does not get recognized by Apple, but it goes to the developer.
 
So, when you look at it from a purchase value standpoint, actually in the 
December quarter, we grew 24%, and for the fiscal 2015, we grew at 23%.
 
So, we are growing at very, very healthy levels okay. And to reconfirm the 
growth of the installed base, yes, it was over 25%.
 
To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel 
inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the
 
December quarter. 
Keep in mind; we started in acquisition where we were below our targeted 
range. We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much. I had a question about gross margin. Luca, you got 
gross margins of 39% to 39.5% in your guidance and that includes hedging. 
So, I'm curious about the puts or takes in there.
 
And then can you clarify if within the gross margin this quarter that had the 
IP licensing contribution, as well? Any color you can give, both on this 
quarter's gross margin puts and takes, and then also the March quarter. And 
then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. So, 
--
 
certainly Shannon, let me start with Q1. I think when you say IP 
licensing; you mean this patent dispute that was resolved. Yes, it was 
included in the gross margins and it was worth 40 basis points in the 40.1% 
that we reported fo
r Q1.
 
For the second quarter, the puts and takes are actually quite simple. From 
an FX standpoint, the negative impact on a sequential basis from the 
December quarter is 50 basis points.
 
Then of course, I would say by far the largest impact on margins for 
the 
quarter is the loss of leverage, because that's part of our seasonal pattern, 
which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for 
a number of quarters now. And in a way, it's the other side of the coin of the 
foreign exchange sit
uation.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Okay. Thanks. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about 
--
 
and I apologize, I 
sort of lost my voice here. Can you talk a bit about leverage within the 
model? I know you said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in 
China and
 
all of that.
 
But given some of the pressures you're seeing, how do you think about 
where you spend that incremental SG&A dollar and that R&D dollar? And 
how should we think about it, given you're running $6 billion a quarter?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah, on the 
R&D, Shannon, we're continuing to invest without pause. We 
have some great things in the pipeline and we very much believe strongly in 
investing through downturns, such as the one that everyone is going 
through.
 
In terms of SG&A, we obviously seek to throt
tle expenditures in SG&A to the 
business level, with the exception of where we're investing in new stores 
and, for example, our expansion plans in China have not changed.
 
We are maintaining our investment profile and plans there. We are also 
continuing to 
invest in markets where we believe they are great places for 
Apple for the long
-
term, like India, as an example of that one.
 
And finally, even in the markets where today, grandly, it looks fairly bleak, 
from Russia and Brazil and some of the other economie
s that are very much 
tied to our oil
-
based economies.
 
We do believe that this, too, shall pass and that these countries will be great 
places and we want to serve customers in there and so we're not 
retrenching. That's not 
--
 
we don't believe in that. We fo
rtunately are strong 
enough to continue investing and we think it's in Apple's best long
-
term 
interest to do so.
 
Obviously, from a cost point of view, the downside of economic stress is that 
some asset prices get cheaper, commodity prices get cheaper, and 
that sort 
of thing. And so I think this is exactly the period that you want to invest and 
do so confidently.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
We'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UB
S.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Steve, are you there?
 
Tim Cook
 
Steve?
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Let's go on to the next question please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel.
 
Brian White
 
Tim, could you talk a little bit about the next leg of growth in China? 
Obviously, Apple has done a phenomenal job there, but where do we see the 
next leg coming from? And also, you mentioned investing in India. Where do 
you see that over the next two to three years? I think there's 1 billion mobile 
subscribers there, almost t
he size of China. Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah. Brian, good question. In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the 
end of last October, which is the last data I've got, was in the mid
-
20s. And 
so there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are 
still running 
on 3G handsets.
 
Also, I've talked about this before, but I think it's worth mentioning again, 
because it's easy to lose perspective with some of the things you read every 
day, is that the middle
-
class in China was less than 50 million people 
in 
2010, and by 2020, it's projected to be about half a billion.
 
And so there's just an enormous number of people moving into the middle
-
class. And we think this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of 
those customers into the Apple ecosystem.
 
And so I think the demographics are great. We're continuing to invest in 
retail stores. Angela and her team have been on this very aggressive rollout 
plan. We now have 28 stores in Greater China and we're on target to have 
40 in the summertime of this year
.
 
And so we're continuing on distribution. Obviously, we've got product things 
in mind and are crafting our products and services with China heavily in 
mind. We remain very bullish on China and don't subscribe to the doom and 
gloom kind of predictions fran
kly.
 
In India, India is also incredibly exciting. India's growth, as you know, is 
very good. It's quickly becoming the fastest growing BRIC country. It's the 
third largest smartphone market in the world, behind China and the United 
States.
 
The population o
f India is incredibly young. The median age there is 27. I 
think of the China age being young, at 36, 37 and so 27 is unbelievable. 
Almost half the people in India are below 25. And so I see the demographics 
there also being incredibly great for a consumer
 
brand and for people that 
really want the best products.
 
And as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. 
India revenue for us in Q1 was up 38%. We also had currency issues in 
India, as everybody else did. Constant currency growth wa
s 48%.
 
And so it's a very rapidly expanding country. And I think the government 
there is very interested economic reforms and so forth that I think all speak 
to a really good business environment for the future.
 
Brian White
 
Okay, great. Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
We'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
Thank you. My question's for Tim on the iPhone business. You talk a lot 
about the macroeconomic wea
kness weighing on units, but is some of the 
issue just that last year replacement got accelerated and this year it's kind 
of normalizing, and that's kind of a one
-
time headwind in terms of the unit 
growth that you see in that business. Is any of that going
 
on, or is that not 
material, in your view?
 
And the other follow
-
up I had was that you've mentioned in recent calls, 
helpfully, the percent of the base, prior to when the 6 came out, that were 
now on the larger screen phones. Can you give us an update on w
hat that 
number is? I think the last time it was in the low 30s. Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah. So, last question first. The number of people who had an iPhone prior 
to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements 
--
 
and so this was in September 
of 2014 that have not yet
 
upgraded to a 6, 6 Plus or 6s or 6s Plus is now 
60%. So, another way to think about that is 40% have, 60% have not.
 
In terms of your initial question about is there some of the compare issue 
that are people that ran out quickly to buy a 6 and 6 Plus and s
ort of 
accelerated? There is no doubt that we had a unbelievable year last year and 
the Q2 was particularly really, really strong because of the pent
-
up demand 
that left from Q1 in addition to Q2. And so there's no doubt about that.
 
However, I think you ca
n tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about 
just on the currency side and that's before thinking through the affect that 
price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time, 
it's clear that the economic piece is large.
 
Kulbinder
 
Garcha
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Kulbinder. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
And next we'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Mr. Milunovich, you 
may want to check your mute button.
 
Tim Cook
 
Steve, are you there?
 
Nancy 
Paxton
 
Okay. Let's try the next question please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll hear from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.
 
Mark Moskowitz
 
Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. A question and a follow
-
up. As far as the 
question, Tim, I wanted to get a better sense from you in t
erms of what is 
the overarching message of introducing a little more details here around 
services. Is this really to just reinforce the power of the franchise or the 
platform at Apple in terms of to really navigate tougher macro times in 
terms of the highe
r level recurring revenue, or is it a stepping stone to much 
more in terms of Apple service, i.e. I think of all the stuff you do on the data 
center side. Could we eventually have seen, with the help of IBM and Cisco 
that you eventually move more into the 
cloud services for the enterprise?
 
Tim Cook
 
So, good question. We started breaking out services, as you know, in the 
beginning of fiscal year 2015. And as that business has grown and as it 
became clear to us that the investors wanted 
--
 
investors and analy
sts 
wanted more visibility into that business, we've now elected to break it out 
and show the full size, scope, growth, and make comments on the 
profitability of it from a transparency point of view.
 
I do think that the assets that we have in this area are
 
huge and I do think 
that it's probably something that the investment community would want to 
and should focus more on.
 
In terms of our future plans, I wouldn't want to comment about any 
particular thing, but obviously, with breaking this out, we wouldn't 
be 
breaking it out if it wasn't an area that was very important to us in the 
future.
 
Mark Moskowitz
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Thank you.
 
Mark Moskowitz
 
And I wanted to follow
-
up on the upgrade advance program dynamics. Can 
you talk a little more about what
 
you're seeing in terms of in
-
store at the 
Apple Stores? Are you seeing any sort of dislocation in terms of folks who 
are moving to the upgrade or finance program, are they moving more 
toward Apple versus maybe the in
-
store percentage that used to be relat
ed 
to the carriers?
 
In other words, are folks just going with Apple now, instead of the carriers, 
when they buy their phone, as part of these upgrade programs?
 
Tim Cook
 
No, I don't 
--
 
honestly, this has nothing to do with wanting to move 
customers from one
 
person to another. This has to do with wanting to 
provide customers a very simple way to upgrade. Because we serve a 
significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone 
when it's new and when it comes out, and so we've designed a progra
m that 
made it simple and easy to do that. I have no idea over time how the 
percentage of the sales will vary between carriers and the Apple retail store, 
but that's not our overriding objective.
 
Mark Moskowitz
 
Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon.
 
Nancy 
Paxton
 
Thank you, Mark. We have time for one more question.
 
Operator
 
And your final question will come from Jim Suva with Citi.
 
Jim Suva
 
Thank you very much. A question for Tim and then a detail follow
-
up for 
Luca. Tim, with the macro situation changing, a
 
lot of CEOs view that and 
their strategy is very different go
-
to
-
market strategy, some change the way 
they go to market, some change their products.
 
In the past, Apple's been very known in always having a premium product. 
With the slowdown in the macro FX
 
and also GDP revision, is Apple's 
strategy go
-
to
-
market still always at premium product, or is there a need to 
go to more also a middle market or lower price point to attract more 
customers? Just because it seems like growing that installed base and 
servi
ces, as you pointed out, really economically could really help out Apple 
in the long
-
term.
 
And then the financial question for Luca is on that patent litigation, Luca, 
when you gave guidance three months ago, did you have a view that that 
was coming in? An
d if so, was that included in the guidance or not, or was 
that post the quarter guidance?
 
And I assume it's all one
-
time this quarter you recorded it, it's all gross 
margin, and then we don't cause that to reoccur again going forward. Thank 
you very much.

Our strategy is always to make the best products. And that 
--
 
for the 
smartphone market, that we are able to provide though several different 
price points for our customers. We have the premium part of our line is the 
6s and the 6s Plus.
 
We also h
ave a mid
-
price point, with the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. 
And we continue to offer the iPhone 5s in the market and it continues to do 
quite well. And so we offer all of those and I don't see us deviating from that 
approach.
 
We always want to offer so
mebody the 
--
 
not 
--
 
we don't design to a certain 
price point. We design a great product and we make it priced at a great 
value. And today, we're able to offer all three of those different iPhone 
options.

And Jim, on the patent question, yes, 
obviously this is a one
-
off item that 
affected the December quarter. As I said earlier, it's worth 40 basis points. 
So, without it, our gross margin would have been 39.7%. It will not repeat 
going forward.
 
To your question around was it included in the gui
dance, yes, the probability 
of receiving the amount was incorporated in the development of the 
guidance range. If you remember, we guided to 39% to 40%, and that 
number was included within the range.

Thank you very much gentlemen.

Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. Since 
we spoke in July, it's been an exciting and very busy time, so we have lots of 
great things t
o talk about today.
 
Just last month, we launched the biggest advancements in iPhone's history 
with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones are the best we have ever 
created and customers absolutely love them.
 
Our operational team has done an extraordinar
y job executing the 
manufacturing ramp throughout the entire supply chain. Today we've 
launched in 32 countries including China and our new iPhones will be shifting 
in 69 countries and territories by the end of this month, making this our 
fastest and most 
successful iPhone launch ever.
 
Demand for the new iPhones has been staggering and geographically broad
-
based markedly higher in every single country where we've launched 
compared to the iPhone 5s a year ago.
 
We're working hard to fill orders as fast as pos
sible and we're on track to be 
in more than 115 countries by the end of December.
 
Last month we introduced two new categories; the first is Apple Pay, an 
entirely new way to pay for things in stores and in apps. It makes mobile 
payments easier, more secure
 
and more private. Apple Pay went live today 
and now making purchases and participating stores happens with just a 
touch of a finger.
 
Paying within apps is as easy as selecting Apple Pay and placing a finger on 
Touch ID. Today Apple Pay supports credit and
 
debit cards from the three 
major payment networks and the top U.S. banks and over 500 additional 
banks have signed on and will be supporting Apple Pay beginning this year 
and early next year. Apple Pay is being supported by many of the nation's 
top retail
ers and we continue to sign more retailers.
 
The second new category is Apple Watch, our most personal device ever and 
one that has already captured the world's imagination. We can't wait to get 
Apple Watch to customers beginning in early calendar 2015. We'
ll be 
providing more details on Apple Watch as we get closer to the shipment day.
 
Last week we launched the new iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 with innovations 
that make them dramatically better than previous generation and the 
stunning new iMac with a Retina 
5K display.
 
We released iOS 8 last month and our customers are enjoying new ways to 
use their iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with intuitive new features and 
groundbreaking security.
 
Last week, we also released OS X Yosemite, with an all new design and 
continui
ty features that deliver an even more fluid experience across all of 
our iOS devices and Mac.
 
These introductions reflect years of innovation and hard work by teams all 
across Apple and they demonstrate the seamless integration of hardware, 
software and se
rvices that provides unparallel user experiences for our 
customers. These are things that only Apple can do.
 
We've also communicated and demonstrated our commitment to respecting 
and protecting users' privacy with strong encryption and strict policies that
 
govern how our data is handled.
 
Today we're also reporting very strong results for Apple's fourth fiscal 
quarter. We generated our strongest revenue growth rate in seven quarters 
far surpassing our expectations we communicated in July and establishing a 
n
ew record for Apple's September quarter revenue.
 
We're also reporting gross margin of 38% compared to 37% last year, 
leading to a very strong EPS growth of 20%. Fueled by the launch of iPhone 
6 and 6 Plus and strong demand for our previous iPhone models, w
e set a 
new September quarter record for iPhone with revenue growth of 21% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Demand for iPhone was strong across all geographies with global unit sell
-
through growth of 26% and we exited the quarter with significant backlog 
for both iPhone 6 
and 6 Plus.
 
We established an all
-
time quarterly record for Mac sales with revenue 
growing 18% year
-
over
-
year, thanks in particular to the very strong 
performance of our portables.
 
We're especially proud of our Mac results considering the overall contracti
on 
of the global PC market this year and we achieved our highest quarterly 
market share since 1995.
 
We also set an all
-
time record for the App Store revenue, thanks to the 
tremendous momentum and ongoing success of our developer community. 
App Store revenu
e grew 36% over last year and cumulative app downloads 
have now topped 85 billion.
 
These results bring to a close a record breaking fiscal 2014. Over the last 
four quarters, our products and services have generated a $183 billion in 
revenues, an 
increase of $12 billion over last year. We sold 243 million iOS 
devices and 19 million Macs, both all
-
time highs.
 
Our revenue from iTunes software and services reached $18 billion, which 
was more than the annual sales of two thirds of the companies in the 
Fortune 500 and we generated $6.45 in earnings per share, which is 14% 
higher than last year and also set a new record.
 
We made big investments in our business and have continued to expand our 
global footprint. Today we have 437 Apple retail stores in 15 c
ountries and 
our partners are selling Apple products in hundreds of thousands of locations 
around the world.
 
We're continuing to invest in developing markets where revenues 
approached $50 million in fiscal year '14, up 16% over last year and twice 
the rate
 
of growth of the company overall.
 
We [forged] (ph) a landmark partnership with IBM to provide a new 
generation of mobile enterprise application designed with our products 
legendary ease of use and backed by IBM's cloud services and data 
analytics.
 
Our par
tnership aims to redefine the way work is done, address key industry 
mobility challenges and sparked true mobile
-
led business change.
 
Developer teams have been working closely to develop the first wave of 
Mobile First solutions and these solutions will be 
ready for customers 
beginning next month across six sectors; banking, government, insurance, 
retail, travel and transportation and telecommunication.
 
We brought tremendous new talent and technology into Apple through 20 
acquisitions in fiscal '14 including
 
seven alone in the September quarter. We 
closed the Beats transition in July and we're off to a great start with some 
wonderful plans we'll share with you in the future.
 
Our strong results continue to generate significant cash and we're extremely 
happy th
at this has enabled us to make substantial investments in Apple's 
future, while retaining 
--
 
while returning cash to our shareholders.
 
We had executed aggressively against our share repurchase program, 
spending $17 billion in the September quarter alone an
d $45 billion in the 
last year.
 
In addition to Apple's strong business performance over the past four 
quarters, I am incredibly proud of all of our work to protect the environment, 
to advance human rights, to improve working conditions in the supply chain 
and to change the way teachers teach and students learn.
 
I'd like to thank all of our customers, employees, developers and business 
partners for making fiscal 2014 Apple's best year yet and I'd like to thank all 
of our shareholders for their continued supp
ort. I could not be more excited 
about the road ahead in fiscal 2015.
 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our September 
quarter results in more detail.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the September
 
quarter we generated record revenue of $42.1 billion, an increase $4.7 
billion or 12% year
-
over
-
year. These results exceeded our guidance range 
due to better than expected sales of iPhones and Macs for which customer 
demand grew strongly year
-
over
-
year in
 
all our segments.
 
Gross margin was 38% at the high end of the guidance range, operating 
margin was $11.2 billion representing 26.5% of revenue. Net income was 
$8.5 billion, a new September quarter record translating to diluted earnings 
per share of $1.42,
 
a 20% year
-
over
-
year increase. Cash flow from 
operations was very strong, a $13.3 billion, also a new Q4 record.
 
For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 39.3 million iPhones, 
an increase of 5.5 million over last year or 16% growth. Under
lying demand 
was even stronger with sell
-
through growth of 26%.
 
iPhone sales grew across both developed and emerging markets. Unit sales 
in the U.S. grew 17% year
-
over
-
year, and in Western Europe they were up 
20%. We saw even stronger growth in Latin Ameri
ca and the Middle East 
with sales up more than 50% and in Central and Eastern Europe where sales 
more than doubled.
 
We increased iPhone channel inventory by just under one million units 
during the September quarter this year, significantly less than the 3.
3 
million unit increase in the September quarter a year ago.
 
Based on the very strong demand for our new iPhones, this left us below our 
target range of four to six weeks for channel inventory on a look forward 
basis.
 
iPhone momentum in enterprise market r
emains very strong. The latest data 
published by IDC indicates that iPhone have 69% share of the U.S. 
commercial smartphone market.
 
Also, In August ChangeWave survey of U.S. corporate IT buyers found that 
among those planning to purchase smartphones in the
 
December quarter 
75% plan to purchase iPhones. An iPhone continues to fuel innovation of 
companies around the world.
 
Schindler, a leading global escalator and elevator manufacturer has deployed 
over 20,000 iPhones and 20 customer apps to improve customer 
engagements for safety and to allow service technicians to access vital 
documentation, repair and safety functions when they are in the field.
 
Baidu,
 
China's
 
top search provider currently has over 20,000 employees 
using iPhones and the company has develope
d over 30 in
-
house iOS apps to 
help its employees work more efficiently, track sales leads and manage 
internal IT infrastructure and processes.
 
Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an 
increase of almost a million over last ye
ar. That represents 21% growth 
year
-
over
-
year and an all
-
time quarterly record. We saw great demand in 
the back
-
to
-
school season for both desktops and portables with especially 
strong growth for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.
 
We achieved double
-
digit Mac gro
wth across most markets around the 
world, with particularly impressive performance in emerging markets where 
Mac sales were up 46%.
 
These results are truly remarkable given the contraction in the global PC 
market and we now gain market share for 33 of the 
last 34 quarters. We 
ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five 
week target range.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold 12.3 million units compared to 14.1 million in the 
September quarter last year. In anticipation of our October new
 
product 
announcement we reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end 
of the June quarter, which left us within our target range of channel 
inventory on a look
-
back basis.
 
iPad sales were consistent with our expectations and we 
experienced very 
strong results in Japan where iPad sales were up 46% year
-
over
-
year. 
Customers continue to love their iPads. In an August survey by ChangeWave 
iPad Mini with retina display earned an incredible 100% satisfaction rate, 
and among consumers p
lanning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, the 
survey indicated a 55% plan to buy an iPad.
 
We continue to see some momentum in enterprise for iPad. Progressive IT 
organizations around the world continue to deploy, manage and develop 
amazing in
-
house apps
 
for iPad.
 
Healthcare leader Sanofi has over 25,000 iPads and over 450 in
-
house apps 
for sales teams and corporate employees to get their products and 
information into the hands of doctors and other healthcare providers.
 
Premium eyewear designer Luxottica 
has deployed over 10,000 iPads to 
improve how customers experience the size, fit and overall look of eyewear 
in a retail environment. Importantly, since the announcement of the 
partnership with IBM hundreds of corporations around the world have 
expressed i
nterest in MobileFirst solutions and we are actively working with 
over 50 of them to become foundational client for MobileFirst solutions in 
their industries.
 
iPad continues to lead the U.S. education tablet market with 90% share 
based on the latest data f
rom IDC. In the September quarter the St. Paul 
public school in Minnesota purchased over 22,000 iPad Airs and over 5,000 
iPad Minis in the first race of the district's personalized learning through 
technology plan that will ultimately equip every student w
ith an iPad.
 
We are fully consistent and continue to strive. Our item store generated all 
time record billings of $5.4 billion in the September quarter, up 22% year
-
over
-
year, thanks to the tremendous momentum of the app store. 
Developers around the world 
have embraced the iOS platform and keep 
broadening the appeal of our thoughtfully designed app store to a large, 
loyal and engaged customer base.
 
Across all of our programs the number of registered app developers has 
grown by 22% in the last year and we ar
e rapidly approaching 10 million. 
We are seeing especially strong interest in the enterprise with a number of 
registered developers is up 39% over a year ago.
 
Our retail stores also generated strong results. Revenue for the quarter was 
$5.1 billion, up 15%
 
from a year ago and a new September quarter record. 
We opened 10 new stores and completed the remodels of three stores 
during the quarter ending with a total of 437 stores, 41% of which are 
outside the United States.
 
We are projecting a total of approxima
tely 25 new store openings in fiscal 
'15, about three quarters of which will be outside the U.S. We also plan to 
remodel about five stores over the course of the year.
 
With an average of 432 stores opened in the September quarter average 
revenue per store 
was $11.9 million compared to $10.9 million in the year 
ago quarter. We hosted 102 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, 
which translates to over 18,000 visitors per store per week.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter wi
th $155.2 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $9.3 billion. 
We are continue to execute our capital return program aggressively with the 
total spend of over $20 billion in just the September quarter.
 
We launched our fourth ac
celerated share repurchase program at the end of 
August spending $9 billion. We also spent $8 billion to repurchase $81 
million Apple's shares to open market transactions, paid $2.8 billion in 
dividends and equivalence and utilized over $300 million to net
 
share sell 
vesting employee RSUs.
 
So, we've already taken action on over $94 billion of our $130 billion capital 
return program including $68 billion in share repurchases with five quarters 
remaining to its completion. We remained firmly committed to our 
objective 
of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both business 
performance and return of capital.
 
As we said before, we review our capital allocation regularly. We have 
solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in
 
the 
past and we will continue to do so. We plan to report on our conclusions in a 
timeframe similar to last year.
 
Now, as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our 
outlook which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that 
Nancy 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$63.5 billion and $66.5 billion compared to $57.6 billion in the year ago 
quarter.
 
This represents a double
-
digit revenue increase despite significant foreign 
exchange headwind
s from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against 
most currencies. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. 
We expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion. We expect OI&E 
to be about $325 million and we expect the tax rate
 
to be about 26.5%.
 
Also today our Board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share 
payable on November 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of November 
10, 2014.
 
With that, I will hand it over to Nancy for some final remarks.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks,
 
Luca. We'd like to let you know about some reporting changes that 
we'll be making beginning with the release of our Q1 '15 results.
 
First, to better serve our customers and optimize our results around the 
world we are collaborating like never before acros
s our direct and indirect 
channels.
 
Accordingly, beginning in Q1 '15, we'll be including the results of our retail 
stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located providing a 
consolidated view of regional performance that is consistent with 
the way 
our executive team measures the business.
 
This means that going forward our reportable segment will be Americas, 
Europe, Greater China, Japan and the rest of Asia
-
Pacific with the retail no 
longer classified as a segment.
 
Second, to better reflect 
our evolving products and services, we'll be making 
some changes to our product summary reporting. We will continue to report 
iPhone, iPad and Macs as separate line items and we'll also have a category 
that we refer to as services and this will encompass e
verything we report 
under the heading of iTunes software and services today including content, 
apps, licensing and other services and beginning this month it will also 
include Apple Pay.
 
We'll be creating a new reporting category called other products. Thi
s will 
encompass everything we report in the accessories category today including 
Beats headphones and speakers, Apple TV and peripherals and accessories 
for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod.
 
In addition, we will begin to include iPod sales in the other products
 
category 
and we will also reflect sales of Apple Watch in this line item once it begins 
shipping in early calendar 2015.
 
So to recap, beginning in Q1 '15. our products reporting categories will be 
iPhone, iPad, Mac, services and other products. We wanted 
to give analysts 
and investors a heads up on these plans so you can reflect them in your 
models accordingly.
 
We'll also reclassify historical results to be consistent with these newer 
groupings and we'll provide that information on our Investor Relations 
w
ebsite when we release Q1 results.
 
And finally, our distribution channels have evolved and expanded 
significantly in the last couple of years including traditional resellers, 
consumer electronic stores, mass retailers, distributors and carriers, and 
each of these channels have the different distribution model. Today, iPhone 
is sold in over 200,000 locations around the world and iPad is sold in more 
than 100,000.
 
In addition, revenue from emerging markets has increased considerably over 
the last few ye
ars and now accounts for over quarter of our sales. And 
channel inventory requirements in those markets tend to be much longer.
 
So, due to the size, complexity and different needs of our channels around 
the world we've determined that a five to seven week 
average range for 
both iPhone and iPad channel inventory is more appropriate and that will be 
our target range going forward. However, given the backlog for our new 
products, we expect to exit the December quarter within our old four to six 
weeks target ra
nge.
 
So with that let's open the call to questions and we ask that you please limit 
yourself to one one
-
part question and one follow
-
up.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Shannon Cross 
with Cros
s Research.
 
Shannon Cross

Cross Research
 
Thank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question is with regard to 
Apple Pay, which we actually used this afternoon and where it was rolled out 
it actually worked pretty well which was nice, but could you pr
ovide some 
more color, Tim and Luca, on how you see the business model for Apple?
 
And maybe from a high level perspective, if you see there's more over time 
becoming a standalone business like you look at iTunes, or is this more just 
a way to sell incremen
tal product?
 
Tim Cook
 
Shannon, hi, it's Tim. The 
--
 
what we wanted to achieve with Apple Pay was 
first and foremost to have an incredible consumer experience. And so we 
focused very much on making it elegant and simple and hopefully your trails 
have proven
 
them. I know I used it over the weekend and it worked 
fantastically.
 
We also wanted to focus on security and privacy, and so we see huge issues 
with the security of the traditional credit card system. And many people that 
have entered mobile payments are 
doing still in a way that they want to 
monetize the data that they collect from the customers and we think 
customers in general do not want this that they'd like to keep their data 
private. And so, we wanted to have ease of use, security and privacy and 
ma
ximize all three.
 
By doing so, we think we will sell more devices because we think it's a killer 
feature. It's far better than reaching in your pocket book and trying to find 
the card that you're looking for and half the time it's not working.
 
There 
--
 
we 
do not charge the customer for the benefit. We do not charge 
the merchant for the benefit. However, there are commercial terms between 
Apple and the issuing banks, but we're not disclosing what they are, like any 
other contractual arrangement those are pri
vate things.
 
And so as Nancy was saying in her closing comments, we'll be reporting 
Apple Pay in the services line item on the data sheet. And so, we see it as an 
incredible service that is the most customer
-
centric mobile payment system 
that there is. And
 
we are very proud of it and can't wait to sign up more 
retailers and also extend it around the world.
 
Shannon Cross 
-
 
Cross Research
 
Thank you. And then, Luca, if you could talk a little bit about the impact of 
currency. In IBM's results this morning they
 
talked substantially about 
potential pressure going forward from currency. So could you walk us 
through how your hedges work, how we should think about currency and 
how you reflected in at least the current quarter guidance?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yeah. Definitely,
 
Shannon. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened 
quite significantly against most currencies in recent weeks. When we looked 
at our Q4 results actually the impact was fairly limited combination of the 
hedging program and the fact that the dollar rea
lly strengthened towards the 
very end of the quarter.
 
Not much impact in Q4. It is becoming a significant headwind in Q1 both on 
a year
-
over
-
year basis and on a sequential basis.
 
As I said before, we have reflected the new FX situation at current levels in
to 
our guidance that we provided for both revenue and gross margins. And it's 
a fact of life if the U.S. dollar strengthens, that creates a headwind for us 
both in revenue and margins for our business outside the United States.
 
As you know, we have a compr
ehensive hedging program in place that 
mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. Over time, of course, these 
hedges roll off and get replaced by new hedges at new spot levels, and so 
the protection that you get from hedging program is temporary. But again,
 
the guidance that we provided fully reflects that current situation in the FX 
markets.
 
Shannon Cross 
-
 
Cross Research
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Shannon, can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
And from Goldman Sachs we'll hear from Bill 
Shope.
 
Bill Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. Thank you. Could you comment on how we should think about the key 
swing factors for gross margins in the December quarter, obviously outside 
the FX impact you just mentioned, Luca?
 
And more broadly, I know it's still
 
early, but how should we think about the 
gross margin path as the iPhone 6 family ramps versus what we saw with 
the 5S and 5C cycle. I guess you can answer that specifically. I'm trying to 
figure out if you characterize this as a fairly normal cycle in te
rms of 
expected cost improvements over the life of the product.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, Bill let me start with put and takes of margins for Q1. I would say that 
on the positive we are so pleased with the launch of new phones you might 
have seen phenomenal. So we
 
think we're going to be getting favorable 
impact from iPhone mix.
 
Of course, we're also going to be getting some positive leverage from the 
higher revenues that we guided to and we continue to see fairly favorable 
commodity environment. So these are the t
hings that are on the positive 
side.
 
On the negative side I've talked about FX. Obviously we have launched a lot 
of new products even in the last six weeks and we've got transition costs as 
we move from current products to new products and that tends to be
 
a 
headwind.
 
And every time we launch new products, we make them better and what 
that means is that our cost structures tend to go up when we produce new 
products. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures 
down over time and so when 
you take the positives and negatives that I 
have just mentioned that is what gives us the guidance that we just 
provided.
 
Bill Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay great. And then my second question is, looking at that current supply 
constraints of the iPhone, could
 
you confirm that your guidance is assuming 
you will reach supply demand balance before the end of the quarter, I think 
that's what was implied by your commentary on channel inventory?
 
And related to that, could you give us some more color on what you see 
as 
the key bottlenecks at this point for supply on the iPhone side?
 
Tim Cook
 
Bill its Tim. The ramp itself is going great. The chances are ever in our 

obstructing supply. It is uncle
ar looking at the data when supply will catch 
up with demand.
 

to get to a supply
-
demand balance on both of the new products this quarter 

 
It'
s very difficult to gauge demand without first achieving finding the balance 
and it's clear that as of today, and certainly as of the end of the quarter 
where you're looking at the data, we're not nearly, we're not close, we're not 
on the same plan.
 
And 
--
 
but that said, I am really confident that supply is going to be great 
and that's the reason you see incredibly strong guidance that we're giving 
from $63.5 billion to $66.5 billion.
 
At 
--
 
but at this point, it's just very difficult to gauge what the true 
demand 
is. When you see it's very unusual to see every country having a marked 
improvement over the previous year and that's what we're seeing on iPhone.
 

comment at the end was meant to t
ell you that we do not envision as of 
today being able to achieve the extra inventory in the channel that we 
believe is needed when you think about the long food chains in some of the 
emerging markets where the distribution channels are not as official, so
 
that's the purpose of that comment.
 
Bill Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay, that's helpful, thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Bill. Can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
We'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan 
Stanley
 
Thanks. Luca I wonder if you can quantify the currency headwind on gross 
margin in the December quarter, just because there is a big focus on 
currency across tech right now and should we expect price harmonization if 
the dollar remained 
strong? And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Katy, it's you know I said that there's headwinds from foreign exchange are 
going to be significant. So 
--
 
and I would tell you that they are more 
significant when you look at it from a year
-
over
-
year basis
 
that it is on a 
sequential basis because clearly the dollar has been strengthening for quite 
a while particularly against certain currencies like the Yen or the Canadian 
dollar a lot of the emerging market currencies. So it's again impact and 
that's the r
eason why we wanted to call it out.
 
Katy Huberty 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Will you do any price harmonization if the dollar remained strong?
 
Luca Maestri
 
No, we price our products in a way that is in general reflective of pricing 
here in the United States and it's
 
a pricing that we want to keep in place for 
reasonable periods of time. We do not like to make sudden changes to our 
pricing.
 
Katy Huberty 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay, then as a follow up, I wonder if you can comment on the how NAND 
capacity and SKU mix is trac
king versus your expectations for iPhone 6?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yeah Katy, it's Tim. At this point, we're selling everything we made. And so 
it's difficult to say that we've been 
--
 
that we've absolutely made it well on 
the SKU mix and the split between the iPhone 6 
and the 6 Plus.
 
From everything we can tell, we've done a pretty good job on that. But I'll 
stop short of saying there is no issue at all, because it's hard to tell when 
you are at a point where you are selling everything you are making. It is a 
good probl
em to have.
 
Katy Huberty 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Got it, congrats on the quarter.
 
Tim Cook
 
Thank you, very much, thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Katy. Can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
From Sanford Bernstein we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi. And Toni y
ou may 
want to check your mute button.
 
Toni Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Yes, sorry about that. I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca the 
question for you is a bit of a follow up from the last one which is that we saw 
a pretty robust sequentia
l increase in ASPs this quarter in the iPhone and I 
was wondering if you could qualitatively help us understand whether that 
was a higher mix of new phones than you typically see in the September 
quarter or was it really a function of the new phones having
 
a richer ASP?
 
And if we look forward to calendar fiscal Q1, last year you had a very 
substantial ASP increase, should we be thinking about a similar kind of ASP 
increase this quarter given I think a widespread belief that availability on the 
6 Plus has be
en even more constrained and that we could see a much higher 
percentage of 6 Plus as a percentage of total iPhones shipped in the quarter 
and next quarter?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes Toni. So, on a sequential basis our ASPs for iPhone were up $42. And as 
you said co
rrectly the reason for the increase was a higher mix of the new 
iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
 
There was a partial offset in the quarter from the transition cost that we 
incurred typically when we moved to a new product.
 
Going forward obviously, the percentage of ne
w iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will 
increase sequentially as we are going to have the full quarter available to us 
and it's correct that iPhone 6 Plus is supply constrained right now.
 
Toni Sacconaghi

Okay and then Tim for you, I was 
wondering again qualitatively if you could 
help us understand what you think the mix of repeat buyers is for iPhone 6 
let's say over the next year versus first time iPhone customers.
 
And you know the question in that is, do you believe that because the 
iPh
one 6 is so compelling that that traditional replacement cycle might be 

do you in the future run reversion back towards in the elongating of that 
replacement cycle in future gen
erations?
 
Tim Cook
 
It is difficult to answer exactly, but let me sort of back up and give you some 
data, maybe that will help frame the topic. So if you look at some of our top 
countries and how they did in the mid year of selling a customer the first 
iPho
ne they had ever bought.
 
What you would see is that in countries like China over 80% of the people 
that we were selling the 4s2 were buying the first iPhone ever in the U.S. it 
was over 60%.
 
And so those kind of give you some goalpost of large countries in
 
terms of 
first time ownership at our entry level. As you step across and look at the 
5s, which was at that time the top end phone, in China still almost half the 
people were buying their first iPhone ever buying try this and about a 
quarter of the U.S. po
pulation buying a 5s or buying their first one.
 
So that kind of gives you some goalpost and so, the way I look at those 
numbers are, that on a forward basis what would I expect, obviously we 

airly large 
opportunity in people buying their first iPhone ever and I think with these 
products that we just announced with 6 and 6 Plus that opportunity 
increases not decreases.
 
I also believe that the upgrade market for people that were waiting for 6, f
or 
iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, as we can see from our order backlog that number is 
huge. And so I would expect that to go on for some period of time because 
you have people that time out of contract at different time, no everybody 
does that at launch time.
 
And so 
I see both the first time buyer being a great opportunity and the up
-
grader. Some of the first time buyers are people that have never owned a 
smartphone before and some of them are switchers from android.
 
And so, right now, everything, all of those look ve
ry good to us, but we're in 
the early going and we're selling everything we're making and so it's going 
to take some period of time before we have a better handle on what those 
numbers will look like in steady state. But I've never felt so great after a 
la
unch before, maybe that's the best way to summarized it all.

Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Toni. Can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
From UBS we'll hear from Steven Milunovich.
 
Steven Milunovich 
-
 
UBS
 
Thanks.
 
Is there more color you can give us on the mix of 6 and 6 Plus, 
particularly to the degree you see it in the order book? Our book suggests 
it's maybe 2.5 to 1, 6 to 6 Plus in the U.S., but and maybe that 
geographically it's quite different. Asia may be go
ing for the bigger screen is 
there any color you can give us?
 
Tim Cook
 
Steve, there's not a lot of color that I can give that I feel is terribly accurate 
because as I said before, we're selling everything we're making and so 
essentially what our current se
ll through looks like is our current supply.
 
And so in the long arc of time, once there is enough supply to meet demand 
that mix might look differently. Digits clear or at least I think that we will 
see a difference by geography in terms of preference and 
we thought that 
going into the launch of 
--
 
and there's no data that we perceived to date that 
would suggest that, that's not the case and so that's all about all I can say 
at this point.
 
Steven Milunovich

UBS
 
Okay. And then regarding the strength in Mac
 
and the weakness in iPad I 
guess, what's the message from the market that you take away from that 
and does that perhaps at all affect your view of doing a convertible type 
product which in the past has not kind of an Apple's approach, you tend to 
like to 
do very focused products there might be that there is something in 
between that could be quite successful?
 
Tim Cook
 
Let me comment on both the Mac and the iPad. On the Mac it was just 
absolutely blow
-
away order. Our best ever, it will result in our highest
 
market share since 1995. It's just absolutely stunning.
 
Get back
-
to
-
school season voted and the Mac 1 and carried the day and 
we're really proud of that. I'm proud of the Mac team. It's clear that the 
--
 
all the work that we've put into our Notebooks, on 
the hardware and the 
software side is resonating with our customers and I think if you went out to 
college campuses about now, you will see a lot of Mac and there are lot of 
new Mac Notebooks there based on the sales.
 
And so that feels fantastic being up 2
1% in that market that's shrinking it 
just 
--
 

 
For iPad, if I take a step back on iPad, and I know that there is a lot of 
negative commentary in the market on this, but I have a little different 
perspective on it. Here's sor
t of my simple perspective.
 
If you look at, instead of looking at this thing each 90 days, if you back up 
and look at it, we've sold 237 million in just over four years. That's about 
twice the number of iPhones that we sold over the first four years of 
iPhone.
 
If you look at the last 12 months of iPad, we sold 68 million in '13, in fiscal 
year '13 we sold 71 million. So we were down, but we were down 4% on sell 
in and the sell
-
through was a bit better than the negative 4 because we took 
down channel inve
ntories. And so, to me I view it as a speed bob, not a 
huge issue.
 

things and so, looking further in the data, I know that there is a popular 
view that the market is saturated, but we do

other people but I do look at our data deeply.
 
And in the last market research data we have is in the June quarter, and let 
me give you some of this 
--
 
the real data that we've got. is that if you look 
at our top six revenue 

percentage of iPads to people who had never bought an iPad before that 
number is 50%.
 
And the range goes from 50 to over 70. And so when I look at number, our 
first time buyer rates in that area, it is satur
ated, that's not a saturated 
market. You never have first time buyer rates at 50% and 70%. What you 
do see is that people hold on to iPad longer than they do a phone.
 

know what the up
grade cycle will be for people. And so that's a difficult thing 
to call.
 
What we do know is that people always respond for us doing great products 
and we feel really great about what we introduced last week. We also know 
that the deeper the Apps go in the 
enterprise, the more it opens up avenues 
in enterprise and that's a key part of the IBM partnership and what I think 
customers will get out of that, which is more important than our selling is 
changing the right people who work.
 
And so I see catalyst going
 
forward. There are obvious cannibalization; 
things that are occurring. I'm sure that some people looked at the Mac and 

am sure that will be just looking at the numbers and I am fi
ne with that by 
the way.
 
I am sure that some people will look at an iPad and an iPhone and decide 
just to get an iPhone and I'm fine with that as well. But over the long arc of 
time, my own judgment is that iPad has a great future, healthy individual 
90
-
da

take iPad over time and so we're continuing to invest in the product pipeline.
 
We're continuing to invest in distribution. If you look at how we did in 
emerging markets like BRIC countrie
s as an example, we were up 20% for 
the full year of '14. And so these numbers are impressive and obviously the 
BRIC countries are growing as a percentage of our total as is developing 
markets.
 
And so, it looks a bit different geography to geography, and s

answer to your question, but I thought it was important for you to at least 
share my perspective and you can judge it as you will.

Thanks.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Steve. Can we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
And we'll hear from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
 
Ben Reitzes

Barclays
 
Hey, thanks a lot. Tim, I was wondering what we were to make out of your 
new segments with the Apple Watch being in the other category. We were 
just a little surprised to hear that becau
se it seems like such a substantial 
new category and you could sell may be even tens of millions of unit.
 
So by putting it lumped in the other with iPods and a lot of other things, 
does that say something about your expectations for that product or do you 
think that you'll just break it out after a little while?
 
Tim Cook
 
Probably it says nothing about our expectation for the product. We didn't 
form those categories based on expectations. We looked at current revenue, 
today revenue, and decided that we would
 

Mac, an iPad, or an iPhone or a service in one kind of category.
 
In the future, we might decide something different, but for now, in Q1 we're 
not shipping any iPhone or excuse me, Apple Watches and so it seems 
appropriate to 
start it that way.
 
And also to be also straight is I am not very anxious in reporting a lot of 
numbers on Apple Watch because of the 
--
 
and giving a lot of detail on it 
because our competitors are looking for it and so aggregating it is helpful 
from that p
oint of view as well.
 
Ben Reitzes 
-
 
Barclays
 
Okay. Got it. And then with regard to my next question is you put out a lot 
of products and we obviously everybody gives you a lot of credit for the 
great new product lineup that we have, but everybody talks abo
ut what's 
next.
 
You said in an interview recently on TV that you were working on products 
that people didn't even speculate on yet and that's pretty hard with Apple 
considering how many people watch your company and write about it.
 
So I was just wondering 
if you could elaborate on that may be in terms of 
your excitement around new products and what did you mean by that 
comment and how do you feel about the future in light of that comment you 
made? Thanks a lot.
 
Tim Cook
 
I am incredibly optimistic about 
the future. We've already announced two 
new categories in the last 60 days or so or less than 60 days with Apple Pay 
and Apple Watch. So shipping the watch early next year and obviously we're 
working on other things as well and to the degree that I can kee
p that in the 
cone of silence, I am going to do it and so I am not sure what to say.
 
I am not going to give any answer or anything. We look at a lot of different 
things and we're fortunate to have a lot of creative people here that want to 
change the world
 
and have a lot of great ideas.
 
Ben Reitzes

Barclays
 
All right. Thanks Tim.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks. And could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
 
Gene Munster 
-
 
Piper Jaffray
 
Hey, good afternoon. A follow
-
up to Ben's question in terms of the last year 
you had higher expectations in terms of new product categories and the 
iPhone 6 launch but there are some investors who think about Apple and a 
products type of story.
 
So Tim, I'd be interested in how you thin
k about the story broadly in 2015 
and kind of exciting things to be focused on as an investor and then I have a 
follow
-
up to Luca.
 
Tim Cook
 
Well for Apple if as an investor I would hope that people would look at what 
we've done and what we've delivered and
 
the power and strength of the 
product line that we've announced and maybe more importantly then all the 
stuff that you see, is to look at the skills within this company.
 
And the fact that I think it's the only company on the planet that has the 
ability to
 
integrate hardware and software and services at a world
-
class level 
and that in itself allows Apple to play in so many different areas and so the 
challenge becomes one of deciding which ones to say no to and which ones 
to say yes to and want to focus not 
once 
--
 
not once do we have any great 
ideas and we always had more ideas than we have resources to deal with.
 
And so I would look at that. I would look at what we talked about last week. 
Things like continuity and if you use your imagination and think abou
t where 
that goes, there is no other company that can do this. Apple is the only one 
and I think this becomes so incredibly important moving forward for 
customers living in an environment where they're using multiple devices.
 
And so I would look at the ski
lls, the capabilities, the passion of the company 
and the creative engine has never been stronger. And I think you can see 
that from the Apple Watch, you can see that with Apple Pay. Apple Pay is a 
classic app for taking something that is incredibly old, o
utdated, kludgy.
 
Everybody is focused on everything except for the customer and putting the 
customer at the center of the experience and making something very 
elegant. And so I would look at those things and when I look at those things, 
I would as an inves
tor, I feel great, as a personal investor I feel great.
 
Gene Munster 
-
 
Piper Jaffray
 
No. That's helpful. And a follow
-
up for Luca, you mentioned that you have 
typical transition costs that involve in new products you're rolling out. Do 
those costs start to
 
ease in the March quarter and would that presumably 
have a positive impact on gross margins in March versus December. Thanks.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, and you know pretty much what our product cadence is and what it's 
been in the past and you know that the holid
ay season is a period where we 
have significant product events and we're not providing any guidance for the 
March quarter.
 
And also keep in mind Gene if you're trying to extrapolate gross margins into 
the future, there are so many factors that affect gross
 
margin over time and 
it's not only transition cost, but its product mix, its foreign exchange, its 
commodity markets.
 
Gene Munster 
-
 
Piper Jaffray
 
Okay. Great. Thanks. Congratulations.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Gene. Could we have the 
next question please?
 
Operator
 
And from Bank of Montreal, we'll go to Keith Buckman.
 
Keith Buckman

Bank of Montreal
 
Hi, Tim, I was wondering if you could characterize China a little bit. The 
numbers I understand weren't as good as the rest of the company
 
this 
quarter but presumably that was all the delay of the iPhone.
 
So I'm really asking if you talk about the last few weeks and more 
importantly as you look at December quarter in particular related to some of 
the political backdrop including the carriers
 
have been mandated not to 
spend the same level of subsidies.
 
Do you see any of that impacting your opportunities for Apple broadly 
speaking but more specifically for iPhones as it relates to subsidy levels?
 
Tim Cook
 
That's a good question. If you 
--
 
if yo
u just 
--
 
if you look at Greater China 
Q4 of '14 compared to Q4 of '13, the obvious difference is that we launched 
the 5s in Q4 of '13 and in this year, we didn't have a new product launch. 
We were launching in this quarter in Q1 of '15.
 
The second thing t
hat's not as apparent probably, but is more related to that 
is that last year we increased our channel inventory by $1.3 million. This 
year, we actually decreased it slightly. And so you have a compounded effect 
of their launch and a huge change in channel
 
inventory on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis.
 
So the way that I assess the strength of the market is I look at unit sell
-
through and to share with you what it was in Greater China, iPhone unit sell 
through despite no launch in Q4 was up 32% year
-
over
-
year.
 
The mar
ket was projected by IDC to only grow 13%. So we feel incredibly 
great about that. Macs were up 54% year
-
over
-
year and that's against the 
IDC's estimate of the market contraction in China of 7% and so those are 
two stalwarts that were really driving result
s and so the underlying results 
look totally different than the reported results because of the channel 
inventory kind of differences.
 
The App Store in China is also doing great. The growth there is phenomenal. 
iPad concreted some during the quarter, but f
or the full year we did grow 
--
 
we were up 9% year
-
over
-
year for the full year and so I see lots of 
positives.
 
As you know China is on the early stages of their huge 4G rollout.
 
Keith Buckman 
-
 
Bank of Montreal
 
Yes.
 
Tim Cook
 
And this weekend 
--
 
this past w
eekend we launched it with China Mobile, 
China Unicom and China Telecom. This was the first time we've launched a 
new iPhone with all three carriers and we've done it at the early stages of 
the 4G rollout and so I am incredibly bullish over it.
 
In terms of
 
subsidies there are regulatory pressures on subsidies. We have 
-
-
 
we've seen that. However, only 20% of the iPhones that we've been selling 
in China have had a traditional subsidy applied to it and so the vast majority 
don't.
 
And so will it make a differe
nce with that 20%, I don't know yet. Intuitively 
you were thinking, it would, but it's at least a percentage of a 20% instead 
of a percentage of 100%.
 
And so when I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are 
more people graduating into the mid
dle class than any nation on earth in 
history and just an incredible market where people brought the latest 
technology and products that we were providing.
 
And so we're investing like crazy in the market. We're more than doubling 
our stores. We've got 15 i
n Greater China today. We're going to be close to 
40 in the next couple of years. We've expanded our online store to cover 
now 315 cities in China. The revenue results for Q4 were up more than 
double the previous year.
 
The App Store is growing. Chinese dev
elopers have now created a 150,000 
apps 
--
 
of the apps on the App Store and so I see lots of very, very positive 

 
Keith Buckman 
-
 
Bank of Montreal
 
Okay. And then as my follow
-
up if I could, Tim, you mentioned be
fore on a 
previous comment on iPad where you saw I think 50% to 70% in the top six 
countries were new buyers and related to a previous question, wondered if 
you could give that same range. I understand it's probably a pretty wide 
range for iPhones and that
 
was to the June quarter I think.
 
And broadly speaking, how does that number change at least your guess as 
you look out over the next couple quarters given the launch of the 6 and the 
6 Plus.
 
Tim Cook
 
For iPhone I really have it by model from the June quar
ter and as I had 
mentioned before, the highest percentage is the 4s buyer in China over 80% 
of the people were buying their first iPhone.
 
And for a 5s in China, 50% were and so I think what that says. Those 
numbers are so high, the 80 that I think are 
great 
--
 
my gut tells me, a 
great percentage of 6 and 6 Plus buyers will eventually 
--
 
a great percentage 
of those will be new to iPhone. That's what I would predict.

Tim Cook
 
Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us.
 
We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all
-
time 
records in both revenue and ear
nings. We generated revenue of $91.8 
billion, which is above the high
-
end of our guidance range, with revenue 
growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter. Geographically, we set 
all
-
time records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Specific a
nd saw 
Greater China return to growth.
 
Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter 
revenue was up 8% year
-
over
-
year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of 
double
-
digit growth outside of iPhone including a new all
-
time record for 
ser
vices and another blowout quarter for Wearables.
 
Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 
100 million in the last 12 months alone, reaching a new all
-
time high for 
each of our main product categories and geographic segmen
ts. Not only is 
our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the 
satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling 

category one by one.
 
On iPh

8% over a year ago, thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, 
iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. In fact, iPhone 11 was our top
-
selling 
model every week during the December q
uarter and the three new models 
were our three most popular iPhones.
 
We had double
-
digit growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., 
the UK, France and Singapore, and also grew double digits in emerging 
markets led by strong performances in Brazi
l, Mainland China, India, 
Thailand, and Turkey. These new models are by far the best iPhones we've 
ever shipped with advance technologies and unprecedented leap in battery 
life to easily get through the day and our best
-
in
-
class camera experience. 
We have 
been wild with the photos customers have shared in our all
-
new 
Night Mode photo challenge this month.
 
Turning to services. Q1 revenue reached $12.7 billion, an all
-
time record, 
growing 17% over last year. Once again, we saw double
-
digit growth in all 
five 
of our geographic segments and established new all
-
time records from 
multiple categories including cloud services, music, payment services and 
our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter 
record for the App Store and AppleCare.
 
2

some highlights. For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customers 
spending a new single day record $386 million on New Year's Day alone, a 
20% increase over last year. App
le Arcade, our new game subscription 
service has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and 

devices with new games and expansions added every month.
 
Apple TV+ is off t
o a rousing start, and I want to congratulate the entire 
team at The Morning Show for their multiple Golden Globe nomination. 
Jennifer Aniston on her Screen Actors Guild award and Billy Crudup on his 
Critics Choice award.
 
We continue to focus on telling st
ories that matter, like Little America, which 
recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim with much more great 
content still to come. Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active 
users in the U.S., UK, Australia and Canada, and provides a cur
ated and 
personalized experience using on
-
device intelligence to recommend stories. 
Apple News+ continues to add new titles, offering subscribers seamless 

 
For Apple Pay, revenue and transa
ctions more than doubled year
-
over
-
year 
with the run rate exceeding 15 billion transactions a year. Apple Pay transit 
support expanded with customers paying for journeys on transport for 
London more easily with Apple Pay Express Transit. And in spring of 2
020, 
iPhone and Apple Watch customers will be able to simply tap to ride trains 
and buses in even more cities including Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
 
We are thrilled with the continued growth at Apple Card. And last month, the 
customers began using Apple Card mo
nthly installments at Apple retail and 
online to purchase new iPhones and pay for them over 24 months. We see 
great promise for these recently launched services, and we're optimistic 
about what we've got in the pipeline for each of them.
 
Now, turning to We
arables. We had another incredible quarter, setting an 
all
-
time record in virtually every market we track around the world, and this 
product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company. Demand for 
AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for 
our recently launched 
AirPods Pro, our new addition to the AirPods family that features active noise 
cancellation.
 
Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all
-
time revenue 
record during the quarter. It continues to have a profound impact o
n our 

customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple 
Watch. Both AirPods and Apple Watch were must have holiday gifts, helping 
drive unprecedented results for 
the category, even as we face supply 
constraints for Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods Pro.
 
Mac and iPad generated $7.2 billion and $6 billion in revenue, respectively, 
and the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products 
drove the acti
ve installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all 
geographic segments.
 
For iPad, we saw growth in key emerging markets like Mexico, India, Turkey, 
Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, with our current 
line
-
up of iPad Pro, iPa
d Air, iPad Mini and iPad, along with the new iPadOS 
will give the customers an unparalleled tablet experience integrating 
hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can.
 
This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our mo
st 
powerful notebook ever. The 16
-
inch MacBook Pro, as well as Mac Pro and 
Pro Display XDR, the most powerful tools Apple has ever put into hands of 

from developers, photographers and mu
sic producers to filmmakers and 

 
We also want to take a moment to congratulate all the Grammy winning and 
nominated artists this past weekend who rely on Logic Pro 10 and the Mac to 
create inc
redible music we all love.
 
I want to call out and celebrate the exceptional work of our retail and online 
teams. This quarter, we opened a beautiful new store in Kawasaki, Japan. 
And exciting things are taking place inside each and every store. Thanks in 
p
art to a doubling in iPhone trade
-
ins versus last year, our retail and online 
stores set an all
-
time record and delivered strong double
-
digit growth in 
iPhone. We see a very bright future for these efforts and we continue to 
innovate to ensure that everyon
e who visits an Apple retail location has a 
great experience.
 
We began 2020 with our greatest product line
-
up ever and we are only 
deepening our commitment to do our part to make the world a better place. 
In November, we released a completely redesigned Ev
eryone Can Code 
curriculum to help introduce more elementary and middle school students to 
the world of coding. The new curriculum includes even more resources for 
teachers, a brand new guide for students and updates Swift Coding Club 
materials. Today, mil
lions of students in more than 5,000 schools worldwide 
use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop 
important skills, including creativity, collaboration, and problem
-
solving.
 
November also saw the launch of our new 
research app, the latest in our 
ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user. 
Customers in the U.S. can enroll in three landmark multiyear health studies 

A
pple Women's Health Study, the Apple Heart And Movement Study and the 
Hearing Study, as in everything we do, we build user privacy into the 
research app from the ground up.
 
This quarter we also announced a $2.5 billion plan to help address the 
housing avai
lability and affording crisis in our home state of California. We 
feel a great responsibility to help the region we have always called home 
stay vibrant and to ensure that it remains a great place for everyone to live 
and raise a family, including those wh
o do so much to serve the community, 
like firefighters and teachers.
 

coronavirus. We're donating two groups that are working to contain the 
outbreak, we're working closely with our Ap
ple team members and partners 
in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across 
the region.

-
breaking December quarter, we are 
already well underway on some new and exciting developments for the 

innovation, and this year will be no different. But for now, for more details 
on the results, I would like to turn the call over to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, ever
yone.
 
Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were 
exceptional as we set new all
-
time records for revenue, net income and 
earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up $7.5 
billion or 9% from a year ago, in spite 
of a $1 billion headwind from foreign 
exchange. Geographically, we established all
-
time revenue records in many 
major developed and emerging markets including, among others, the U.S., 
Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, 
T
hailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.
 
Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone returned to growth, 
and we had incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all
-
time 
records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Services revenue grew 17% to a 
new all
-
time record, $12.7 billion with double
-
digit growth in every 
geographic segment and new all
-
time records across our portfolio.
 
Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven 
by leverage from higher revenue, despite of a negative 60
 
basis
-
point 
impact from foreign exchange.
 
Products gross margin was 34.2%, up 260 basis points sequentially, thanks 
to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 
basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax 
rate for 
the quarter was 14.2%. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly 
in line with our guidance. A favorable one
-
time item impacted the rate by 
230 basis points.
 
Net income was an all
-
time record of $22.2 billion, up $2.3 billion or 11% 
over l
ast year. Diluted EPS was also an all
-
time record at $4.99, up 19% and 
operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 
billion over a year ago.
 
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone 
revenue of $5
6 billion grew 8% year
-
over
-
year, as we saw a great customer 
response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all
-
time revenue 
records in several countries, including the U.S. Mexico, the UK, France, 
Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.
 
Our a
ctive installed base of iPhones has reached an all
-
time high and is 
growing in each of our geographic segments. In the U.S., the latest survey 
of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 
98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max
 
combined. Among business 
buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to 
purchase iPhones.
 
Turning to services. We set an all
-
time revenue record of $12.7 billion with 
double
-
digit growth in all of our five geographic segments. As
 
Tim 
mentioned, we established new all
-
time records for Apple Music, cloud 
services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and 
December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. We are well on 
our way to accomplishing our goal of dou

revenue during 2020. We've actually already reached that goal on a run
-
rate 
basis with the results of the December quarter.
 
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number 
of both, transacting and pa
id accounts on our digital content stores reached 
a new all
-
time high with paid accounts growing double digits in all of our 
geographic segments. We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions 
across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a yea
r ago. And at 
this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark 
already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we're 
experiencing across our services offerings, we're increasing our target for 
paid subscriptions and 
aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 
2020.
 
App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer 
demand for both in
-
app purchases and subscriptions. Our third
-
party 
subscription business grew across multiple categories and i
ncreased almost 
40% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Our first
-
party subscription services also continued to perform extremely 
well. Apple Music set an all
-
time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 
60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all
-
time 
revenue 
record, growing very
-
strong double digits while offering our customers a 
safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices. It was a 
December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement 
attach rates and expanded dis
tribution, many of our partners have come to 
appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand and our ability to deliver the 
very
-
best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both 
our partners and our customers, and we are very happy to s
ee that quality 
of experience delivered to more and more of our users.
 

iPad revenue was $6 billion. Both products had a difficult year
-
over
-
year 
comparison due to the launches of M
acBook Air here, Mac mini and iPad Pro 
during the December quarter a year ago and the subsequent channels fill. 
Despite the tough compare, on a demand basis, our performance for both 
Mac and iPad was around even to last year.
 
Importantly, around half of th
e customers purchasing Macs and iPads around 
the world during the quarter, were new to that product. And the active 
installed base of both Mac and iPad reached a new all
-
time high. The most 
recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfact
ion 
rating for iPad from consumers and 92% from businesses, and among both 
consumers and businesses were planning to purchase tablets in the March 
quarter 78% plan to purchase iPads.
 
Wearables, home and accessories established a new all
-
time record with 
re
venue of $10 billion, up 37% year
-
over
-
year with very strong double
-
digit 
performance across all five geographic segments and growth across 
Wearables, accessories and home. We set all
-
time records for Wearables in 
virtually every market we track, even as w
e experience some product 
shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and 
AirPods during the quarter.
 
We also continued to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise 
market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do
 
their best work. 
100% of Fortune 500 companies in the healthcare sector use Apple 
technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and 
nursing workflows, and we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector 
drive innovation with o
ur technology and apps. One example is Gauss 
Surgical, which uses Core ML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss 
during child birth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and 
timely information on whether a patient needs an interventi
on, which can 
impact both, clinical outcomes and costs.
 
Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company, which 
makes handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable 
clinicians to take an ultrasound anywhere at a cost th
at is dramatically lower 
than other solutions in the market today.
 
Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $207 
billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued a 2 billion euro
-
denominated green bond, retired $1 billion of ma
turing debt and reduced 
commercial paper by $1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt 
of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter 
and we maintained our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over
 
time.
 
We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. 
We began a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, 
resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also 
repurchased 40 mill
ion Apple shares for $10 billion, through open market 
transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we 
have done for the last several years, we would share our plans for the next 
phase of our capital return program when we report 
results for the March 
quarter.
 
Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our 
outlook, which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Tejas 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$6
3 billion and $67 billion. The wider than usual revenue range 
comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health 
situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. 
We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 b
illion. We expect OI&E 
to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.
 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per 
share of common stock, payable on February 13, 2020 to shareholders of 
record as of F
ebruary 10, 2020.
 
With that, let's open the call to questions.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, 
may have the first question, please?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Yes. That will be from Amit 
Daryanani with Evercore.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first one for me on Wearables, 

Could you just touch on the growth that you are seeing on the We
arables 
side? How much the growth you think is coming from first time buyers of 
AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the 
products that they have, because it looks to us the adoption rate is fairly low 
in your installed base, s
o there should be a long run way, but love to just 
understand how you see the growth divided between those two buckets.
 
Tim Cook
 

within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, 
Wearables grew 44%. 
So, it was very strong, as you say. Both Apple Watch and AirPods did very 
well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch in particular, 75% of 

selling to n
ew customers at this point.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Perfect. And I guess, Luca, you could just touch on gross margins. The 
March quarter guide I think implies gross margin of flat to actually up 10, 15 
basis point. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross mar
gins up in 
March I think because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage 
happening. So, what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better 
than seasonal guide for gross margins?
 
Luca Maestri
 

entially, and by the way 
significantly higher on a year
-
over
-
year basis. But on a sequential basis, you 
are right, on one side we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality 
but we expect that that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and 
cost 
savings.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Tom Forte with D.A Davidson.
 
Tom Forte
 
So, congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally, how 
you're getting success, is it tru
ly on critical acclaim, is it on number of 
consumers that are using the service, contribution and service revenue, et 
cetera, et cetera? Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 

subscribers. As you can t
ell from the way that we launched the product, we 
started with a very aggressive price at $4.99. And in addition to that we 

year for free. And so, we're very focused on subscribers. 
That said, the 
product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we 
will find that there will be some number of those that will also be critical 
acclaimed. And we're seeing that with the morning show, we're seeing that 
with Little
 
America and others.
 
Tom Forte
 
Great. And then, my second question is I think you indicated that last month 
we started offering consumers the ability to use their Apple Card to buy an 

act 
on your unit sales for iPhones?
 
Tim Cook
 
So, retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double
-
digit growth in 
iPhone from a year
-
over
-
year point of view. And one of the factors that 
enabled that was the 
--
 
getting to a monthly payments on the 
Apple Card to 

very key market for us. And so, it was an important part of it.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Tom. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Sha
nnon Cross, Cross Research.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to revisit China. Tim, can you 
talk about what you are seeing in the region 
--
 
what you were seeing in the 
region prior to the health crisis? And then, can you also 
update us a bit in 
terms of your manufacturing strategy, dual
-
sourcing, geographic 
diversification, even with the region, just so we have some idea of how this 
will be managed? Thank you.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes. Thanks,, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from 
last quarter, and 
then I will get into the coronavirus in a second. For the results from last 
quarter, we had double
-
digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China. So, that 
was an important change from where we've been running. We also had 
double
-
digit growth 
in services in Mainland China and we had extremely 
strong double
-
digit on Wearables. And so, really, there were a number of 
different factors in terms of the things that customers are responding to. 
iPhone 11 is doing well there, the product has been very 
well
-
received with 
its battery life and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably 
know, have certain trading programs going and financing programs. These 
have also been well received.
 

ing quite a large 
percentage of new customers on products like the Mac. Three quarters of the 
customers buying a Mac in China are new, and nearly two
-
thirds of the 
customers buying iPad are new. So, it was a terrific quarter. We had three of 
the top four s
elling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar.
 
In terms of the coronavirus, as I mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our 
thoughts are with all of those that are affected across the region. And as I've 

 
working to contain the 
outbreak. We are also working very closely with our team and our partners 
in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business critical 
situations as of last week. The situation is emerging and we're still gathering 
lots of
 
data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we 
have a wider than usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the 
greater uncertainty.
 
I'll talk about supply chain and customer demand some to give you some 
color. With respect t
o the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the 

obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production 
loss. We've factored best thinking and the guidance th
at we've provided you.
 
With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact 
is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New 
Year has been moved from the end of this month to February 10th, 
depending upon
 
the supplier location, and we've attempted to account for 
this delayed start up through our larger range of outcomes that Luca 
mentioned earlier.
 
With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed one of 
our retail stores and a number of ch
annel partners have also closed their 
store fronts. Many of the stores that remain opened have also reduced 
operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep
-
cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees.
 
While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also 
been impacted outside of this area, across the country in the last few days. 
And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that 

hope that gets you some color.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Yes. That was very helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on from a 
gross margin from perspective, the commodity pricing environment and 
availability. Obviously, there has been some movement on DRAM and NA
ND. 
So, if you can talk about how you are thinking about inventory levels and 
managing that going forward? Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. As I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for 
the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodi
ty environment. Most 
commodities have been declining during the December quarter, and we 
expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always, and as you 
probably know, we look at the way these prices move and at times when we 

 
buy certain commodities in advance. And so, we will 
continue that practice as we go through the year.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Luca, c
an you address the modest slowdown in services growth this quarter, 
17% versus 18% in September? Which services categories accelerated 
versus where did you see some deceleration in the growth?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. The 1
7% during the 

which was 16%. So, we feel very good about the results for the December 
quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was very 
broad
-
based growth becau
se we grew double digits in services across all the 
five geographies. We set all
-
time records for many, many categories, music, 
cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store 
and the AppleCare. If you remember, we had set two goals
 
for ourselves in 


already achieved that goal with the results of the December quarter.
 
We also set a goal to pass
 
500 million paid subscriptions during 2020. And 
given that we are already at 480 at the end of December, we expect to pass 
that mark during the March quarter. So, now, we are setting a new target 
for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so, we are now ai
ming to reach 600 
million before the end of calendar 2020. So, we feel that the services 
business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new 
services very recently. For example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. 
And so, while these serv
ices did not have a material impact in our December 
quarter results, we expect that over time they start contributing to the 
growth of the services business. But, we feel very happy with the 17%.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Thank you for that. Tim, as a follow
-
up, at som
e point in the future, Apple 
will launch a 5G iPhone. How big of a demand driver do you view 5G 
capability in a handset? And what's your view as to what the killer app will 
be from a consumer perspective?
 
Tim Cook
 

. And so, I will try to sidestep a 

--
 
we're in the early innings of its 


r 
position for anybody.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thanks, Katie. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 

 
Kyle McNealy
 
So, we were seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G 
deployments and even 

positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity? Do you get 
the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivize to upgrade 
handsets to get a leverage out of these new network investm
ents? How 
much might this be helping, and do you think it will continue to accelerate?
 
Tim Cook
 

around the world that are really helpful this quarter, as partners. And so, I 
think th
at probably a part of that is the level of investments they have. And 
then, a part of it is probably making sure that those customer stick with 
them in a environment where there's a lot of trading back and forth. So, I 
am optimistic that it will continue.
 
Kyle McNealy
 
Okay, great. And then, the comment that you made about capacity in the 
Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what should we 
think about the timeline of when those capacity constraints might be 
alleviated? And will they come fr
om capacity additions or the natural 
workout of unit shipments and something on the demand side?
 
Tim Cook
 
I'm hopeful that the Series 3 will come in to balance during this quarter. On 
AirPods Pro, I don't have estimate for that for you. I just can't predic
t when 
at this point. We seem to be fairly substantially off their and we're working 
very hard to put in additional capacity.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thanks, Kyle. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Yes. Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America.
 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Hi. Thank 
you. Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can 
you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market, 
as you build out TV+, given you could have the unique position and ability to 
drive targeted ads to users without com
promising on privacy?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think, it is possible to have advertising in a straightforward manner that 

in that business. I think for the TV+ business, we feel 
strongly that what the 
customer wants is an add
-
free product, and so that's not our aversion to 

 
Wamsi Mohan
 
Okay. Thank you. And Luca, can you just clarify if the services revenue this 
quarter had any impact
 
of deferrals associated with TV+ at all? And how can 
you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content costs 
associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years? Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. So, yes. Of course, we launched th
e service and so there was a very 
small contribution to revenue from the deferral, and there was also 
contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually 
paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ 
reven
ue, at this point, there are two components. There is paid subscribers, 
these are the customers that pay for the service and we recognize revenue 
over the subscription period. And then, we got the what we call the Apple 
TV+ bundle subscribers. These are th
e customers that buy an eligible 
hardware device and redeem the offer for a three
-
year of TV+ services. We 
deferred revenue for this offer, based on three items, the first one is the 
value of the service that is being provided, the one year of Apple TV+. T
he 
second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer. And 
the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that will 
redeem the offer. So, you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible 
device sales, you need to 
make a number of reductions for family sharing, 
for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability.
 
Also, the take rate can also be impacted by the availability of local content, 
and we also require a payment method on file. So, this estimate is
 
reviewed 
quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. So, these 
inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we deferred for each 
device sale that then gets recognized over the one
-
year period that the TV 
plus service has provided.
 
So, when you take the combination of paid 
subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue. Of 

revenue that we recognized during the quarter, was immaterial to our 
re
sults.
 
With regard to the cost of developing the content, we 
--
 
essentially as we 
incur these costs, we put them on the balance sheet and then we amortize 
over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we 
produce.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thanks, Wa
msi. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 

 
Krish Sankar
 
I had two questions. First one, Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little 
bit on the overall smartphone market. There is a 
general view that when 5G 

component costs, but at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven 
that there is a market for low cost geographies to phones like iPhone SE. So, 
how do you se
e these two different segments within the smart phone market 
evolving over the next one to three years? And then, I had a follow
-
up for 
Luca.
 
Tim Cook
 


nt when you think about 5G is to look around 
the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look 


n the 

 
Krish Sankar
 
And then, a follow
-
up for Luca. OpEx as a percentage of sales for March 
looks like e about 15% higher than in your prior quarters. Kind of curious 
how much of that is 
--
 
part of it is driven by so
me of your Intel modem asset 
purchases or TV+ in the OpEx or how do we think about it on a go forward 
basis?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. I think we felt good about our OpEx results, because they were at the 
low end of our guidance range. But clearly, we want to make
 
all the 
necessary investments in the business. And in terms of the new services, not 
only for TV+ but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is 

marketing, and that lev
el of investment is reflected in our OpEx results. And 
also, as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel 
baseband business unit in December quarter. And so, we had 
--
 
we reflected 
the run rate of the expenses related to that business
, partially during the 
quarter, after the completion of the transaction. And that is a very important 
core technology for the Company. So, we will continue to make all the 
necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that 
affecte

strong, and we have certain valuable expenses. For example, credit card 
fees that are associated with the higher volume and of course impacted our 
OpEx results.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thanks, Krish. Can
 
we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will be from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler.
 
Mike Olson
 
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, slightly different take 
on an earlier question on Wearables, and that is, what impact you think 
We
arables is driving people into the Apple ecosystem? You mentioned 75% 
watch buyers are new to the Apple Watch, but are many of them new to 
Apple overall? I'm sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPads or Mac users are going 
to Wearables customers, but do you thi
nk Wearables bring people into the 
ecosystem to buy other devices in a material way?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think that 
--
 

I think, they get tighter into the ecosystem because they like 
--
 
that's the 
reason 
that they're buying into it, is they like the experience, the customer 
experience. And so from that point of view, I think each of our products can 

iPhone comes first, but there's
 
no doubt in my mind that there's some 
people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch.
 
Mike Olson
 
Okay. And then, I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will 
pervade our entire lives. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts 
abo
ut how you think it starts to impact our lives most significantly. For 
example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage 
or some other category? In other words, where will the average person kind 
of first feel that impact of AR 
on their lives in a significant way? Thanks.
 
Tim Cook
 
I think, when you look at AR today, you would see that there are consumer 
applications, there are enterprise applications. This is the reason I'm so 
excited about it is, you rarely have a new technology
 
where business and 
consumer are both see it as key to them. And so, I think, the answer is 
---
 

to go across business and your home life. I think, these things will happen in
 
parallel. There are already companies that are deep into enterprise business 
that are working on applications for the enterprise. And of course you can 
see 
--
 
you go on to store, see thousands of apps that are AR kit enabled at 
this time and would even mo
re coming.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Raymond James, Chris Caso.
 
Chris Caso
 
Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess, the first question is on gross 
margins. And you spoke about the favora
ble mix. Wondering if you could 
expand on that a little bit. And clearly, iPhone is doing well within the overall 
mix that growing year
-
on
-
year. But, if you could talk about what's 
happening to the mix within iPhone, is that improving as well and also 
help
ing margins? And is there anything else you would point to with regard 
to the overall mix in margins?
 
Luca Maestri
 

the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhone
s. The 
customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max is being 
exceptional. And that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top 
selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And 
so certainly, better mix within iPhon
e. The other point that I would like to 
point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue 
coming from services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given that 
fact that services are accretive to gross margin for the Company, we end
 
up 
getting a better mix from services as well.
 
Chris Caso
 
Okay. Thank you. And I guess, follow
-
on question with regard to OpEx. And 
it has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for I guess largely over the 
last three years or so. Can you set us some expectation with regard to when 
you get a return on that in
vestment? I understand there are new 
investments that are happening now. But, how should we think about 
potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the OpEx 
spending tend to level off and you get some return on that or is it just the 
f
unction of a faster revenue growth in future?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Well, I would start by saying that our expense to revenue ratio is incredibly 
competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when 
our OpEx grows faster than our revenue but 
we also had years in the recent 
past where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have 
a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look this past year, 
we launched many new initiatives, for example, on the services front
, which 
we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, and not only 
marketing and advertising but also in R&D.
 
As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband 

ore technology for 

during this quarter and the guidance that we provided for the March quarter, 


making on the expense front, with the level of returns that we get 

net income for example was up 11% during the December quarter.
 
Tejas Gala
 
Thank you. Can we have the next ques
tion, please?
 
Operator
 
That will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
I just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth, definitely good to 

for the produc
ts exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about 
sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through year? And I have a follow
-
up.
 
Tim Cook
 

you the range that we expect for th
e current quarter and really don't give a 
range beyond that.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Okay. So, if I can just maybe then follow up in terms of 
--
 

returned to growth in most of the regions you report. One of the regions that 
are declining is Japan
. So, if you can share your thoughts on what actions 
you need to take there to return that segment and that geography to grow? 
And what are the product trends there and what's probably the headwind 
that's kind of limiting growth there?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes. So
, Japan was down 10% during the December quarter. It was 
primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenged because there 
were some regulatory changes that took effect on the 1st of October where 
essentially the regulators decoupled the mobile phone
 
pricing from the two
-
year contract and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts 
that can be made. At the same time, I would say, within a more difficult 
macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter, six of the 
top seven sell
ing smart models in Japan during the December quarter were 
iPhones. So, it was very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult 
environment. Also, in Japan, we had very strong double
-
digit growth from 
services, stronger than Company average; and very stron
g double
-
digit 
growth in Wearables, also stronger than Company average. So, we feel very 

customers are very loyal and very engaged and we have very strong position 
there, we feel we h
ave a very good momentum.

Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple, Incorporated Fourth Quarter

Please go ahead, ma'am.
 
Nancy Paxton

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking

Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.
 
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion 
today will consist of forward
-
looking statements, including without limitation 
those regarding revenue, gro
ss margin, operating expenses, other income 
and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends 
could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer 
to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10
-
K for 2015,
 
the forms 10
-
Q 
for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8
-
K filed with the 
SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no 
obligation to update any forward
-
looking statements or information which

Apple, Inc.
 
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the 
middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this we
ek, we're 
holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited and 
we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.
 
Our results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated 
$46.9 billion in revenue in the quar
ter, toward the high end of our guidance 
range. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range. We sold 45.5 
million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year
-
over
-
year 
performance compared to the last two quarters, as we forecasted in January.
 
iPhone sales were up year
-
over
-
year in 33 of our top 40 markets.
 
As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal customers 
in the world, and fiscal 2016 saw more customers switch from Android to 
iPhone than ever before. This is due to the s
uperior customer experience we 
deliver with our products, and it's something no other company can match.
 
We had a record
-
setting quarter for Services, with revenue growth 
accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion. App Store revenue continued to 
skyrocket,
 
while Music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing 
popularity of Apple Music. In fact, J.D. Power recently announced that Apple 
Music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music 
market.
 
Earlier this month I visited Japan, whe
re Apple Pay went live yesterday. 
Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments 
where they commute, dine and shop, so we expect a strong response and 
rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong 
growt
h in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in 
Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next few 
months.
 
Apple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year
-
on
-
year for the 
September quarter. In fact, we completed more
 
transactions in the month of 
September than we did across all of fiscal 2015. And with Apple Pay support 
now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple 
Pay to their customers. Our major partners tell us that Apple Pay shows th
e 
highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.
 
We remain very confident about the future of our Services business given 
the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing 
installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our Serv
ices revenue in 
the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a 
Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017.
 
As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to 
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These are the best iPho
nes we've ever made, 
with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the 
best iPhone performance in battery life ever, thanks to the custom
-
designed 
Apple A10 Fusion chip. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone 
displays to date a
nd come in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to 
outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' 
hands as quickly as possible.
 
We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next 
generation of the world's most 
popular smartwatch, packed with new 
features including built
-
in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter 
display and a powerful dual
-
core processor. Individuals and businesses alike 
are recognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay hea
lthy, 
motivated and connected. One recent example is Aetna, which has 
announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience 
by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large 
employers. In addition, Aetna is also prov
iding Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 
of its own employees to encourage them to live a healthier day.
 
We've just rolled out new versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS and 
customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac, 
enhanced health 
and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch and a delightful 
new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call memories. 
We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive 
and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible i
nk and handwritten 
notes. We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all new App Store 
for Messages, and there has been a marked increase in our monthly active 
users.
 
One of the great new features of iOS 10 is the Home app, which is making 
home au
tomation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can easily 
set up and securely control all their HomeKit accessories, from lights and 
cameras to the garage doors and air conditioners, all from their favorite iOS 
devices. We expect over 100 HomeKit
-
compatible products to be on the 
market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple to help 
ensure customer security when using them. Our Apple stores are wonderful 
places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected 
h
ome.
 
With our latest operating systems, machine learning is making our products 
and services smarter, more intuitive and even more personal. We've been 
using these technologies for years to create better user experiences, and 
we've also been investing heav
ily both through R&D and acquisitions. Today, 
machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our 
products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10, which offers 
suggestions on which app you might want to use or which context you migh
t 
want to include in an email. Our camera and photo software uses advanced 
face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene 
recognition to make them easier to sort and find. Machine learning makes 
the fitness features of Apple Watch m
ore accurate and even helps extend 
battery life across our products.
 
Machine learning continually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as 
understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new 
ways by opening it to developers and most
 
recently by making Siri available 
to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra. We're already seeing great momentum in just 
the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs and 
we're very happy with the engagement it's driving with Siri.
 
Looking a
head, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. 
Reliance Jio is rolling out a a first of its kind all
-
IP network in India with 4G 
coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country. They're 
offering a free year of service to pur
chasers of new iPhones and we're 
partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their network. 
Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the 
prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of t
his 
large and growing market opportunity.
 
We're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, 
which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership with 
Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the w
ay they work 
by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS platform. 
Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic 
advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions across 
the enterprise. We're also
 
collaborating on the development of Enterprise 
Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more 
than 20 industries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly 
develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping.
 
As we c
lose the books on another incredible year, I'd like to thank our 
talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best 
products in the world, our amazing developer community for their relentless 
creativity and our wonderful customers, busi
ness partners and shareholders 
for their loyalty and support.
 
Now I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September 
quarter.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September 
quarter was $46.9 bil
lion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our 
revenue grew very strongly in many emerging markets, including Russia, 
Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand and Vietnam, and we continue to see solid 
growth in Japan and in Latin America.
 
Gross margin was 
38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to 
favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue and 
net income was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 and cash 
flow from operations was $16.1 billion, which is a new record f
or the 
September quarter. For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 
45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of 
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and continued strong demand for other iPhones. 
Including 2.7 million
 
iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, 
we increased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited 
the quarter well below our five to seven week target range of channel 
inventory.
 
We experienced strong iPhone growth in many 
markets around the world, 
including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern 
Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. iPhone sales in Greater China 
declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to iPhone 7 
and 7 Plu
s gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in 
China will be significantly better on a year
-
over
-
year basis than our 
September quarter results, even as we lap the all
-
time record period from a 
year ago.
 
Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 
Plus has significantly outpaced supply, 
particularly on iPhone 7 Plus, and we're working very hard to get the new 
iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.
 
iPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter, which was above 
our exp
ectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we launched 
iPhone SE and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect 
iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to 
our ASP in the December quarter last y
ear.
 
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In 
the U.S. for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found that 
among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% 
plan to purchase iPhone, with
 
the current iPhone owners reporting a 97% 
customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest 
survey measured a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating and found that 
of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarte
r, 79% 
planned to purchase iPhone.
 
Turning to Services, we generated an all
-
time record $6.3 billion in revenue 
with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App Store growth rate has 
now accelerated for five consecutive quarters, reaching 43% in the 
Septem
ber quarter. The App Store remains the preferred destination for 
both customers and developers. According to App Annie, it generated 100% 
more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition 
to the great performance from apps, we saw 
strong double
-
digit revenue 
growth in several other service categories and Apple Pay transaction volume 
has grown dramatically, as Tim mentioned.
 
Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a 
difficult year
-
over
-
year compare, give
n the launch of new Macs in the spring 
of 2015. Despite this, our Mac installed base reached a new all
-
time high at 
the end of the September quarter and we'll have some exciting news to 
share with current and future Mac owners very soon. We ended the quart
er 
below our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory.
 
Turning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, 
$26 higher than a year ago, with increase driven by the new iPad Pro line. 
We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we 
reduced channel inventory by about 
80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five to seven
-
week target range.
 
We continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and 
customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. 
Re
cent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the U.S. tablet 
market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above 
$200. And in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction 
rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Ai
r, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro. 
Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six 
months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase 
intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro once again 
the 
top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 94% 
satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December 
quarter.
 
In the enterprise market, we are seeing some great examples of iPad and 
Mac deployment. Our Mobility Partner
 
Program continues to grow stronger, 
with over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to 
businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point
-
of
-
sale solution 
partner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to 
im
plement Revel's iPad based POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations 
worldwide, including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is 
available.
 
IBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With 
more employees choos
ing Mac than ever before, there are now more than 
90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 
iPhones. IBM reports that PCs have three times the cost to manage, drive 
twice the number of support calls and are 5 times more lik
ely to require a 
follow
-
up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs. Thanks to much lower 
support cost and significantly higher residual value, the company is saving 
as much as $535 per computer when comparing the total cost of Mac 
ownership to a PC over 
a full
-
year lifecycle.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 
billion. $216 billion of this cash or 91% of the total was outside the United 
States. We
 
issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in 
term debt at the end of the quarter.
 
We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as 
follows. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 
billion
 
on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open market 
transactions, and we launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial 
delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our 
seventh accelerated share repurchase program, wi
th adding an additional 
12.3 million shares. So total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our 
share count by 1.5%. We have now completed $186 billion of our current 
$250 billion capital return program, including $133 billion in share 
repurchases.
 
D
uring the September quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and 
incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year 
was $12.8 billion. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly 
higher than the 25.5% we guided to 
because of a differential graphic mix of 
earnings relative to our regional expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal 
year was 25.6%
 
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our 
outlook, which includes the types of forward
-
loo
king information that Nancy 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the all
-
time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago. We expect 
gross m
argin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be 
between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 
million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.
 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per 
s
hare of common stock, payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders of 
record as of November 7, 2016.
 
With that, I would like to open the call to questions.

First we'll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.

Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Hey, good afternoon and congratulations. And Tim, now that we're a month
 
in the iPhone 7, are you seeing anything measurable in terms of the growing 
trend of annual upgrades? And second is, historically in terms of new 
product categories, you guys have always looked for unique advantage 
before getting into a segment. And I'm c
urious about the car. There are a lot 
of rumors out there, and would like your perspective on how you think about 
an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
In terms of iPhone 7, Gene, the carriers that had upgra
de plans, the 
information that we have from them is that demand is very robust. But from 
a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in 
the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so it's sort 
of we ar
e in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be 
able to differentiate. But on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade 
programs are a win.
 
I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can 
improve the exper
ience and the customers' experience on different sets of 
products. And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in 
general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will 
either become available or will be able to rev
olutionize the car experience. 
And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly 
nothing to announce today.
 
Eugene Charles Munster

Just one quick follow up in terms of the supply. Do you think we'll be at 
equi
librium by the end of the quarter for iPhone supplies?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7 we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not 
sure. I wouldn't say yes at this point, because the underlying demand looks 
extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus 
versus our forecast going into the product launch.

Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, can you help us understand what's 
embedded in revenue guidance for the extra week as well as any rebuilding 
of channel inventory giv
en all the major products are running below target? 
Just trying to get at whether you see revenue and in particular iPhone 
growth year on year on more of a sellout basis when you adjust for those 
two factors? And then I have a follow up.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
App
le, Inc.
 
Yes Katy, sure. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue up 
for the December quarter. Keep in mind that December quarter a year ago 
for us was an all
-
time quarterly revenue record. We think we can grow this 
year. As Tim said, the inter
est from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is 
very strong. The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 
24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the 
December quarter.
 
You mentioned the 14th week, and the few extra 
days do help us this 
quarter. But I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other 
factors that go and offset these extra few days. As you know, the launch 
timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first 90 days of 
sales this y
ear hit Q4. There were only two days last year, so the cadence 
has moved more towards the Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, 
we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first 
quarter of 2016. As Tim said, we are very suppl
y constrained on iPhone 7 
Plus this year. We're simply more supply constrained this year than we were 
a year ago.
 
And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the 
compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award f
or a 
patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one
-
off item that is 
not going to repeat this year. And also the foreign exchange environment 
remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis int
o the December quarter. So I hope that gives you a 
bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe 
that this is a good guidance for the December quarter.
 
Kathryn Lynn Huberty

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
That's great color. Thank
 
you for that. A follow up for Tim. What should we 
read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years 
while sales growth was sort of a fifth of that? Are R&D investments just less 
efficient than they were in the company's history, 
or should we think about 
that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in 
the development phase that have not reached the mar
ket, and so that's a 
part of it. And we feel really great about the things that we've got. We've 
also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business as well and on making 
the ecosystem even better. And so we're very much, we're confidently 
investing in the
 
future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend 
increasing.

Operator
 
From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.
 
Sh
annon S. Cross 
-
 
Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a 
bit more about China, just how you're thinking about it, where you're seeing 
pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant 
rebound during the first quarter, but what are your customers telling you 
about the demand in China?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's a good question, Shannon. So to sort of back up from our results 
for the quarter, the 90
-
day clock, and look a
t the full year of 2016, we were 
down 17% compared to the fiscal year 2015 which was up 84% from the 
previous year. So if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52% and 
the CAGR was 23%, which is really a pretty good result.
 
Also as you probably know, 
the fiscal year 2016 performance was hurt by 
the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%, so the 
underlying business performance was 14% down. And so, why was it down? 
There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you
 
look 
at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came 
into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate 
increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. 
And so when that upgrade rate
 
in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more 
normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 
5S as a point, it had further to fall. And so that's the main reason in our view 
that you see a difference.
 
Now that spun or created 
another issue for us, because we didn't forecast 
that accurately. So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory 
and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that 
came beyond it or came after it. And so those two issues, 
which really the 
main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are 
in our views the main issue. Now looking forward, the response to the 
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, 
as you know, whe
n you're selling everything you're making. And so we'll find 
out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys 
guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels 
very good for us.
 
And from a longer
-
term poin
t of view, out of the 90
-
day clocks and so forth, 
we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is 
booming there. There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, 
but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so wit
h the number 
of middle class 

 
people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption 
rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue 
to have a really good opportunity there, and so we continue to focus 
significantly in Chin
a.

Shannon S. Cross

And then can you talk a bit about acquisitions? And I don't mean like the 
smaller ones that you've done sort of at a nor
mal cadence, but there was 
clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world. 
And especially if you find a way to have repatriation of some of the cash at a 
low tax rate possibly with the next administration. So I just, if you ca
n give 
sort of an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a 
little bit larger than normal.
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we 
can deliver better products to 
our customers and innovate more. And so we 
look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether 
to move forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely look.

Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. I have a question an
d a follow
-
up, please. I guess a cynic 
could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is 
benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray. And yet from your 
guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up 
more than low single
-
digits implied from your guidance. And I appreciate 
some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the 
launch, but if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new 
products, your major competitor's layi
ng down, you have an enormous, you 
have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably 7% or 8%, and 
yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish, what does that really say about how 
investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing fo
rward? 
And is it reasonable to think that this is an ongoing growing business for the 
company?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Toni, let me take this one. I think you mentioned a number of the things 
that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went thr
ough them with 
Katy just a few minutes ago. You're right, we've got an extra few days. You 
know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased 
iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned two 
issues that affec
t us, the one
-
timer from a year ago that you obviously need 
to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business 
right now.
 
But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply 
constrained on 7 and 7 Plus. And s
o when you talk about other competitors, 
it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling 
everything that we can produce. And so when we look at all these things in 
its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believ
e that 
revenue's going to grow. You know that we don't get into specific product 
from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about 
the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward.

Okay. Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about 
television being an area of intense interest. I was wondering if you could 
reaffirm that statement. Is that still the case? And then additionally, given 
what's happ
ening with acquisitions, how broadly you think about the role of 
content. Apple has started creating on a very limited scale some of its own 
content and whether you think content creation and ownership is important 
to Apple, or whether Apple ultimately see
s its place in the value chain as 
being more around the ecosystem and distribution.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other 
people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, 
we have 
started with focusing on some original content, as you point out. We've got a 
few things going there that we've talked about. And I think it's a great 
opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point 
of view. and so it's
 
is an area that we're focused on.

Operator
 
From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski.
 
Simona K. Jankowski 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thank you. I have a question for Luca and 
then one for Tim as well. Luca, I 
wanted to dig into the Services business a bit more. As you pointed out, it 
accelerated again to 24%. How does that compare to the pace of growth of 
the installed base, just to help us decouple how much of it is consumptio
n 
driven on a per user basis versus the base as a whole?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Simona, the installed base number is something that we talk about 
periodically. The last time we talked about it, it was in the January call. It is 
growing. Our 
installed base is growing very well, which is very important for 
us. It's growing on all major products and it's growing of course in total. 
When you look at our Services revenue, the growth of the Services revenue 
has been accelerating during the course o
f the year during a period when, as 
you know, our revenue came down slightly.
 
So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our 
customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually 
taking advantage of our services over 
time tend spend more and more on 
our services. We've got customers that are very engaged with our products. 
They're very loyal, and so you see this upward trajectory of our Services 
business. It's not only with the App Store but there's several categories 
that 
are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we got other 
parts of the business that continue to do well, even as I said during a period 
of time when our sales have come down a bit.
 
Simona K. Jankowski 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thank you. 
And then Tim, we've seen an increasing focus on artificial 
intelligence, both in smartphones like the new Pixel from Google but also in 
some of the home assistance, like the Amazon Echo. And you guys have 
obviously had Siri for a while as well. But I just 
am curious how you think 
about balancing AI with your focus on privacy. And then also how important 
it is to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the 
home assistant?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I think to answer your second
 
question first, I think that most people would 
like an assistant with them all the time. And we live in a mobile society. 
People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that 
they may be doing. And so the advantage of having a assistant
 
on your 
phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there is not a nice 
market for a home one. I'm not making that point. I'm just saying on a 
balance point of view, I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be 
much greater.
 
In fact
, you can just look at Siri today and this is now accelerating with iOS 
10 and the Mac, but we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. 
And so it's very large and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more 
assistant enabled devices than pr
obably anyone out there. Our focus is on 
this worldwide, and so it's not only a U.S. focus, but we want to deliver a 
great experience around the world and deliver it globally, and so we've put a 
lot of the energy into doing that.
 
In terms of the balance be
tween privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, 
but at a high level, I think it's a false trade
-
off that people would like you to 
believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something 
for you. We don't buy that. It may take a differe
nt kind of work. It might 
take more thinking, but I don't think we should throw our privacy away. It's 
sort of like the age
-
old argument about privacy versus security. We should 
have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so that at a high level is 
how
 
we see it.

Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted ask you about the total deferred 
revenue which was down about $1.3 billion in June and I think down another 
$400 million in September. Those are rather large declines, even given the 
fact that yo
ur units are coming down and you had the accounting change 
back in September. Could you talk about some of the drivers of that and 
what you might expect going forward?
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Steve, you mentioned by far the largest driver. The largest d
river is the fact 
that we made the change, an accounting change to our ESPs exactly a year 
ago. So we are lapping the year where you see the effect. I think you're not 
going to see the same thing going forward. And then we tend to defer some 
revenue on som
e other categories, like for example gift cards or some 
AppleCare, but in general by far the largest element is the change in ESPs. 
And again, I don't think you're going to see the same impact going forward.

Okay. 
Thank you. And then, Tim, some investors are antsy that Apple has 
not acquired new profit pools or introduced a financially material new 
product in recent years. The question is, A, does Apple today have a grand 
strategy for what you want to do? I know you
 
won't tell us what it us, but do 
you know what you want to do over the next three to maybe five years? Or 
is it more a read the market and quickly react? And B, do you have any 
sense that we're kind of in a gap period where the technology and arguably 
wha
t we'd call the next job to be done haven't yet aligned? And so maybe in 
a couple years, we will see this flurry of new products and it'll sort of match 
what people want to do, but it's not quite here yet?

We have the

confident about the things in it. But as usual, we're not going to talk about 
what's ahead.
 
Steven M. Milunovich

UBS Securities LLC
 
But in terms of your approach I guess to new products, do you have
 
a 
strong sense of where technology is going and where you're going to play? 
Or is it still enough up the year that you are willing to react fairly quickly, 
which arguably your organization allows you to do for the size of company 
you are?

From Bank of America, Wamsi Mohan.

Yes. Thank you. So, Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise the ASP on 
the iPhone 7 Plus by $20 and you're completely sold out. So clearly this 
device plays a central role in
 
our lives, so much that owners probably look at 
that incremental cost as a great trade
-
off to get the best device out there. 
So as you see more and more features being added into iPhones, do you 
conceptually expect that you are anywhere close to the point
 
where raising 
ASPs further would be net disruptive to demand? Or do you see more rooms 
to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features? And I have a follow 
up.
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
With the iPhone 7 Plus, we put an incredible amount o
f innovation into the 
camera and the overall photo experience, and customers are obviously using 
that and have discovered that they love it. And so we're getting an incredible 
amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. 
And, 
but the mix that we projected on iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the 
reality is and so we are chasing supply there. In terms of the ASP, the way 
we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we don't want to 
charge more than that, and we think 
it's worth being fair. And so that's how 
we look at it.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world, 
the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases 
because of the FX
 
situation, right. And that's something that we need to 
keep in mind as well.
 
Wamsi Mohan

Great. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. And Tim, this year we saw carrier 
incentives come back to force post the launch of the iP
hone 7, 7 Plus. Two 
years ago there was a giant upgrade to iPhone from the iPhone 6, 6 Plus. Do 
you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come 
back into play given worries around customer churn, thereby making the 
phone even m
ore affordable? Thanks.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
We clearly saw that this year. There's a lot of competition for customers in 
the U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking about. Whether 
that'll happen every two years, I don't know. But
 
I suspect that any time 
there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two 
year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably 
will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.

Thank you very much. A strategy question for Tim and then more of a 
financial question for Luca. Tim, you'd mentioned in your prepared 
comments a little bit about India and we've been doing a lot of work talking 
about the opportunity in India. And
 
we get a lot of pushback talking about 
disposable income metrics and lots of things like that, yet the population 
being so large, can you talk a little bit about, do you see that India could at 
some point be as big of an opportunity as China? And it appea
rs that the 
legal rules have kind of prevented you from going in a lot, but it looks like 
that's changing. Can you just kind of give us a little more clarity on India?
 
And then, Tim, for the clarification questions, is it fair to say that the OpEx 
has a di
sproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should 
kind of think of maybe as we go forward, that we shouldn't expect the OpEx 
to kind of be chugging along at that high rate? Or is it just kind of the rate of 
investing that you're going? Tha
nk you very much, gentlemen.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll let Luca talk about the OpEx piece of it. On 
India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may 
be what you're looking at, but so
rt of look at the number of people that are 
or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. And the age 
of the population, if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 
25. And so you have a very, very young population.
 
The s
martphone has not done as well in India in general. However, one of 
the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. But this year 
or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G 
and we couldn't be more excited ab
out that because it really takes a great 
network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people. 
And so I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there. I also 
think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure 
and on 
creating jobs, which is fantastic, because you really need the kind of 
infrastructure and the technology to do that.
 
Will it be as big as China? I think it's clear that the population of India will 
exceed China sometime in probably the next decade o
r so, maybe less than 
that. I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it, but that's not critical 
for us to have a great success there. The truth is, there's going to be a lot of 
people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really 
want a 
smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. 
And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there is 
a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to 
realize that opportunity.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
And, Jim, on OpEx, our approach to OpEx is quite clear and quite simple. We 
want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think is 
critical for us to invest. So you see that we make significant investments 
in 
R&D. You've seen the growth rates over the last couple of years. We are 
making important investments in data centers because we want to support 
our services business. We continue to open retail stores around the world. 
We continue to invest in marketing
 
and advertising. At the same time, we 
want to continue to be efficient and lean. It's something that we've done 
very well over the years and want to continue to do that.
 
So what you've seen, for example in fiscal 2016, you've seen investments in 
R&D growi
ng at 25% and then our SG&A expenses to be about flat. And this 
is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going 
forward. If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance 
for the December quarter, we got an expense 
to revenue ratio of 9%. This is 
extremely competitive in our industry and I would say in general. And so we 
want to continue to have this balance, make the right investments and 
remain efficient.

We'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
 
Rod B. Hall 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks fo
r the question. I had one for Luca and then a 
follow
-
up for Tim. So, Luca, I wanted to ask about the gross margin 
guidance. I think that the Street and we were expecting something a little 
bit higher. And again, that's about 50 basis points lower and the S
treet it 
was I think 70 basis points lower. And I'm just curious, do you think that 
people are mis
-
modeling that or is there something going on with pricing or 
mix there that you could provide us more color on? So that's my first 
question.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
A
pple, Inc.
 
Yeah, Rod, let me give you some detail both on a sequential basis and I'll 
give you also something on a year
-
over
-
year basis because maybe that's 
where the disconnect comes from, looking at the last year's gross margins in 
the December quarter. 
On a sequential basis, we are essentially guiding to 
some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter 
and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the 
December quarter because on the positive, we're going to have of
 
course 
better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But 
we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be 
partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are 
launching now and we've l
aunched already a few during the September 
quarter and that will have an impact on our December quarter results.
 
On a year
-
over
-
year basis, keep in mind that last year we did, in Q1, we did 
40%, around 40%, 40%, 41%, but there's a couple of things that I t
hink 
need to be considered before doing a year
-
over
-
year compare. And it's the 
fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 
million. That is, at the gross margin level, is 40 bps. And then we've got the 
FX situation, which I ment
ioned before, which is worth another 60 bps, 70 
bps. And so you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis where again, we have the reality of new cost structures 
into our products.
 
It is very, very important I think fo
r investors to understand that what's 
happened during the last two years. During the last two years, the U.S. 
dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do 
business. And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues 
ou
tside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So on a year
-
over
-
year basis, just 2016 over 2015 was 340 bps impact from foreign 
exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a 
number of initiatives going from prici
ng actions to cost initiatives to our 
hedging program, but at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new 
normal and we need to work with that. And I think over the years, we made 
very good trade
-
offs and our gross margins have been quite stable over 
tim
e.
 
Rod B. Hall

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted you to ask you, this 
question comes up once in a while, but I just wanted to ask you if you could 
talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the d
ividend 
question. I mean, Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very 
large company. It's getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is 
significantly below the S&P 500. I know you can't tell us what your 
intentions are here, but if you
 
could help us understand how that thinking 
around the dividend works, it would be great.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
We review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now 
to announce our thinking on that every April. And so we h
ave a robust 
discussion around the dividend and the buyback. We very much believe that 
Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the 
company that we know really well. And so that thinking has I think proven 
out over time and I th
ink been very good for our shareholders. And in 
addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and 
some ongoing income, and so we've provided a amount that we think is a 
good amount and have a good track record of raising it annual
ly. And so 
we'll be able to say more on that I'm sure in April of next year.

Good day. And welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 

 
At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the 
call over to Nancy 
Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead.
 
Nancy Paxton

Q and the Form 8
-
K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple 
assumes no obligation to update any forward
-
looking statements or 
information, which speak as of their respective dates.
 
And I'd like to 

-
weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14
-
weeks.
 

 
Tim Cook
 
Thanks, Nancy and thanks everyone on the call, a
nd welcome to everyone 
today. Before we dive into the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to talk 
about a significant milestone we recently crossed.
 
Apple's active installed base reached 1.3 billion devices in January and is at 
an all
-
time high for all of o
ur major products. 1.3 billion devices represents 
an astonishing 30% growth in just two years. It speaks to the strength and 
reliability of our products and our ecosystem, as well as the loyalty, 
satisfaction and engagement of our customers. It's also fuel
ing tremendous 

 
Turning to the December quarter. We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest 
quarter ever, which set new all
-
time records in both revenue and earnings. 
We genera
ted revenue of $88.3 billion, which is above the high
-
end of our 
guidance range, and it is up almost $10 billion or 13% over the previous all
-
time record we set a year ago.
 
It's also our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth with 
double 
digit growth in each of our geographic segments around the world. 
What makes us even more remarkable is that the quarter we're reporting 
today was 13
-
weeks long, while the year ago quarter was 14
-
weeks. When 
we look at the average revenue per week in the D
ecember quarter this year 
compared to last year, our growth was a stunning 21%.
 
Our growth was broad
-
based and a key driver was iPhone, which generated 
its highest revenue ever. iPhone X was the best
-
selling smartphone in the 
world in the December quarter 
according to Canalys, and it has been our top 
selling phone every week since it launched. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus 
rounded out the top three iPhones in the quarter. In fact, revenue for our 
newly launched iPhones was the highest of any lineup in our hist
ory, driving 
total Apple revenue above our guidance range.
 
I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous amount of work that 
went into creating iPhone X. Our teams carried out an extremely complex 
launch from both an engineering and operations perspe
ctive, executing an 
outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development; 
one that introduced innovative features like an edge
-
to
-
edge Super Retina 
Display and the TrueDepth Camera, which enables Face ID. Our customers 
love these new fe
atures and the new gestures like simply swiping up from 
the bottom, which make using iPhone even more intuitive and enjoyable.
 

today, set a standard for the next decade of smartphones and 
we are very 
proud of their achievements.
 
It was another very strong quarter for services with revenue of $8.5 billion, 

our 2016 services revenue by 2020. The number of paid subscripti
ons across 
our services offerings passed 240 million by the end of the December 

the largest quarterly growth ever.
 
We had an all
-
time record quarter for the App Store with our be
st holiday 

customers now enjoying over 2,000 ARKit enabled app, spanning every 
category in the App Store. In December, when Pokémon GO released its new 
augmented reality features buil
t with ARKit, it jumped the top of the App 
Store charts. Last week, on a stop in Toronto, I met developers who are 
hard at work on creative applications using ARKit from art appreciation to 
ecommerce, and I was very impressed with what I saw.
 
Just four mon

ARKit 1.5 in beta to developers around the world, and the response has been 
tremendous. Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the 
experiences we have with mobile devices. And with
 

developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the 
most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. 
This is something only Apple can do.
 
In addition to the App Store, several other services had
 
a biggest quarter 
ever, including Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay, all of which saw growth in 
both active users and revenue.
 
Apple Pay has reached an important milestone in the U.S. As a result of 50% 
year
-
over
-

 
accepted at more than 
half of all American retail locations, which includes more than two
-
thirds of 

Pay purchase volume more than tripled year
-
over
-

to be e
xpanding to Brazil in the coming months.
 
Today, you can use Apple Pay to take a subway in Guangzhou, China, see a 

National Park. In the U.S., we launched Apple Pay Cash in December, and 

 
off to a terrific start. Millions of people are already using it to send and 
receive money with friends and family quickly, easily and securely; to split a 
bill, pay someone back, or send last minute gift right from the messages 
app.
 
It was our best quart
er ever for the Apple Watch with over 50% growth in 
revenue and units for the fourth quarter in a row and strong double
-
digit 
growth in every geographic segment. Sales of Apple Watch Series 3 models 
were also more than twice the volume of Series 2 a year a
go. Apple Watch is 
the most popular, smart watch in the world and gained market share during 
the quarter based on the latest estimates from IDC.
 
It was the third consecutive quarter of growth for iPad revenue, thanks to 
the strength of both iPad and iPad P
ro. Based on the latest data from IDC, 
we gained share in nearly every market we track with strong 
outperformance in emerging markets.
 
Worldwide, almost half of our iPad sales were the first
-
time tablet buyers or 

n some of our most developed 
markets, including Japan and France. In China, new and switching users 
made up over 70% of all iPad sales.
 
For Mac, we launched the all new, iMac Pro in mid
-

new product line designed for our Pro users
 
who love the all
-
in
-
one design of 
iMac and require workstation class performance. It's the fastest, most 
powerful Mac ever, delivering incredible computational power, for simulation 
and real time 3D rendering, immersive VR and complex photography audio 
an
d video projects. Worldwide, 60% of our Mac sales were to first time 
buyers and switchers and in China, that number was almost 90%.
 

next week. HomePod is an innovative wireless speaker,
 
which delivers 
stunning audio quality wherever its placed in the home, thanks to the 
advanced Apple engineered hardware and software.
 
Together with Apple Music, HomePod gives you instant access to one of the 
world's largest music catalogs. And with the 

powerful assistant you control through natural voice interaction. We're very 
happy with the initial response from reviewers who've experienced HomePod 
ahead of its launch, and we think our customers are going to love this new 
p
roduct.
 
We believe one of the key issues of the 21st century is education. And 
because of that, we've strengthened our commitment and investment into 
initiatives like everyone can code. To find the innovators of the future, we 
need to nurture the students 
of today. Our App Development with Swift 
curriculum, which is available free on iBooks, has been downloaded more 
than 1.2 million times worldwide with almost half of those coming from here 

 
colleges 

seekers.
 
I was in London two weeks ago as we announced that the program was 
expanding to more than 70 colleges and universities in Europe. Millions of 
students around the w
orld will have the opportunity to add Swift to their 

This is an exciting time at Apple and with the best lineup of products and 
services we've ever had and a set of initiatives that 
show how business can 
be a force for good in the world. We could not be more excited about our 
future.
 
Now, for more details on the December quarter results, I'd like to turn over 
the call to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our
 
business and financial 
performance in the December quarter were exceptional, as we set new all
-
time records for revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per 
share.
 

-
time record, $88.3 billion, up 
near
ly $10 billion or 13% over the prior record set last year. It is our fifth 
consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. As you know, the 
December quarter a year ago spanned 14
-
weeks compared to 13
-
weeks this 
year, which is important to consider as w
e assess the underlying 
performance of our business this year. When we look at average revenue 
per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21% with growth across all 
product categories for the third consecutive quarter.
 
Our results were terrific all aroun
d the world with double digit revenue 
growth in all our geographic segments, an all
-
time quarterly record in the 
vast majority of markets we track, including the U.S., Western Europe, 
Japan, Canada Australia and Korea, as well as Mainland China, Latin 
Amer
ica, The Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, and India.
 
In Greater China, we were very happy to generate double digit revenue 
growth for the second quarter in a row and in emerging markets outside of 
Greater China, we saw 25% year
-
over
-
year growth.
 
Gr
oss margin was 38.4% at the high end of our guidance range. Operating 
margin was 29.8% of revenue. Our net income was $20.1 billion an all
-
time 
record, and up $2.2 billion over the last year. Diluted earnings per share 
were $3.89 also an all
-
time record an
d cash flow from operations was very 
strong of $28.3 billion.
 
During the quarter, we sold 77.3 million iPhones, the highest number ever 
for a 13
-
week quarter. Average weekly iPhone sales were up 6% compared 
to December quarter last year with growth in ever
y region of the world 
despite the staggered launch of iPhone X. We established all
-
time iPhone 
revenue record in nearly every market we track with double
-
digit growth in 
all of our geographic segments. iPhone ASP increased to $796 from $695 a 
year ago, dri
ven primarily by the launch of iPhone X and the success of 
iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.
 
We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range 
of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory with less than 1 million 
more iPhones in the channel
 
compared to the December quarter a year ago, 
in line with our growth in average weekly unit sales. Customer interest and 
satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and 
business users.
 
The latest data from 451 Research indicates U.S.
 
customer satisfaction 
ratings of 96% or higher across iPhone models. In fact, combining iPhone 8, 
iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, consumers reported an amazing 99% 
satisfaction rating. And among business customers planning to purchase 
smartphones in the next 
quarter, 77% planned to purchase iPhone. Our 
customers are also incredibly loyal with Comcast latest U.S. research, 
reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured.
 
Turning to services. We had a terrific quarter with revenue of $8.5 billion
, up 
18% year
-
over
-
year and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week; 
that is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we 
experienced in the September quarter.
 
The App Store set a new all
-

-
new design 
i
s off to a fantastic start with quarterly store visitors, transacting accounts 
and paying accounts, reaching new all
-
time highs. During the week 
beginning December 24th, a record number of customers made purchases or 
downloaded Apps from the App Store, spe
nding over $890 million in that 
seven
-

alone.
 

the preferred destination for customer purchases by a very wide margi
n, 
generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. Across all our services 
offerings, paid subscriptions reached $240 million with growth of 58% over 
last year and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth in 
services revenue.
 
As Tim m
entioned, it was our best quarter ever for Apple Watch. And when 
we add the results from Beats and AirPods, our total revenue from 
wearables was up almost 70% year
-
over
-
year. In fact, wearables were the 
second largest contributor to revenue growth after iP
hone, which is 
impressive for a business that started only three years ago. In total, our 
other products category set a new all
-
time record with quarterly revenue 
exceeding $5 billion for the first time.
 

llion Macs during the 
December quarter, which translates to 2% year
-
over
-
year increase in 
average sales per week. Mac performance was particularly strong in 
emerging markets with unit sales up 13% year
-
over
-
year and with all
-
time 
records in Latin America, 
in India, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. 
On a worldwide basis, the active install base of Macs was up double
-
digits 
year
-
over
-
year to a new record.
 
It was also another growth quarter for iPad. We sold 13.2 million units with 
average iPad sales per 

sales grew strong double
-
digits in many emerging markets, including Latin 
America, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe and India, as well as 
developed markets, including Japan, Australia and Korea.
 
The active install 
base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it 
reached a new all
-
time high in December, thanks to extremely high 
customer loyalty and large numbers of first
-
time iPad users.
 
NPD indicates that iPad had 46% share o
f the U.S. tablet market in the 
December quarter, up from 36% share a year ago. And the most recent 
surveys from 451 Research found that among customers planning to 
purchase tablets within 90 days, 72% of consumers and 68% of business 
users planned to purc
hase iPads. Customer satisfaction is also very high with 
businesses reporting a 99% satisfaction rating for iPad.
 
We are seeing great traction in enterprise as businesses across industries 
and around the world standardize on iOS. For example, Intesa Sanpao
lo, 

entire 70,000 employee base in Italy; choosing iOS for its security, user 
interface, accessibility and reliability, Intesa Sanpaolo will deploy native apps 
to improve employee
 
productivity in customer support, human resources, 
and marketing across the company.
 
And LensCrafters, one of the largest optical retail brands in North America, 
will be using over 7,000 iPad Pros to enable digital eye exams and digital 
optical measuremen

also rolling out a new initiative, called Apple at Work to help businesses 
implement employee choice programs more easily and offer Apple products 
company
-
wide.
 
Resources from both Apple and our channe
l partners will enable enterprise 
IT and procurement teams to buy or lease Apple products more efficiently, 
streamline the setup of iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and deliver a seamless 
onboarding experience for employees. We launched the program with CDW 
in the U
.S. last week, and we would be expanding to more channels and 
regions later this year.
 
The December quarter was extremely busy for our retail and online stores, 
which welcomed 538 million visitors. Traffic was particularly strong during 
the four
-
weeks foll
owing the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year. And 
across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple 
sessions, covering topics including photography, music, gaming, and app 
development, and art and design. Just last weekend, we ope
ned our first 

Austria in a few weeks. These newest openings will mark the expansion of 
our retail store presence to 21 countries.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended t
he quarter with $285.1 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $16.2 
billion. $269 billion of this cash, or 94% of the total, was outside the United 
States. We issued $7 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $110 
b
illion in term
-
debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a 
total net cash position of $163 billion at the end of the quarter. We also 
returned $14.5 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 billion in 
dividends and equivalents,
 
and spent $5.1 billion on repurchases of 30.2 
million Apple shares through open market transactions.
 
We launched a new $5 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and 
retirement of 23.6 million shares and we retired 3.8 million shares upon the 
c

$248 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $176 billion 
in share repurchases against our announced $210 billion buyback program 
with $34 billion remaining under 
our current authorization.
 
Turning to taxes. Due to the recently enacted legislation in the U.S., we 
estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 
billion to the U.S. government on our cumulative past foreign earnings. This 
amount is 
very similar to what we had been accruing on those earnings in 
our financial results through fiscal year 2017. Including the $38 billion 
payment, we will have paid over $110 billion of corporate income tax on our 
total domestic and foreign earnings during 
the last 10 years for a cash tax 
rate of about 26%.
 
Our tax rate of 25.8% for the December quarter was close to our guidance 
of 25.5% as the lower U.S. statutory rate from the new legislation was 
effectively offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax bala
nces.
 
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call; we expect revenue to be between $60 billion 
and $62 billion; we 
expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%; we 
expect OpEx to be between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion; we expect OI&E to 
be about $300 million; and we expect the tax rate to be about 15%.
 
Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital stru
cture for our 
company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion. And given the 
increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign 
cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. 
We will provide an
 
update to our specific capital allocation plans when we 
report results for our second fiscal quarter, consistent with the timing of 
updates that we have provided in the past.
 
Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 
per 
share of common stock, payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders 
of record as of February 12, 2018.

Thank you. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross 
Research.
 
Shannon Cross
 
Luca, I wanted to talk a little bit about, more about your comments on 
capital
 
structure. I realize you don't want to give any specifics about what 
you're actually going to return in the timing. But just maybe if you can talk 
about how much cash you think you need to have here on the business? And 
then in terms of ongoing cash flow,
 
since toe overseas cash flow no longer 
be encumbered, does that change your thought process, in general? And 
then I have a follow up. Thank you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Of course, we've been talking about the importance of tax reform over the 
years, because we belie
ve it's really beneficial to the U.S. economy. What it 
means to us as a company of course is that, we have additional flexibility 
right now from the access to the foreign cash. And in the past, we've been 
addressing this issue by having to raise debt as th
e cash was overseas; the 
majority of the cash was overseas.
 
And so we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash, we've 
got $122 billion of debt for a net cash of $163 billion. We have now the 
flexibility to deploy this capital. We will do th
at overtime, because the 
amount is very large. As I said earlier, we will be discussing capital allocation 
plans when we review our March quarter results. And when you look at our 

tha
t effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of

about the potential decay rate, for lack

so much when you launched your phones in 2017? Thank you.
 
TimCook
 
The rev
enue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in 
the double
-
digits. And I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that for 

quarter for iPhone. The iPhone X was t



getting into supply demand balance there in December. But since the launch 
of iPhone
 
X, it has been the most popular iPhone every week, every week 
sales. And that is even through today, actually through January.
 
And so we feel fantastic about the results. The most important thing for us is 

n. And customer satisfaction 
is literally off the charts on iPhone X. We think about the advances in 
technology that were a part of the iPhone X from 
--
 
we went from Touch ID 
to Face ID; Face ID has been incredibly well received; the wireless charging, 
the
 
edge to edge super retina display; and totally new gestures, the user 

 
If you look at the the overall iPhone line to get to the essence of the 
question, I think. I looked 
--
 
I reviewe

briefly about the top four. In Urban China and the U.S., the top five 
smartphones last quarter were all iPhones. And in Japan and the UK, six of 
the top seven were iPhones. And so in a market that is as large as the 
smartp

deciding which ones to buy. But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains 
to iPhone X.

Katy Huberty
 
Growing double
-
digits of such a 
large revenue base is impressive in itself. 
But if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average 
weekly growth in total revenue, as well as, I think on my math, iPhone 
shipments when you compare it to the December quarter. So just how 
s
hould we read into a modest slowdown in average weekly growth as it 
relates to the last question around the decay of demand around the higher 
priced products? Or any impact that you might be seeing from the lower
-
priced battery replacements or anything els
e in the market? And then I have 
a follow
-
up.
 
Luca Maestri
 
We are guiding to $62 billion. It's a strong double
-
digit growth, 13% to 
17%. In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year. So when you put 
things in perspective and you add the $10 bi
llion of growth that we had in 
the first quarter and the $7 billion to $9 billion that we're guiding to for the 
second quarter, you're talking about $17 billion to $19 billion of growth in six 
months. This is at the macro level.
 
We typically don't go into 
this level of detail, but think it's important this 
quarter to give you additional color. And maybe the two most important 
messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as 
compared to last year, during the March quarter. And also and 
importantly 
that iPhone sell
-
through growth on a year
-
over
-
year basis will be actually 
accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December 
quarter.
 
Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up 
with our iPhone units
 
and ASP that are embedded in our guidance. 
Historically, because the channel fill and the holiday season, our selling 
volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell
-
through. 
This year, the difference was further magnified, because we shi
pped iPhone 
X in November rather than the September quarter. We had a very successful 
product ramp. We were able to reach supply/demand balance in December, 
which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1 and this will 
have an effect on bo
th units and ASP in Q2.
 
Now, for units, there is a second point to consider. We typically reduced 
channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2, because they enjoy very 
large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the 
holiday season in Q1. So we anticipate
 
doing that in Q2 this year as well. For 
ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. As you know, 
our newest products this year have a higher ASP than they had in the past. 
And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest produ
cts, the 
overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher 
percentage than we have experienced historically.
 
So in summary, our guidance for iPhone; we got double digit year
-
over
-
year 
growth and acceleration of sell
-
through grow
th on a year
-
over
-
year basis. 
For the balance of the Company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong 
double
-
digits year
-
over
-
year and particularly very strong performance in 

hope t
his helps.
 
Katy Huberty
 
Yes, that's great color. Just a follow
-
up on gross margin. Guidance for flat 
gross margin in March is pretty seasonal, but you do have the tailwind from 
currency. And so if you can just comment on how you think that flows into 
the m
odel over the next couple of quarters, the weaker dollar. And what 
your outlook might be around component costs in the near future. Thank 
you.
 
Luca Maestri
 

sequentially in spite of t
he loss of leverage. That is the largest element that 
we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. And we 
expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with 
mix. FX on a sequential basis is fairly muted, because as 
you know, we've 
got a hedging program that protects us from the volatility of currencies in 
the short term.
 
Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive but it's 
not something that you're going to be seeing translating to gros
s margin 
tailwind quickly. And so I think we need to keep that in mind. We also need 
to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing 
environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the 
second half of our fi
scal year. But it still has a negative impact in the March 
quarter.
 
Operator
 
Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray has our next question.
 
Mike Olson
 
I know you don't talk about future products, which is often presses to 
questions about future products and I'll giv
e it a shot. When you think 
conceptually about the path for iPhone X Style devices going forward. Is 

seen with past iPhone upgrades? In other words, the 10 was unique 
amongst recen
t iPhone launches, because it's a singular device, potentially 
limiting the shots on go for upgrades given limited options. How do you 
think about that, going forward? And then I have a follow up.
 
TimCook
 
Mike, you did a good job of answering your question
. I think at the 


launched it, we were setting up the next decade. And that is how we look at 
it. And so t
hat's the reason it's chockfull of incredible innovation. And so you 
can bet that we're pulling that string.
 
Mike Olson
 
And then how you're think about AR beyond iPhone? You've created the 
world's largest AR platform. You've got developers generating a wid
e variety 
of apps. I realized it's still early days. But do you see Apple as a provider of 
a larger ecosystem of AR
-
enabled device beyond iPhone and iPad in the 
coming years? Or should investors focus on the opportunity within your 
existing device portfoli
o for at least the foreseeable future? Thanks.
 
TimCook
 
I see AR as being profound. I think, AR has the ability to amplify human 
performance instead of isolating humans. And so I am a huge, huge believer 
in AR. We put a lot of energy on AR removing very fas
t. We've gone from 
ARkit 1.0 to 1.5 in just a matter of months. I couldn't be happier with the 
rate and face of the developer community, how faster developing these 

with how things 
are going right now.
 
Operator
 

 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
I have a question and follow
-
up. You commented on how your install based 
over the last couple of years has grown 30%. And iPhone is clearly the 
largest compo
nent of that, and so iPhone install base is probably growing 
close to that number perhaps last, call it 20% through 25%. Yet, if we look 


flat. So you have an install base 

suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is 

in
vestors should be worried about that. And maybe if I could just add one 

heightened awareness of their ability to replace batteries going forward as 

something that investors should 
potentially be concerned about in terms of its impact on upgrade rate going 
forward? And then believe or not, I have a follow
-
up.
 
TimCook
 
This is up to investors as to what things they would like to focus on, so I 

 
to put myself in the position of that. The way that I look at this 

what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic. The second 
or the previously owned market has 
expanded in units over the years. And 
you see in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs 
around trading an iPhone in. And because iPhone has the largest residual 
rate on it, it acts as a buffer for the customer to buy new one and it
 
lines up 
with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a 
previously owned iPhone.
 

iPhones the better. I would like to point out that the ever year major pro
duct 


of the 
--
 
or the vast majority of the services are mapped to the install base 
instead of the qua
rterly sales. And this quarter is no different on that.
 
On the battery, Toni, we did not consider in any way, shape, or form, what it 
would do to upgrade rates. We did it because we thought it was the right 
thing to do for our customers. And sitting here t
oday, I don't know what 

--
 
was not in our thought process of 
deciding to do what we've done.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
And just a follow
-
up, maybe I could clarify two little things. One, Luca, on 
tax rate, you talked about 15
% for Q2. Is that how we should think about 
the tax rate on an ongoing basis? And then just back to you on your 
response, Tim, I guess maybe you could just comment on whether you 
believe the upgrade rate has decreased over the last couple of years, 
because
 
again, just mechanically install base is growing 20 and units are 
relatively flat over that period. Isn't that telling the install base is 
--
 
upgrade 
rate is going down, or am I not thinking about other considerations? Thank 
you.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Toni, on 
the tax rate, I will make two comments. First of all, the new tax law 
in the United States is complex. And I think we, as many other companies, 
are really trying to absorb what this all means. And I think we're going to be 
receiving, over the next few mont
hs, implementation guidance. So we've 
taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the 
quarter, and we will have to do that as we go forward here during the year. 
So it may be a bit bumpy in the short
-
term as we understand the law
 
in full, 
and it actually gets explained in full.
 
But I would say that for the current fiscal year, the guidance that we 
provided for Q2 should be approximately what you should be seeing. As we 
get into new fiscal year, so many things change and we need to
 
take that 
into account, the geographic mix of our products and so on. But I would say 

 
Tim Cook
 
I think on the replacement cycle, Toni, the answer is, probably looks 
different by geography. In those 
geographies that had, in the early days of 
the smartphone market, had very traditional subsidies where you paid $199 
out the door or $99 or whatever. I think it's accurate to save those type of 
markets. The replacement cycle is likely longer.
 
Where that is
n't the case, I am not nearly as sure on that. I would point out 
that that happened some time ago and so it's very difficult currently to ever 
get a real time handle on replacement rate, because you obviously not 
--
 
you don't know the replacement rate for 
the products you're currently 
selling, you only know that in an historical sense. So it's not something that 
we are overly fixate on.
 
Operator
 
Next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham.
 
Laura Martin
 
I love the 1.3 billion devices you gave us, upda
ting from two years ago. And 

we have more unique users in that 1.3 billion than we had unique users back 
there in 2016?
 
Tim Cook
 
Laura, I missed the first part of that, you broke up
 
on the phone.
 
Laura Martin
 
So we have 1.3 billion [technical difficulty] unique users or I mean fewer 
products, so we have a higher percentage of unique [users] in the 1.3 
devices and more in the billion devices. Is it a [technical difficulty] are 

 
Tim Cook
 
Laura, you're cutting in and out. But I'm going to take a swing at what I 
think you're asking. I think you're asking, are there more active users today 
than there were two years ago when we had 1 billion active devices. And the 
answer is absolutel
y, there are many, many more.
 
Laura Martin
 
Yes, I was asking as a percent, the ownership. You see 1.4 billion devices 
owned per person. Do you think it's now 1.2 billion or 1.6 billion?
 
Tim Cook
 
Well, that 1.4 billion, I don't know where that came from. It
 
did not come 
from Apple. And so that's one of the things that kind of flowed out there. 

number, because we think that the proper way to look at it is to look at 
active devices. It's 
also the one that is the most accurate for us to measure. 
And so that's our thinking behind there.
 
Laura Martin
 
Switchers in the quarter, you often give us switchers.
 
Tim Cook
 
It is so early on this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone X only 
starti
ng in November that we do not feel we have data at this point that 
would be very meaningful to share. And so I'll pump that question until next 
time around.
 
Operator
 
Next we'll go to Steve Milunovich from UBS.
 
Steve Milunovich
 
Tim, you said you don't want 
to tell investors what to do. But the first point 
you made was talking about the size of the install base. Later you've talked 
about the importance of customer satisfaction. Given that this doesn't look 
like a super
-
cycle in terms of unit growth, are you n
udging us to focus on 
the size of the install base, the annuity opportunity here? And do you have 
confidence that you can monetize that install base through additional 
hardware and services?
 
Tim Cook
 
What I said on the investor part is that I think 
every investor has to look at 
their own situation and conclude the things that they think are important. 
What I think is important, I think the active devices are hugely important 
and that's the reason that we released the number two years ago, and the 
rea

strength of the product the loyalty of the customer, the strength of the 
ecosystem.
 
And so we do put a lot of weight behind that. And it obviously also fuels the 
services business. So I h
ave long believed that on 90 day clock on unit sales 
is a very surface way to view Apple. I think that the far bigger thing is to 
look over a longer period of time. And customer satisfaction and 
engagement and number of active devices are all part of that.
 
Steve Milunovich
 
And could you address the positioning of HomePod? What category is it in, is 
it a music speaker, is it a home system, since people seem to be trying to 

primarily A
pple Music users?
 
Tim Cook
 
HomePod is an incredible product that is a unbelievable audio experience in 
a very small form factor with a super digital assistant in Siri that knows an 
enormous amount of music. But also can handle request to like home 
automati
on to close your garage door, open your door, turn the light on, 
turn the fireplace on, change the thermostat, all of the things that you would 
like to do in home automation. But takes it further, because we think do it 
right from the home app instead of s

reading and your room will change to the things you would like happening in 


.
 
It also, obviously, you can also do things with HomePod like use it as a 

their grand kids, its unbelievable audio quality for speaker phone. You can 
also have Siri call for you
, you can send messages, you can get a Uber car or 
a Lyft car. And so there is just a whole variety of things. And so I think the 
use cases on this much like our phones will be broad based. Some people 
will use it significantly for music and others may use
 
it significantly for as a 
digital assistance; and I think the majority of people will likely use all of it 
and use all of the functionality of it.

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
I have two que
stions as well. I guess first one. Could you just touch on what 

growth was up double
-
digit year
-
over
-
year but essentially in line to what 
you saw in September. I would have thought th
at would have accelerated a 
little bit with iPhone X. Just the puts and takes in China will be great.
 
Tim Cook
 

had 14 weeks. And so even though we were reporting a similar year
-
over
-
year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average 
weekly sales, which probably is much better way to look at it, there was 
actually a really nice acceleration. And specifically the numbers this quarter 
as reported are 11% increase f
or Greater China year
-
over
-
year but on an 
average weekly revenue basis, we were up 19%.
 
Also Mainland China, we had an all
-
time record for revenue in Mainland 

before, Kantar reported
 
that the top five selling smartphones in urban China 
were all iPhones. And so we could not be more pleased with how we're 
doing. And if you look at the other 
--
 
we obviously grew share for iPhone in 
the quarter, but we also grew share in iPad and Mac duri
ng the quarter and 
wearables were extremely strong there in the quarter. And so everywhere I 
look, I feel really good about how we're doing in China.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Luca, maybe a question for you. When you talked about reducing Apple's net 
cash levels to z
ero effectively over time, I think that implies 
--
 
the number 
goes from $163 billion today to something like zero. What does over time 
mean for Apple? Is that one year, three years, 10 years, or how do you 
define over time? And does this change your though
ts around M&A at all, 
and is that one reason to get that number from $163 billion to zero. Does it 
change your M&A thought process?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Let me answer, Amit, starting with M&A. Our thought process around M&A 
has always been the same, and really doe
sn't change. We've been acquiring 
companies over the years. In calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies. 
And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to 
either accelerate our product roadmaps, filling gap in our portfolio, provid
ing 
a new experience to customers. So it's always with the customer experience 
in mind that we make acquisitions.
 
We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. We have plenty of 
financial flexibility, of course. We had that even prior to tax reform.
 
And as I 
said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report at the March 
quarter and that will include talking about timeframes and pace and so on. 

large amount and 
there are even practical considerations around it. So we'll 
see.
 
Tim Cook
 
And just for clarity, let me add one thing. What Luca is saying is not cash 
equals zero. He's saying there's an equal amount cash and debt, and that 
they balance to zero. Just for cl
arity.

time quarterly 
records for i
Phone and iPad sales and had one of our best Mac quarters ever, 

We were also very pleased with our results in emerging markets around the 
world.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $57.
6 billion, up $3.1 billion, or 6%, from the 
year ago quarter and near the high end of our guidance range. No 
technology company has ever generated that much revenue in a single 

for
eign exchange headwinds, the year over year decline in iPod sales, and 
the higher revenue deferral rates from iOS devices and Macs that we 
discussed last quarter.
 
These three factors negatively impacted revenue by about $2.5 billion, and 
without them, our 
year over year revenue growth would have been about 
10%. Gross margin was 37.9%, above the high end of our guidance range, 
and operating margin was an all
-
time record of $17.5 billion, representing 
30.3% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, translatin
g to diluted 
earnings per share of $14.50, a new record.
 

constraints on iPhone 5S, we sold 51 million iPhones compared to 47.8 

ase of over 3 million phones, 
or 7%, and a new quarterly record.
 
iPhone sales growth was very strong year over year in Japan, thanks to the 
addition of NTT Docomo in September and our continued partnership with 
Softbank and KDDI. In fact, based on the late
st data published by Kantar, 
iPhone accounts for 69% share of the smartphone market in Japan.
 
We also generated strong year over year iPhone growth in greater China, 
Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia. In the U.S. market, Apple 
remains the leading 
smartphone manufacturer, with iPhone accounting for 
41% of smartphone subscribers in the three
-
month period ending in 
November, according to ComScore.
 

Mobile, the largest network in the wo
rld, with over 750 million customers, 
and to be selling iPhones through their expansive network of stores, 
beginning on January 17. China is an incredibly important market to Apple, 
and iOS devices already account for 57% of all mobile web browsing in 
Chin
a.
 
iPhone customers are loving their phones, and continue to produce the 
highest loyalty rates in the industry. A December survey of U.S. customers 
by ChangeWave indicated a 96% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone. And 
based on the latest data provided b
y Kantar, iPhone customers have a 90% 
loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition.
 
We exited the quarter with about 15.3 million total iPhones in channel 
inventory, which represented a sequential increase of less than 1 million 
units from the S
eptember quarter, and left us within our target range of 4 to 
6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
 
The release of new iPhones with iOS 7 introduced powerful new security and 
management features for business and enterprise customers. And iOS 7 has 
received 
FIPS 140
-
2 certification from the U.S. federal government. These 
features, coupled with ease of developing custom enterprise apps, continue 
to make iPhone the device of choice for large organizations.
 
Many companies, including Accenture, Cisco, and America
n Airlines, have 
tens of thousands of employees using iPhones for work. In fact, some, 
including Deloitte and GE, have over 50,000 iPhones each on their networks 
around the world. And based on the latest data published by IDC, combining 
business, governmen
t, and education institutions, iPhone has a 59% share 
of the U.S. commercial smartphone market.
 
Turning to iPad, despite supply constraints, we sold over 26 million iPads 

an incre
ase of over 3 million iPads, or 14%, and represents a new all
-
time 
quarterly sales record.
 
iPad sales were very robust in Mainland China, where sales more than 
doubled year over year. We also experienced strong iPad sales growth in the 
Middle East, Latin A
merica, Russia, and parts of Western Europe.
 
Customers are loving the new iPad Air and iPad Mini, with Retina Display, 
introduced in October, and response to the more affordable iPad Mini has 
been very strong. In fact, a November ChangeWave survey of custo
mers 
planning to buy a tablet within 90 days found that 72% plan to purchase an 
iPad. And among customers who already owned an iPad, the survey 
measured a 97% satisfaction rate.
 
We exited the quarter with 6.2 million units of iPad channel inventory, a 
sequ
ential increase of about 2.1 million units, which placed us within our 
target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory.
 
Based on the latest data published by IDC, iPad has a 78% share of the U.S. 
commercial tablet market, and iPad continues to spark
 
innovation for 
businesses around the world. Leveraging custom developed and App Store 
apps, progressive IT organizations have embraced mobility, armed 
employees with iPad, and fundamentally changed the way people do their 
jobs.
 
British Airways has deploye
d thousands of iPads to their employees across 
the business, including senior cabin staff, engineers, check
-
in staff, pilots, 
and ground crew. At Kindred Healthcare, iPads are now being used by the 
sales team, executives, and thousands of therapists nation
wide, resulting in 
millions of dollars of estimated savings and productivity gains for Kindred 
and their customers.
 
And this football season, nearly every team in the NFL use iPads as 
playbooks, replacing their traditional three
-
ring paper binders. In the 
education market, schools continue to choose iPad and the great content 
available across apps, books, and courses. To date, U.S. educational 

750,000 iPads to K
-
12 schools in the sta
te of Texas alone, including 7,000 
iPads rolling out to all K
-
12 students in the Midway Independent School 
District.
 
We have expanded the availability of iBook textbooks in four countries to 
over 50 countries, so that students and teachers around the world
 
can 
experience the power of what a textbook can be. We continue to add new 
titles from key education publishers like Oxford University Press and 
Cambridge University Press. In addition, nearly 25,000 books have been 
created and published by individual edu
cators using iBooks Author, bringing 
lessons to life in exciting new ways.
 
And over 1,000 institutions are delivering courses and content through 
iTunes U. At the Ohio State University, where there are over 20,000 iPads on 
campus, faculty have developed ov
er 70 iTunes U courses in less than one 
school year.
 
We remain very focused on providing a great user experience for our iPhone 

continues to lead the industry in user 

Digital Analytics Benchmark, iOS devices accounted for more than twice the 
online traffic and more than five times the online sales compared to Android 
devices on both Black Friday and Christmas Day.
 
IBM reported that iOS dev
ices represented 32.6% of online traffic on 
December 25, and more than double the 14.8% for Android. While iOS 
devices drove 23% of online sales that day, 5x the 4.6% for Android. And, 
according to the latest reports by TechInsights, iPhone accounted for 5
4% of 
North American smartphone web traffic, while iPad accounted for 78% of 
tablet traffic.
 
These usage percentages are far greater than the share of the smartphone 
and tablet markets represented by our devices, and they underscore just 
how engaging and i
mportant our iPhones and iPads are to the people who 
own them.
 

month, 80% of iOS devices are running iOS 7. That dwarfs the single
-
digit 
adoption percentage measured for the latest v
ersion of the Android 
operating system, and makes iOS 7 the most popular operating system in 
the world. The rapid transition to the latest version of iOS provides a more 
advanced and secure experience for our customers, and a more streamlined 
opportunity f
or our developers.
 
Turning to Mac, we sold 4.8 million Macs, compared to 4.1 million in the year 
ago quarter, an increase of 19%, making this among our best Mac quarters 
ever. The growth was driven by significantly increased sales of iMac and 
Macbook Air, 
while sales of Macbook Pro also remained strong.
 
Mac sales grew in each of our operating segments, led by Europe and 
greater China. We were also very pleased to have generated such strong 

 
published 
estimate of a 6% year over year contraction in worldwide personal computer 
sales. Macs have now gained global market share for 30 of the last 31 
quarters.
 
We were happy to begin selling the all
-
new Mac Pro last month, 
manufactured in the U.S., a
nd we had great customer response to OS X 
Mavericks, now available for free and running on millions of Macs around the 
world. And we were also delighted to be providing our groundbreaking iWork 
productivity apps for free of charge to our Mac, iPhone, and i
Pad customers. 
We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was within our 4
-
5 
week target range.
 
30 years ago this week, Apple launched the Macintosh. Not only was the 
Macintosh a breakthrough for the personal computer, it was also a promise 
that 
the power of technology taken from the few and put in the hands of 
everyone could change the world. Over the past 30 years, people have done 
extraordinary things with the Mac, and with the Apple products it inspired.
 

e taken a look at what people have 
accomplished on a special website that showcases their Mac stories. Their 

deliver the best technology to people all over the world, every day. Happy 
Birthday, Mac. Imagine what we can accomplish in the next 30 years.
 
We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and 
services and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Total revenue from iTunes 
software and services was $4.4 billion, an
 
increase of 19% year over year. 
Our iTunes stores generated record billings of $4.7 billion in the December 
quarter, thanks primarily to strong growth in App Store sales.
 
The quarter of iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over 
$2.4 b
illion, up 14% from the year ago quarter, and a new all
-
time record. 
Software and services revenue was about $2 billion, up 26% from the year 
ago quarter, and also a new record. We achieved these records despite the 
fact we are now making iPhoto, iMovie, P
ages, Numbers, and Keynote free 

iWork free to our Mac customers.
 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are now deferring a greater amount of 
revenue for each new iOS device and Mac sold 
as a result of the free 
software and associated upgrade rights. At the end of the quarter, our total 
deferred revenue from all sources was $11.4 billion, and we expect to realize 
$8.4 billion of it in the next four quarters.
 
The App Store now offers 1 mill
ion apps in 24 categories and cumulative 
downloads have surpassed 65 billion. Our app developers earned 2 billion 
from sales in the App Store in the December quarter. That translates to $15 
billion in cumulative App Store earnings for our developers, about
 
half of 
which was generated in the last four quarters, and we are thrilled with the 
success that they have achieved.
 
In China specifically, we have an incredibly vibrant iOS and Mac developer 
community. Developers in China have created over 130,000 apps o
n the App 
Store to date. A recent study by Business Insider Intelligence indicated that 
iOS has a 5x advantage over Android when it comes to developer revenue 
per app download, a 4x advantage in revenue from in
-
app purchases, and a 
2x advantage in revenue 
from paid downloads plus in
-
app purchases.
 
And according to a recent report from Distimo, the App Store has a 63% to 
37% market share advantage over Google Play in global revenue from apps. 
Top developers continue to launch their apps first, or exclusively
, on the App 
Store.
 
Examples of highly successful launches from 2013 include Temple Run 2 and 
Cut The Rope 2, which generated millions of downloads in multiweek periods 
of App Store exclusivity. NaturalMotion recently launched Clumsy Ninja 
exclusively on i
OS and saw 10 million downloads in the first week. And 
Plants Versus Zombies 2 resulted in the biggest game title launch ever for 

the first five days alone.
 
With the introduction of 
iOS 7, developers are able to create stunning apps 
to take advantage of the redesigned user interface and more than 200 new 

including Candy Crush Saga, Puzzle & Dragons, Minecraft, Qu
izUp, and 
Clumsy Ninja, were created by international developers.
 
The seamless integration of the iOS platform, the global reach of our 
ecosystem, our thoughtful app review process, and our highly engaged 
customers continue to make the App Store a superior
 
marketplace for our 
extremely talented developer community.
 

$7 billion, a new quarterly record, and in increase of 9% from the year ago 
quarter. The growth was fueled by record i
Phone and iPad sales through the 
stores as well as strong Mac sales.
 
We completed the remodel of six stores and opened four new stores during 
the quarter, ending with a total of 420 stores, including 166 outside the 
United States. With an average of 418 st
ores open during the December 
quarter, average revenue per store was $16.7 million, compared to $16.3 
million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.7 billion.
 
We hosted 114 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which 
translates
 
to almost 21,000 visitors per store, per week. We were excited to 
roll out iBeacon technology at our stores in the U.S. during the quarter, 
enabling shoppers to receive iPhone notifications about products and 
services via the Apple Store app.
 
iBeacon tran

exact location inside an Apple Store and send messages based on the aisle 
or product the customer is near. For example, customers walking by an 
iPhone table could receive a message offering to
 
help them check their 
upgrade eligibility or trade
-
in value of an existing phone. We expect to see 
many innovative uses of iBeacon technology from other businesses and 
developers in the coming months, including retailers and professional sports.
 
Total com
pany operating expenses were $4.4 billion, and included $572 
million in stock based compensation expense, aligning with $246 million, and 
the tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%. And turning to our cash, we ended 
the quarter with $158.8 billion in cash or s
hort term and long term 
marketable securities, a sequential increase of $12 billion from the 
September quarter.
 
Our domestic cash was $34.4 billion at the end of the December quarter, a 
sequential decline of $1.1 billion. $124.4 billion, or 78%, of our tot
al cash 
was offshore at the end of the December quarter, and cash flow from 
operations was $22.7 billion.
 
We paid $2.7 billion in dividends in the quarter, and we executed an 
additional $5 billion in repurchases of 9.6 million shares of Apple stock 
during 
the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of over $43 billion in 
payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last six quarters, of 
which share buybacks were $28 billion. This has resulted in Q1 retirement of 
56.5 million shares and repres
ents 6% of the total shares outstanding prior 
to the launch of the repurchase program.
 
Our board of directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share, 
payable on February 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of the close of 
business on February

-
looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
 
We expect revenue to be between $42 billion and $44 billion,
 
compared to 
$43.6 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 
37% and 38%, reflecting approximately $110 million related to stock based 
compensation expense. We expect opex to be between $4.3 billion and $4.4 
billion, including a
bout $590 million related to stock based compensation.
 
We are continuing to invest heavily in R&D, in both current revenue 
generating categories as well as future products and services. We expect 
OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to
 
be about 
26.2%.
 
In closing, we are very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, the 
strong performance of our Mac products, and the growth of iTunes software 
and services revenue. We are thrilled to have the most satisfied, loyal, and 
engaged customers in our industry, and we are confidently working to make 
the user experience even better for them. We are continuing to invest 
heavily in our future, and remain very confident in our new product pipeline.

you experienced in the March 2013 quarter, and I think implies iPhone units 
may not grow in the March quarter year on year. So 
can you just talk about 

 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
The biggest reason for the larger sequential decline in revenue this year 

through s


that the underlying performance of our business is stronger than what the 
guidance might imply.
 
We expect four fa
ctors to negatively impact the year over year revenue 
comparison by over $2 billion. These are channel inventory increases in the 

U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, part
icularly the yen and the 
Australian dollar, and the higher per unit deferral for Mac and iOS devices 
that I talked about in my prepared remarks.
 
Let me go through these a little more. First, beginning with channel 
inventory, in the March quarter last year,
 
we increased channel inventory for 
both iPhone and iPad, whereas this year we increased the channel inventory 
for both product families in the December quarter, and we exited within our 
target range of channel inventory.
 
For iPhone, specifically last year
, the supply of iPhone 5 was short for the 
entire December quarter, and we were not able to achieve supply and 
demand balance for iPhone 5 until the March quarter. As a result, we 
increased the iPhone inventory last year by about 1.1 million units.
 
In cont
rast, this year we executed the fastest rollout for our new iPhones, 
and we included China in wave one, in the launch in September, and we 
were able to exit the quarter in supply and demand balance.
 
For iPad, we introduced the Mini in the December quarter 
last year, and we 

supply and demand balance for the iPad Mini until the March quarter last 
year, and we increased inventory in the March quarter by 1.4 million units. 
In contrast, thi
s year we exited the December quarter near supply and 
demand balance.
 
So looking past the inventory changes year
-
to
-
year, we expect the value of 


 
Turning to
 
iPod, sales declined by 52% year over year in the December 
quarter, and we would expect them to continue to decline year over year in 
the March quarter. And FX is a headwind for us with the strengthening dollar 
against a number of currencies. So when you 

very pleased with the underlying performance of the business and the 
revenue growth is stronger than what the guidance might imply.

downtick. Are there any one

time items in SG&A and R&D in the March 
quarter? Or is the run rate reflective of investments for future opportunities?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

detai
ls.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, at the midpoint of the range of our guidance, we are expecting a minor 
decrease of $50 million. This is largely due to the lower variable expenses 

revenue. But 
one thing that Peter already mentioned in his remarks is that 
we continue to invest very heavily in R&D. We make investments in areas 
that are visible to all of you today, but also in areas that are not visible, 

things that are not visible to 
you, obviously were impacting ahead of the revenue that these products and 
services will generate in the future. So there is nothing that is one

nature in our guidance.

I have a question on the revenue guidance as well. The ramp of China

large carrier ramps?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

be working with China Mobile, and Docomo also. We had a great launch with 
both carriers, Docomo in the December quarter and China Mobile just in the 
last couple of weeks. These carrie
r additions will have a positive impact on 

in 16 cities today, and they plan to complete the rollout of more than 
500,000 4G base stations, which will cover more than 340 cities b
y year
-
end.
 
With the addition of Docomo last quarter, we were able to achieve 69% 

benefit of these two carrier additions this quarter is being partially offset by 
a couple of things:
 
first of all, the comparison last year from our late launch 
of the iPhone 5 and the new iPad in Mainland China, achieving supply and 
demand balance for the Mini and the iMac in the March quarter, and the 

 
also deferring more 
revenue on the iOS devices and Mac.
 


that are offsetting it, that we factored into the 
guidance.
 
Tim Cook
 



just sellin
g in 16 cities with China Mobile, and as Peter alluded to, this 
number is projected to be over 300 cities by the end of this year. And so 

 
This comes after a new high water mark in China
 
for us last quarter. We 
grew revenues including our retail stores at 31%, and we had some very, 
very strong sales on iPad. iPads in greater China were up 64% year over 

growing at 21%
 
per IDC, and a PC market that is contracting by 7%. And so 

looking there, we really turned in a stellar quarter in greater China overall, 
and we are very proud of it.

I have one for Tim, and then
 
a follow up, please. Tim, I wanted to just step 


its iPhone units about 20%. The market grew in the 4
0s. I think this quarter, 
even with a new product and having China front loaded, the iPhone is going 
to grow at a fraction of ultimately what the market is likely to grow at.
 
And I know your belief and philosophy historically has been that you want to 
make
 



quarters in Mac. But in iPhone, that is
 
not happening.
 
And so my question is, what is different about the smartphone market that 
is not allowing you to hold or gain unit share despite apparently having the 
best product, and do you propose to do anything differently going forward, 
because I thin



 
Tim Cook
 

lways been to make the best, not the 

announced two iPhones for the first time, rather than one. And looking at 
last quarter, if you looked at our sell through 
-
 
so not sell in, bu
t the sell 
through 
-
 

phone, with the 5S, all of those grew year over year versus the phones that 
were in those categories previously.
 
If you look at the emerging markets, which is one of the
 

alluded to that we have to grow in these areas and grow at reasonable 
amounts, in Latin America we grew at 76% year over year. In the Middle 
East and Africa, we grew at 65%. In central and eastern Europe, we grew 
115%. In China, we grew a
t 20%. However, as you know, we just added 
China Mobile, the largest carrier there, in this quarter, and did not have 
channel load in China Mobile last quarter. We just started selling those in 
January.
 

ere up 40%. Now, 
when you translate that performance into revenue in Japan, and we have 
the issue with the yen that Peter spoke about earlier, and so the revenue 
growth looks much less than that, because of the strength of the dollar 
there.
 
In North 
America, we did not do as well, and this weighed our results. Our 
North American business contracted somewhat year over year. And if you 
look at the reason for this, one was that as we entered the quarter, and 
forecasted our iPhone sales, where we achieved
 
what we thought, we 
actually sold more iPhone 5Ss than we projected.
 
And so the mix was stronger to the 5S, and it took us some amount of time 
in order to build the mix that customers were demanding. And as a result, 
we lost some sort of units for part of
 
the quarter in North America and 
relative to the world, it took us the bulk of the quarter, almost all the 
quarter, to get the iPhone 5S into proper supply.
 
The other thing that happened in North America specifically was that some 
carriers changed their u
pgrade policies. And this affected last quarter, and 
will have some effect on the current quarter. This restricted customers who 

sort of stretched the time out to be a hard and fast 

a major factor playing into the North American results.
 
So as I back up and sort of zoom out on this, and look at it, one of the most 
important things for us in the iPhone business was to do really well in 
emerging markets, and we 
had the best quarter ever from that respect. 



eal with 
China Mobile. And so I feel great about that.
 

because of these upgrade policy changes. This affects the period of time, 
three to six months, I would think, and then it washes
 
through. So as I look 
at it, I feel very good about where we are, and I would guess that the 


everyone is sa
ying.

characterized the agreement with China Mobile as huge. Could you tell me 
what would define success for you in China Mobile one and three years out?
 
What ultimately should we be looking at to measure and ultimately 
determine whether this was huge?
 
Tim Cook
 

look at it from a common sense point of view, China Mobile has more 
su
bscribers than anyone in the world. They have three quarters of a billion, 
and so I do see it as a watershed moment for Apple, and have a very strong 
belief in the ability of those two companies to do great things together.

sell through point of view less iPod, because I think all of us have known for 
some time that iPod is a declining business.
 
And when you do that, the numbers from last quarter, and the deferral, 

ust increased, as Peter went through, when you look at that, 
and look at the numbers from last quarter, it comes up to a double digit 

how we do in the March quarter, but I do t

surprise to 
your guidance in the quarter. What were the factors? And then 
looking forward, what are some of the gives and takes for the March 
quarter?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Let me answer that one. Let me start with the quarter. We were above the 
guidance range. It was primaril
y for two factors. We had favorable product 
mix, and we had favorable commodity pricing. And so those were the two 
things that actually helped us come in above the guidance range. For the 


imagine, because of the usual seasonal decline in revenue. But we expect 
that loss of leverage to be largely offset by cost improvements and also by

maturity of the particularly high end smartphone market. I know in our 

 
or 

Western world can show decent unit growth over the next year or two. And I 
was also wondering, the 5C generally is viewed as having turned out to be 
pretty light in the mix. Wh
at are you going to do with that product going 
forward?
 
Tim Cook
 

products. But to your question about the 5S in particular, if I look at the sell 
through year over year, there 
was growth in that portion of the line, despite 


the quarter.
 
And so I do believe that that category 
of product can grow in those markets,

I had a question and a follow up. And Tim, for you, the first one, to follow up 

is going to end up looking up to be 14%. Are you happy with the pricing 
umbrel
la that you currently have? When you originally brought out iPhones, 
in subsequent periods you talked about wanting to push some pricing 
umbrellas. But are you happy with the pricing umbrellas that you have? In 
particular, as you think about the 5C, I thin
k most of the industry views 
have panned the product as not being enough features for that price point. 
But if you could just talk about the positioning of your broader product 
portfolio on iPhones. Are you happy where you are?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think last 
quarter we did a tremendous job, particularly given the mix was 

run that particular play before, and demand percentage turned out to be 
different than we thought. We obviously always
 
look at our results, and 


predict price changes on the earnings call.

Okay. Then my follow up for you Peter is, you mentioned four factors that 
influenced guidance. In particular, you talked about inventory. I think most 
investors would conclude then Dece

had increases in channel inventory. So I was hoping you could peel off a 
little bit and talk about the foreign exchange impact and the higher 
deferrals. Is there a way to quantify that impact on the guidance in Marc
h in 
particular?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
As I had said to one of the early questions, the four factors, we expect to be 
over $2 billion. And the inventory is the largest, and then the other three are 
less than the inventory and not too terribly far apart.

unbelievable numbers. The iPhone is used in 97% of the Fortune 500, and 
91% of the Global 500, and iPad is
 
used in 98% of the Fortune 500 and 93% 
of the Global 500. And we have a number of accounts, some of which Peter 
reviewed in the opening remarks, that have tens of thousands of iOS devices 
working.
 
And also, as I think was mentioned earlier, 90% of tablet 
activations in 
corporations are iPads. And 95% of total app activations were on iOS. And I 

because you can get so much productivity out of an iPad and an iPhone.

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Nancy, and to everyone joining us, welcome. We're proud to 
announce the results of a very successful quar
ter today, setting new March 
quarter records for both revenue and earnings. We generated $61.1 billion 
of revenue. That's up 16% from last year, making it our sixth consecutive 
quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our performance was broad
-
based, 
with i
Phone revenue up 14%, services up 31% and wearables up almost 
50%. We grew in each of our geographic segments, and in Greater China 
and Japan, revenue was up more than 20%.
 
iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half 
with $100
 
billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, 
setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate 
in three years. iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest 
estimates for the global sm
artphone market.
 
And customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the 
March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. 
Since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, this is 
the firs
t cycle in which the top of the line iPhone model has also been the 
most popular.
 
Q2 was our best quarter ever for services and momentum there continues to 
be incredibly strong. Revenue topped $9 billion for the first time, up more 
than $2 billion over las
t year's March quarter. We had all
-
time record 
revenue from the App Store, from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay 
and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our 
huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and e
ngagement of our 
customers.
 
Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 
100 million from a year ago and up $30 million in the last 90 days alone, 
contributing to the overall increase in services revenue. Apple Pay continues 
i
ts strong growth with active users more than doubling and transactions 
tripling year
-
over
-
year.
 
We believe the availability of Apple Pay at major transit systems have been 
a key driver of adoption among commuters and in March, we launched 
Express Transit w
ith Apple Pay in Beijing and Shanghai, the second and third 
largest transit systems in the world. Apple Pay is already the most successful 
mobile transit payment system in Tokyo, which has the busiest transit 
system of all.
 
With the launch of Brazil in Apr
il, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets 
and we expect Norway, Poland and Ukraine to launch in the next several 
months.
 
This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which 
includes Apple Watch, Beats and AirPods with combined revenue
 
of almost 
50% year
-
over
-
year. Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters, our 
wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company.
 
Apple Watch had another great quarter with revenue growing by strong 
double digits year
-
over
-
year to a new M
arch quarter record. Millions of 
customers are using Apple Watch to help them stay active, healthy and 
connected and they have made it the top selling watch in the world.
 
We launched carrier support for Series 3 with cellular in Mainland China, 
Hong Kong a
nd Thailand during the quarter with more markets on the way. 
And now with Watch OS 4.2, there are more features than ever before. For 
example, in addition to tracking your workouts and heart rate, skiers and 
snowboarders can record runs, see vertical desce
nt and calculate speed, as 
well as contribute data directly to the Apple Watch activity app.
 
AirPods are incredibly popular and we're seeing them in more and more 
places, in the gym, in coffee shops, wherever people are enjoying music on 
their Apple device
s. This product is a runaway hit, and we're working hard to 
meet the incredible demand.
 
We started shipping HomePod in February, and it's widely recognized as 
having the best audio quality for its size and class. HomePod is a 
breakthrough speaker that deli
vers amazing sound, and we believe it will 
change the way people listen to music at home. It's currently available in the 
United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and we're looking forward 
to adding new features to HomePod and introducing it to mor
e markets 
around the world soon.
 
In March, we announced new products for the education community, 
including updating our most popular iPad with support for Apple Pencil. It 
empowers students to be even more creative and productive, from learning 
to code to
 
sketching ideas and jotting down handwritten notes to marking up 
screenshots.
 
And the new iPad's gorgeous retina display, advanced chip and enhanced 
cameras and sensors are designed to support the next generation of apps 
for immersive augmented reality ex
periences in the classroom.
 
In addition to our successful Everyone Can Code initiative, we've launched 
Everyone Can Create. It's a new free curriculum that makes it fun and easy 
for teachers to integrate drawing, music, film making or photography into 
thei
r existing lesson plans for any subject.
 
We believe education is the great equalizer. And whether it's through our 
coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform, or the creativity 
both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach 
new 
frontiers of learning with Apple technology.
 
In March, we also released iOS 11.3, a major update offering new immersive 
augmented reality experiences, access to personal health records in the 
Health app and more. Apps can now deliver AR experiences tha
t use vertical 
walls and doors in addition to tables and chairs and can make 

 
more 
accurately map irregular shaped surfaces. The update to ARKit that made 
this possible came just six months after we launched the world's largest AR 
platform.
 
Also in iOS 11
.3, patients in nearly 40 health systems representing hundreds 
of hospitals and clinics can now consolidate their medical records from 
multiple sources and view them all in one place, right from their iPhone. This 
data is encrypted and protected with the u
ser's iPhone passcode, and it can 
help them better understand their health history, have informed 
conversations with doctors and family members, and make future health 
care decisions.
 
Consistent with our long
-
term focus, privacy is a key element of these 
i
nitiatives for education and personal health. We're relentless about making 
the best products and experiences in the world, while fiercely protecting our 
users' privacy, because we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.
 
Our environmental initiatives
 
recently passed an important milestone. All of 
our global facilities across 43 countries are now powered with 100% clean 
energy. We work with communities around the world to build clean power 
sources. Apple now has 25 renewable energy projects operational
 
and 15 
more under construction. We're also driving our supply chain to use clean 
energy. As of last month, 23 of our suppliers are committed to operating on 
100% renewable energy.
 
We're now halfway through our fiscal 2018 with nearly $150 billion in 
revenue and double digit growth in all of our geographic segments. We 
generated almost $34 billion in earnings in six months, and we're very 
bullish on Apple's future. We have the best pipeline of products and services 
we've ever had. We have a huge instal
led base of active devices that is 
growing across all products, and we have the highest customer loyalty and 
satisfaction in the industry.
 
Our services business is growing dramatically. Our balance sheet and our 
cash flow generation are strong and that all
ows us to invest significantly in 
our product roadmap and still return a very meaningful amount of capital to 
our shareholders.
 
Recent corporate tax reform enables us to deploy our global cash more 
efficiently. In the United States, we expect our direct in
vestment in the 
economy to exceed $350 billion over the next five years, including $30 
billion in capital expenditures. And we expect to create over 20,000 U.S. 
jobs at Apple over that timeframe. We're narrowing the site selection for a 
new U.S. campus, an
d we look forward to sharing more information on that 
later this year.
 
Consistent with our annual cadence, today we're providing an update on our 
capital return program. Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our 
program more efficiently, both thro
ugh share repurchases and payment of 
dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either 
directly or indirectly from large pension funds to individuals with retirement 
accounts.
 
So today, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, 
we're announcing a 
significant update to our capital return program. Our Board of Directors has 
approved a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization as well as a 
16% increase in our quarterly dividend, effective with our next dividend 
payable later t
his month. Luca will provide more details about our program 
as well as a more in
-
depth discussion of the quarter's results.
 
So I'll now turn the call over to him. Luca?
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased 
to report 
record financial results for our March quarter with revenue growth of 16%, 
EPS up 30%. Starting with revenue, we generated $61.1 billion, our highest 
ever for a March quarter. Revenue grew in all of our geographic segments, 
setting new Q2 records
 
in most countries we track. Performance was very 
strong in emerging markets where revenue was up 20% and we were 
especially pleased to see 21% year
-
over
-
year growth in Greater China, our 
strongest growth rate from that segment in 10 quarters. We also set 
Q2 
revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in Japan.
 
Gross margin was 38.3%, essentially flat sequentially, as we offset the 
seasonal loss of leverage with cost improvements and a shift in mix toward 
services. Operating margin was 26% of revenue. Ne
t income was $13.8 
billion, up $2.8 billion over last year and a March quarter record. Diluted 
earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to a new record for Q2, and cash 
flow from operations was very strong at $15.1 billion. iPhone revenue grew 
14% year
-
over
-
y
ear, with iPhone ASP increasing to $728 from $655 a year 
ago, driven primarily by the performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 
Plus.
 
During the quarter we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and 
we grew iPhone units by double digits in s
everal markets including Japan, 
Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico and 
Vietnam. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even 
stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory 
by 1.8 millio
n units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction 
last year. We exited the March quarter within our target range of five to 
seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
 
Our customers are extremely happy with their iPhones. The latest survey of 
U.S. 
consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, 
the customer satisfaction rating was 95%, and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus 
and iPhone X, customer satisfaction was even higher, at 99%. And among 
business buyers who plan to purchase smartp
hones in the June quarter, 
78% plan to purchase iPhones.
 
Turning to services. We had a sensational quarter with all
-
time record 
revenue of $9.2 billion, and that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an 
increase of 31% and double the services revenue w
e generated in the March 
quarter just four years ago. Our services business is growing at a very fast 
pace all around the world, with revenue up more than 25% year
-
over
-
year 
in each of our five geographic segments.
 
The App Store set a new all
-
time revenue 
record in the March quarter and 
Apple Music reached a new record for both revenue and paid subscribers, 
which have now passed 40 million. iCloud storage revenue was up by over 
50% year
-
over
-
year to a new all
-
time record, and AppleCare revenue grew 
at its h
ighest rate in five quarters, setting a new March quarter record.
 
Our other product category also set a new record for the March quarter with 
revenue of almost $4 billion. We began shipping HomePod in February and 
unit sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods
 
reached a new high for the March 
quarter. When we combine all our wearables and home products, they 
accounted for over 90% of the total growth in the other products category.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac which set a new March quarter revenue 
recor
d including new records in both the Americas and Greater China. We 
sold 4.1 million Macs, generating year
-
over
-
year growth in many emerging 
markets including Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Central and 
Eastern Europe and India. We were happy to 
see double digit growth in our 
active installed base of Macs to a new all
-
time high, with almost 60% of 
March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac.
 
iPad grew both units and revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. We 
sold 9.1 milli
on iPads and about half of purchases were by customers new to 
iPad. Growth was particularly strong in Japan, in Latin America, Middle East 
and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. All markets where iPad sales 
were up double digits compared to a year ago.
 
We gained share of the global 
tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC and our active 
installed base of iPads reached an all
-
time high.
 
NPD indicates that iPad has 53% of the U.S. tablet market in the March 
quarter, up from 40% share a year ag
o. And the most recent customer 
survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 
95% and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the 
June quarter, 73% plan to purchase iPads.
 
We continue to make great strides in the 
enterprise market. In February, we 
announced a new cyber risk management solution for businesses with Cisco, 
Aon and Allianz. This combined approach is an industry first that integrates 
the most secure technology from Apple and Cisco, cyber resilience 
eval
uation services from Aon and options for enhanced cyber insurance 
coverage from Allianz. Organizations will now be able to better manage and 
protect themselves from cyber risks associated with ransomware and other 
malware
-
related threats. We are thrilled t
hat insurance industry leaders 
recognize that Apple products provide superior security.
 
In March, we announced two new services with IBM to bring more dynamic 
and intelligent insights into apps. IBM Watson services for Core ML and IBM 
Cloud Developer Conso
le for Apple will enable developers to more easily 
build native iOS apps that bring together machine learning with artificial 
intelligence and cloud services.
 
In healthcare, iPhones are being used across leading health systems 
including Cedars
-
Sinai, the M
ayo Clinic and HCA Healthcare with iOS apps to 
support clinical workflows, communications and care delivery. In fact, HCA 
Healthcare recently announced they plan to deploy 100,000 iPhones across 
their hospital sites within the next three years.
 
We had grea
t performance from our retail and online stores which produced 
their highest March quarter revenue ever. Year
-
over
-
year growth was led by 
iPhone as well as strong performance from AirPods and introduction of 
HomePod. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of 
our very popular Today 
at Apple sessions with a particular emphasis on coding and app design.
 
During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in 
Austria, our first in both countries, and three weeks ago we opened our 
newest store in T
okyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today.
 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $267.2 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, and we had $110 billion in term 
debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding 
for a net cash position 
of $145 billion. We returned nearly $27 billion to investors during the 
quarter. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $23.5 
billion on repurchases of 137 million Apple shares through open market 
transactions. 
We also retired 5.7 million shares upon the completion of our 
13 ASR during the quarter.
 
We have now completed over $275 billion of our current $300 billion capital 
return program, including $200 billion in share repurchases against our 
cumulative $210 mil
lion buyback program. We will complete the $210 billion 
program during the June quarter, three full quarters sooner than initially 
planned.
 
The biggest priorities for our cash have not changed over the years. We 
want to maintain the cash we need to fund ou
r day
-
to
-
day operations, to 
invest in our future, and to provide flexibility so that we can respond 
effectively to the strategic opportunities we encounter along the way. As we 
said 90 days ago, the new tax legislation enacted in December gives us 
increase
d financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global 
cash. It allows us to invest for growth in the United States more efficiently 
and it also provides us the opportunity to work towards a more optimal 
capital structure. As we said in Febr
uary, our goal is to become 
approximately net cash neutral over time.
 
Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in 
our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase 
program which we will start executing d
uring the June quarter. Considering 
the unprecedented size of this new authorization, we want to be particularly 
thoughtful and flexible in our approach to repurchasing shares. Our intention 
is to execute our program efficiently and at a fast pace. As in t
he past, we 
will provide regular updates on our capital return activities at the end of 
every quarter.
 
We're also raising our dividend for the sixth time in less than six years. As 
we know, it is very important for our investors who value income. The 
quart
erly dividend will grow from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, an increase of 
16%. This is effective with our next dividend which the board has declared 
today, payable on May 17, 2018, to shareholders of record as of May 14, 
2018.
 
With over $13 billion in annual d
ividend payments, we are proud to be 
among the largest dividend payers in the world and we continue to plan for 
annual dividend increases going forward. We will continue to review our 
capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our busin
ess, 
our investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We will also 
continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. 
This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the 
mix and the pace of our pro
gram. We expect to provide a new update to our 
capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from now.
 
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which 
includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred to at 
the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and 
$53.5 billion. We expect g
ross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We 
expect OpEx to be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. We expect OI&E to 
be about $400 million. And we expect our tax rate to be about 14.5%.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
 
Sha
nnon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about your thoughts on sort of 
iPhone and positioning now that we're a couple of quarters out from the 
launch of the iPhone X. Given the $1,000 price point, and it's clearly selling 
bu
t there's been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that 
price point and how you're thinking about it as you look out sort of 
holistically across your lineup. So if you could talk a bit about what you're 
hearing from your customers and 
then I have a follow up. Thank you.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Sure. Shannon, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 
14% year
-
over
-
year on iPhone and that's a combination of single digit unit 
growth and ASP growth that is mainly dr
iven by iPhone X. I think that our 
iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market 
that is as large as a smartphone market and so we're going to continue to 
provide different iPhones for folks to meet their needs.
 
On iPhone X sp
ecifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again 
one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, that customers 
chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the 
March quarter, just as they did following its launch in th
e December quarter.
 
Also, since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 
2014, this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line 
iPhone model has also been the most popular. And so with the customer set 
that Luca
 
referenced as well, the 99%, the iPhone X is a beloved product. 
And so I think that it's one of those things where like a team wins the Super 
Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points but it's a Super 
Bowl winner and that's how we feel about i
t. I could not be prouder of the 
product.
 
Shannon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
Okay. Thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit about working capital, 
specifically inventory which went up pretty significantly quarter
-
over
-
quarter? What's driving that a
nd how are you thinking about, I mean, it's 
one of the uses of cash obviously, so how are you thinking about inventory 
and maybe working capital in general as you're going forward?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, Shannon, you know that we've always genera
ted significant amount of 
cash through working capital. We've got a negative cash conversion cycle 
and we plan to continue to have that. Our inventory level has gone up. It's 
just a temporary event. We have decided to make some purchasing decision, 
given c
urrent market conditions, and that should unwind over time.
 
Shannon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
So that was essentially component purchases?
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Correct.

Thank you. Good afternoon. The services growth acceleration is really the 
highlight this quarter in my mind. Can you talk about what the biggest 
drivers, whether it be products or regions that drove the acceleration and do 
you think that we can continue to
 
see growth north of 30%? And then I have 
a follow
-
up.
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
Hi, Katy. It's Tim. The services grew 31%. We hit an all
-
time record at $9.2 
billion, first time we cleared $9 billion. The great news about it is, it's not a 
single g
eo or a single service. If you look at it, each of the geos, the 
minimum was at 25%. So each of the geos did extremely well and we set 
records from the App Store to the Apple Music to iCloud to Apple Pay and 
more. And underneath that, if you look at the su
bscriptions, the number of 
subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions 
had moved up over 100 million on a year
-
over
-
year basis to over 270 million 
by the end of the quarter.
 
And so it's very broad
-
based in terms of type of se
rvice and geographic 
region. It's sort of exactly what we would like to see. In terms of forecasting 
moving forward, we've obviously made assumption for our guidance that 
Luca provided earlier and in terms of longer term, we're on target to our 
2020 goal o
f doubling the services revenue of 2016 as we had talked about 
previously.

And it doesn't look like the threat of a trade war with China slowed down 
that business. In fact, growth accelerated. But anything an
ecdotally that you 
see in the business in recent weeks that would suggest that that is having an 
impact on demand and any actions that Apple is taking as a company to 
preempt any risk of tariffs going forward?
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, I thin
k my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable 
mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if 
China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win. And so I think 
there's lots of things that bind the coun
tries together and I'm actually very 
optimistic. I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness 
and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed.
 
And so I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and 
grow
 
the pie, not just allocate it differently. And so that's our focus, and I'm 
optimistic that 

 
I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over 
time, I think that view will prevail.

Hey. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Just following 
on the services question, I'd be curious what the next dri
vers of services 
revenue are. Will it be continued penetration of Music and Pay that you see 
as kind of the largest future categories of incremental growth? Or maybe 
when could augmented reality become a material part of services? And then 
I have a follow 
up.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Well, Mike, it's Tim. Again, the great thing about services is there are several 
services that make up the total that are growing nicely.
 
And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base is 
at 
such a level, that last quarter we said that we had exceeded 1.3 billion. 
This year 

 
we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've 
obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double digit number on a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
And so with th
at kind of change in the installed base and with the services 
that we have now and others that we are working on, I think this is just a 
huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.
 
Michael J. Olson 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Okay. 
And then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in 
China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year
-
over
-
year 
growth in 10 quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X 
specifically, or something else that's behin
d that improvement? Thank you.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
It's a good question. iPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of 
China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a 
number like 21% on the growth that you see 
on your data sheet there, there 
has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth 
rates there are the other products category, which is our wearables business 
in China and the services business, which you and I just spoke about.
 
T
he iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number. And 
we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually 
several vectors there that are working well for us.
 
We also 

 
more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the to
p three selling 
phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was number one, but we had several 
in the top.

Thanks a lot. Two questions from me as well. I guess first one, just touching 
on the gross margin dynamics, if I look at the guidance for June on a year
-
over
-
year basis, I think sales are up double digit but gross margin
s are still 
flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you 
just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on a gross margin basis on 
a year
-
over
-
year basis for June?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, Amit, it's Luca. We tend 
to look at our gross margin dynamics on a 
sequential basis, and essentially we're guiding to about flat on a sequential 
basis. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, it's less relevant for our business. But in 
general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more d
ifficult cost 
environment, particularly we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of 
impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through.
 
Amit Daryanani

Got it. And if I could just follow up. Tim, you've bee
n fairly vocal I think 
talking about the need for better privacy protection and well
-
crafted 
regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand, how does 
Apple protect consumer data? And how does this ongoing debate around 
data protection transl
ate into a positive for Apple over time?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
We protect it by encrypting it, and we keep the bulk of information or a 
significant amount of information on the device so that the user is in control 
of it. We also collect much l
ess overall than others do. Because if you look at 
our model, if we can convince you to buy an iPhone or an iPad, we'll make a 
little bit of money. You're not our product. And so that's how we look at that.
 
In terms of benefit, we don't really view it like
 
that. We view that privacy is 
a fundamental human right and that it's an extremely complex situation if 
you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth. And 
we've always viewed that part of our role was to sort of make things as 
simp
le as possible for the user and provide them a level of privacy and 
security. And so that's how we look at it.

Great. Thank you. Luca, could you talk a bit more about the capital 
allocation? The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what 
you could have done, so are you really thinking the stock price is attractive 
here? 
And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace. Can you 
give us any timeframe of that $100 billion and how much debt do you think 
about in terms of net cash zero?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yes. Let's start with the dividend. We're increasing it
 
by 16%. This is the 
largest increase that we've done since we've reintroduced the dividend back 
in August of 2012. So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the 
investors that value income. Obviously, when we come down to capital 
allocation deci
sions, we obviously also keep in mind that the opportunity for 
us to do some M&A activities which we do in an ongoing basis.
 
But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that 
for a variety of reasons we see a lot of value in the stock.
 
We believe the 
stock is undervalued and so we have a bias towards the buyback. So the 
dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to 
be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends but 
we believe that 
given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think 
that we continue to do the buyback primarily.
 
We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount 
is very, very large and so we will try to execute it. As you've seen from o
ur 
track record during the last five years, we will do it at a very fast pace but 
we also want to do it efficiently. We want to make sure that we buy back the 
stock at the right time. And so with that in mind, we have done $23.5 billion 
of repurchases duri
ng the March quarter. We will give you an update to our 
activities at the end of every quarter and then 12 months from now we will 
actually talk about an update to the entire program. So you will be able to 
keep track of our progress every 90 days.

Thank you. And, Tim, could you talk a bit about your healthcare 
opportunity? Is it merely selling watches over time or do you think more 
broadly about it? Is there a services play? You're doing some things for your 
employees
. Could that potentially broaden out? How do you think about the 
opportunity there?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
We think about it very broadly and you can tell that a bit by some of the 
things that we've had going with ResearchKit and CareKit and 
most recently 
the health records that I had referenced in my initial comments and those all 
came out of getting significantly engaged in the Apple Watch and sort of 
pulling the strings, so to speak. And we also have a heart study that is going 
on currently
, and so I don't want to give too much away. But it's an area of 
great interest where we think we can make a big difference in. And so it's a 
major strategic thrust of ours.

Yes, Tim, I think there is China numbers are actually phenomenal in the 
quarter and third consecutive quarter of growth. I think there's been a 
lot of 
concerns just Apple in China and maybe misinformation out there. But what 
do you see as the drivers for Apple in both Mainland China and Greater 
China over the next few years? And also if you could just give us an update 
on what you're seeing in Ind
ia.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, good question. Let me start with India, and then I'll talk more about 
China. India, we set a new first
-
half record. So we continue to put great 
energy there and try to 

 
our objective over time is to go in there 
with all of 
our different initiatives from retail and everything else. And so we're working 
toward those things. It's a huge market and it's clear that many people will 
be moving into the middle class over time, as we've seen in other countries.
 
China, I c
ontinue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity 
from a market point of view, but also lots of opportunity from a app 
developer point of view. We have almost 2 million application developers in 
China that are writing apps for iOS and the
 
App Store, and they're doing 
unbelievably creative work and innovative work. So we look at China 
holistically, not only as a market.
 
On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as 
being the top selling smartphone during the quarter
. We gained share during 
the quarter. I read some notes here and there about the market itself not 
being good. I think on any kind of, on a 90
-
day clock, lots of different things 
can happen. But my own personal view of China is that it's a great market, 
an
d we are certainly looking far beyond 90 days and feel very bullish on the 
opportunity and the environment there.
 
I would say that the market for us is more than iPhone. The Mac gained 
share there as well. The Watch is getting some traction there. Services
 
is 
doing extremely well. And so it has several catalysts and I'm very pleased 
with the results that we were able to show during the quarter.

Wamsi Mohan

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim, can you comment on the price elasticity of 
demand at the high e
nd for iPhones, if that was in line with your 
expectations? Do you have a preference for unit growth versus ASP growth 
when it comes to maximizing that gross profit dollar growth? And I have a 
follow
-
up for Luca, please.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
W
e price for the value that we're delivering, and iPhone X is the most 
innovative product on the market. And I've said a few times, we have there 
sort of jam
-
packed with technologies that really set up the smartphone for 
the next decade. And so that's how w
e priced it.
 
We were surprised somewhat that through all of this period of time that the 
iPhone X winds up at the most selling, most popular for every week of the 
time since the launch. And so that's I think a powerful point. And it's number 
one in China, 
which is another powerful point. And so obviously at some 
point if those technologies move to lower price points and that there's 
probably more unit demand. But the way we think about it is trying to price 
a reasonable price for the value that we deliver a
nd I feel that we did that.
 
Wamsi Mohan 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you, Tim. And, Luca, your gross margins have been very robust 
despite the headwinds that you absorbed on commodities, which you 
quantified, and frankly, also from the FX hedges t
hat are limiting somewhat 
the FX upside that a lot of other companies are seeing. So as you, one, 
when do you expect these to turn into tailwinds? And when they do turn into 
tailwinds, would you consider reinvesting some of those into pricing or 
should we 
think about you flowing those through to the bottom line?
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Well, Wamsi, I think, let me start with where we are right now. I think 
you're right. I think we've been able to navigate a difficult foreign exchange 
environment for a nu
mber of years and now, as you know, because we have 
this hedging program as the dollar has weakened a bit in recent months, 
although during the last week it's actually started to turn the other way 
again, we've got the hedging program that works both ways.
 
And also on 
the memory front, we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the 
corner very soon. For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, 
possibly at the end of this year. And so that should provide some level of 
stability.
 
As I said earlier
 
this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult 
cost environment and so hopefully that can turn into a positive for us. At the 
same time, it's very difficult for me to give you an indication of what is going 
to happen in the future becaus
e every product cycle is different, and as you 
know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. There are some 
elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over 
the course of the cycle.
 
For example, our cost structures that we
 
are able to manage throughout the 
year. But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like 
foreign exchange. And the mix of products and services that we sell to our 
customers also has an impact on the overall gross margin.
 
Our prima
ry consideration is always around maximizing gross margin 
dollars, and that is the approach that we take around for example pricing 
decisions.

From Citi, 
we'll hear from Jim Suva.
 
Jim Suva

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. And I'll ask actually both my questions at the same 
time, one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, strategically when we talk to 
investors they often say, oh, iPhone market 
is saturated. There's not much 
room for growth. Yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging 
markets like India and all those still are growth.
 
When you think about India and those markets, do you kind of believe that 
some of those markets co
uld get to much higher or a more normalized 
market share that you have in some of the developing countries over time? 
And can you talk a little bit about some of those efforts you may be doing?
 
And then, Luca, on the question for you, is about the gross ma
rgin. When 
we think about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple 
services have been so successful and accretive to margins, should we start 
to look for some potential margin, gross margin upside, again should 
components stabilize? Thank y
ou, gentlemen.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, Jim, thanks for the question. In terms of the 

 
let me address the 
smartphone market a bit and then I'll mention iPhone.
 
In terms of the market in general, if you look at last year, which is the last 
d
ata point we have on the full market, there were still 0.5 billion feature 
phones sold in the world. And so many of those were sold into emerging 
markets, not all of them, but many of them. And we still believe that over 
time every phone sold will be a sma
rtphone. And so it seems to us that with 
that many feature phones being sold, that's a pretty big opportunity.
 
In terms of the iPhone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across 
the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to t
he 

 
our 
sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones. And so our task is 
to convince people that currently 

 
or have another type of phone to switch, 
while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose 

 
when they elect 
to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone. And so 
we've spent quite a bit of time on that, as you might guess.
 
I do think that India, India is the third largest smartphone market in the 
world. There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and
 
we have 
extremely low share in that market overall. And so we're putting a lot of 
energy there and working with the carriers in that market, and they're 
investing enormously on the LTE networks. And the infrastructure has come 
quite a ways since we began 
to put a lot of energy in there because of their 
leadership and so forth.
 
And so I do think 

 
I don't buy the view that market's saturated. I don't see 
that from a market point of view or 

 
and certainly not from an iPhone point 
of view. I think the smartp
hone market is sort of like the best market for a 
consumer product company in the history of the world and 

 
but that's how I 
feel about it. It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Jim, on the gross margi
n side, I think I'll repeat what I said earlier, but 
you're right. Our services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive 
to company margins. And so as we are able to grow the services business, 
that should provide a positive, a tailwind. At the
 
same time, within the 
services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels 
of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that 
we're going to be selling.
 
At a macro level, because about two
-
thirds of our
 
company is outside the 
United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins; a strong 
dollar, as it's been during the last four years, has been a bit of a headwind 
for the company. We try to make it more stable through the hedging 
program.
 
And
 
in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, 
typically when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher 
cost structure than the product it replaces. And so that is something that we 
need to work through every time we 
launch a new product and we have a 
pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down 
over time. So we need to balance all these different elements.
 
I think we've done a pretty remarkable job during the last several years at 
managing
 
all these different variables and coming out with a level of gross 
margins that we think is really good for investors and certainly it is our plan 
to continue to manage them that way. But it's very difficult for me to give 
you a prediction of where gross 
margins are going to be six months or 12 
months from now.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter 

recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to 
turn the call 
over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. 

 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. 
Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and Vice President and 
Corporate Control
ler, Luca Maestri, and they will be joined by CFO, Peter 
Oppenheimer for the Q&A session with the analysts.
 

today will consists of forward
-
looking statements, including without 
limi
tation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, 
other income and expense, stock
-
based compensation expense, taxes, 
future products and capital allocation plans.
 
Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For mor
e 

-
K 
for 2013, the Form 10
-
Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, and the Form 8
-
K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple 
assumes no obligation to 
update any forward
-
looking statements or 
information, which speak as of their respective dates.
 

 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to share with you 
ove


 
We generated $45.6 billion in revenue, which was ahead of our expectations 
and represents a new March quarter record, and is our strongest
 
non
-
holiday 
quarter ever. Our underlying business performance was even stronger than 
our reported results imply. When you take into account changes in channel 
inventory this year versus last year and foreign exchange had wins that we 
faced in several of o
ur international markets. Setting foreign exchange and 
inventory changes aside, our underlying growth rate would have been close 
to double digits.
 
These strong revenue results combined with our best gross margin 
percentage since September of 2012 resulted 
in earnings per share growth 
of 15%, which is our highest earnings growth rate in the last six quarters. 
iPhone was key in driving our stronger
-
than
-
expected results. We sold 
almost 44 million iPhones, setting a new March quarter record. These 
stronger res
ults were broad
-
based both from a product point of view with 
demand for each of our three iPhone stronger than its predecessor and from 
a geographic standpoint.
 
We gained smartphone share in many developed and emerging markets 
including the U.S., the UK, J
apan, Canada, Germany, France, Vietnam and 
Greater China, just to mention a few. In fact, we established a new all
-
time 
record for total iPhone sales in the BRIC countries.
 
iTunes software and services revenue continue to grow at a double
-
digit 
rate, thank
s to an incredible ecosystem and our very large, loyal and 
engaged customer base. With its strong momentum in growing profitability, 
iTunes is a very important driver of our business not only here in the United 
States, but around the world. We now have an 
almost 800 million iTunes 
accounts, most of these with credit cards. This is a staggering number.
 
We continue to gain share in the personal computer market as well. We 
defied industry trends again by growing while the market contracted. Our 
bold decision t
o make OS X free has resulted in the largest ever percentage 
of the Mac installed base running on the latest version of the operating 
system just months after its release.
 
iPad sales came in at the high end of our expectations, but we realized they 
were be
low analyst estimates, and I would like to proactively address, why 
we think there was a difference. We believe almost all of the difference can 
be explained by two factors. First, in the March quarter last year, we 
significantly increased iPad channel inv
entory, while this year we 
significantly reduced it. Luca will go into more detail about this later.
 
Second, we ended the December quarter last year with a substantial backlog 
with iPad mini that was subsequently shipped in the March quarter, whereas 
we en
ded the December quarter this year near supply demand balance. We 
continue to believe that the tablet market will surpass the PC market in size 
within the next few years and we believe that Apple will be a major 
beneficiary of this trend.
 
When we look at o

especially proud of our very strong results in Greater China, where we 
established an all time quarterly revenue record of almost $10 billion 
including the results from our retail stores. And in Japan, wh
ere revenue was 
up 26% in spite of the foreign exchange headwinds and where our 
smartphone market share reached an incredible 55%.
 
We are continuing to invest in our retail stores and since our last call, we 
had opened our first stores in Brazil and Turkey
 
and we now have retail 

our new retail and online leader, Angela Ahrendts, who will be joining 

the halfway mar
k for fiscal 2014.
 
Our strong March quarter results bring us to total revenues of over $103 
billion for the first six months of the year and earnings per share growth 
close to double
-

added over $60 m
illion new registered users of our four product categories. 
Additionally, over two
-

months, were new to iPad, while over half of the people registering iPhones 
were new to iPhone.
 
It is wonderful to add 
tens of millions of first time Apple product users, 

in our history. Customers who have a great experience with their first Apple 
products, often become loyal and happy owners of 
the multiple Apple 
products overtime.
 

possible through their creativity and passion they bring to their work 

r 
their loyalty and enthusiasm and for continually inspiring us to surprise and 
delight them.
 
In addition to our quarterly results, we are also announcing an update to our 

guiding
 
principles for capital allocation and our conclusion on the changes we 
are making for this year. Apple has created tremendous value for 

will always be our top priority and drivi
ng force.
 


investing in our supply chains promote scale and efficiencies, expanding our 
global presence by b
uilding retail stores, investing in marketing and 
distribution and extending our reach into new markets.
 

are not going to under invest in this business. We are also investing through
 

invest organically and to make acquisition strategically, we need to maintain 

management team, will do capital all
ocation regularly and we solicit input on 
our program from a broad base of shareholders.
 
We very much appreciate all of the input that so many of our shareholders 

seek investor input g

around this time each year.
 
This regular process allows us to continually evaluate return of capital in 
light of the most current information available and it enables us to be 
thoughtful about the size, 
mix and pace of the program. We continue to be 
in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to 
shareholders. We started doing so two years ago when we announced our 
first program of $45 billion and we more than doubled the program 
last April 
to $100 billion.
 
Today, we are announcing that we are increasing the size of our program 
once again with an addition of over $30 billion for a total program size of 
over $130 billion. The size and pace of our program is unprecedented and 
we stil
l expect to complete it by December of 2015 as we announced last 
year.
 
We think very deliberately about how much and in which way to return cash 
to our shareholders. We decided to continue to allocate the vast majority of 
the incremental capital return to 
share repurchases because we believe our 
current stock price does not reflect the full value of the company. The size of 
the share back increases the signal of the Board and the management 

 
We also 
understand the importance of the dividend to many of our investors 
and we are increasing it for the second time in less than two years. We 
believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value 
income and we are planning for annual dividend
 
increases going forward.
 
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Luca for the details of our quarterly 
results as well as more information about our capital return program.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you Tim and good afternoon everyone. As Tim said revenue for
 
the 
March quarter was $45.6 billion, up $2 billion or 5% from a year ago and 
above our guidance range. Sales in each of our major product categories 
were at the high end of our expectations or better and the vast majority of 
the revenue upside came from s
trong sales of iPhone.
 
Gross margin was 39.3%, also above our guidance range and operating 
margin was $15.6 billion, representing 29.8% of revenue. Net income was 
$10.2 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $11.62.
 

d like to start with iPhone. We sold 43.7 million 

iPhones over last year that represents 17% growth. The addition of China 
Mobile coupled with great response to our more affordably
 
priced iPhone 4S 
led to an all time quarterly record for iPhone sales in Greater China. We look 
forward to broadening our relationship with China Mobile as they expand 
points of sale and continue to build out their 4G network.
 
In Japan, iPhone sales were 
up over 50% year
-
over
-
year resulting in 

share gains in many other major developed markets based on IDCs latest 
estimates for the March quarter.
 
iPhone also continued to perform ex
ceptionally well in many developing 
markets. In Greater China, Brazil, Indonesia, Poland and Turkey. iPhone 
sales grew by strong double
-
digits year
-
over
-
year, and in India and Vietnam 
sales more than doubled.
 
We exited the quarter with 15.4 million total i
Phones in channel inventory, 
which represents a sequential increase of about 100,000 from the December 
quarter and left us within our target range of four to six weeks.
 
In the enterprise market progressive organizations are leading the charge to 
replace le
gacy devices and systems, and are using iPhone and iOS to drive 
innovation at their companies. Deutsche Bank has nearly 20,000 iPhones 
running on its network and has created 40 internal apps that extend the 
capabilities of its mobile workforce.
 
Siemens hav
e 30,000 iPhones on its network and has deployed over 50 
internal apps for field service teams, sales associates and corporate 
executives for solution that are only possible with iOS and iPhone. We are 
really happy with the continued growth and strength of
 
the Apple 
ecosystem.
 
Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.6 billion, an 
increase of 11% year
-
over
-
year at an all time quarterly record. Our iTunes 
stores generated record billings of $5.2 billion in the March quarter, up 24% 
year
-
over
-
ye
ar driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These 
iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.6 billion, up 
9% from the year ago quarter, and also a new all
-
time record.
 
Software and services revenue was over $1.9 billion, up 
14% from a year 
ago. App Store momentum is incredibly strong as cumulative app downloads 
at 70 billion, 87% of iOS devices are now running iOS 7 and our highly 
engaged users are a great audience for developers.
 
According to App Annie, the App Store generat
ed 85% more global revenue 
than Google Play in the March quarter despite the differences in unit market 
share between iOS and Android devices.
 

just under 4 million in the year ago qua
rter. Thanks to strong performance 
from MacBook Pro and MacBook Air and Macs have now gained global 
market share for 31 of the last 32 quarters. Response to Mavericks has been 
great, and we are very proud of the fact that so many of our Mac customers 
are t
aking advantage of the most advanced and secured experience 
possible. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below 
our four to five week target range.
 
Turning to iPad, we saw 16.4 million units. As Tim explained earlier, our iPad 
results 
and the comparison to the March quarter last year were heavily 
influenced by channel inventory changes. Specifically, this year we saw 16.4 
million iPads into our channels and sold through almost 17.5 million reducing 
our channel inventory by 1.1 million u
nits.
 
Last year we sold over 19.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through 
18 million and therefore increased channel inventory by 1.4 million units. As 
a result, the year
-
over
-

the sell in decline o

iPad channel inventory, which left us within our target range of four to six 
weeks.
 
iPad continues to lead all other tablets by far in terms of user engagement,

reimagine the way they use technology to dri

an industry where efficiency is critical FedEx pilots and maintenance crews 
around the world use iPad to transform operational processes and save the

Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $150.6 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $8.3 billion. 
Our domestic cash was $18.4 billion at the end of the March quarter, a 
sequential decline of $16 b
illion and $132.2 billion or 88% of our total cash 
was offshore. Cash flow from operations was very strong at $13.5 billion for 
the quarter.
 
In total, we executed almost $21 billion worth of capital return activities 
during the March quarter. First, we lau
nched our third accelerated share 
repurchase program in late January through which we will acquire an 
additional $12 billion of Apple stock. We received an initial delivery of 19.2 
million shares under this ASR and we received a balance of shares due when 
the program concludes by December of this year.
 
Second, we paid $2.7 billion in dividends in February. And finally, we spent 
$6 billion on open market purchases of 11.4 million shares throughout the 
March quarter. At the end of March, we also settled our s
econd ASR 
program, which was launched in April of last year, resulting in the retirement 
of an additional 1.1 million shares.
 
I would like now to go into more detail about the expansion of our capital 

t by summarizing 


current $60 billion share repurchase authorization, over 75% of the program 
with seven quarters r
emaining to its completion.
 
We have acted aggressively and opportunistically and have delivered on our 
intention to return capital to shareholders at a fast pace. Including dividends 
and net
-
share
-

0 
billion program announced last year.
 

program from $100 billion to over $130 billion within the same timeframe of 
December 2015 as before. There are two elements to the expansio
n of the 


future, and we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value 

 
why the vast majority of our capital program 
continues to be allocated to share repurchases. We will also continue to net
-
share
-
settle, restricted stock units and expect to utilize about $1 billion of 
cash annually for that purpose.
 
Second, our Board has 
declared a dividend of $3.29 per common share 
payable on May 15, 2014 to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2014. That 
represents an increase of about 8% in our quarterly dividend. We 
understand the importance of dividend increases to many of our investo
rs, 


Apple is one of the largest dividend payers in the world, with annual 
payments of $11 billion.
 
All 
our capital return activities must be funded by domestic cash which as I 
mentioned was about $18 billion as we exited the March quarter, and down 
from $39 billion in the quarter that we paid our first dividend. We would 
maintain sufficient domestic liquidi
ty to grow the business and execute 

international expansion in recent years. We have built substantial offshore 
cash balances to repatriate our fall in cash on the current U.S. tax l
aw, we 

be in the best interest of our shareholders.
 
We continue to advocate for comprehensive corporate tax reform and 
streamlining the tax code which we believe would be of great
 
benefit to the 
U.S. economy. To execute our updated capital return program in a tax 
efficient manner and leverage our very strong balance sheet, we intend to 
access the debt markets again. We plan to be active in both the domestic 
and international bond m
arkets during 2014 for an amount of term debt 
financing similar to what we issued in 2015, with a break down between 
markets currencies and tenures to be determined over the course of the 
year and subject to prevailing conditions in each market.
 
We have al
so prepared ourselves to access the commercial paper market 
given the substantial short term liquidity and flexibility that this channel can 
provide.
 

which includes the types of fo

looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $36 billion 
and $38 billion compared to $35.3 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect 
gross margins to be between 37% and 38%.
 
We expect OpEx 
to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion. We are

Okay. And then question the around iPhone ASPs, just looking at the trend 
iPhone 5s, demand has surprised to the upside over this cycle. Does that

Bill C. Shope 

 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay, great. Thanks. Can you walk through the key drivers of the 
June 
quarter gross margin guidance off of what was admittedly very sharp upside 
for the March quarter.
 
Luca Maestri
 

were three seasons for it. We had obviously better volume as y

from our revenue results. We had better cost than anticipated, and we had 
some favorable mix of both products and services. As we get into Q3, 

loss of leverage, which would
 
come from the sequential decline in revenue. 

favorable mix. This is something very typical that happens to us as we move 
farther away from the quarter when we launched the new prod
ucts. To offset 
that, it's only going to be a partial offset. We will have some cost 
improvements.
 
Bill C. Shope 

 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Then looking at the iPhone upside for the March quarter, obviously, it looks 
like China was a key driver here, but within
 
the U.S., did you see as much 
pressure from the changes in U.S. carrier upgrade policy that you had 
discussed last quarter, and was demand I guess just strong enough to 
completely counter that? And then is this headwind behind us now, and 
potentially a ta
ilwind in the U.S. as we head into the June quarter?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
We saw some pressure in the quarter because of the stricter enforcement of 
upgrade policies. So this was primarily in the U.S. as I mentioned last time. 
But if you really look at iPhone, 
the strength of iPhone was very broad
-
based 
and as I've mentioned, we gained share in a whole host of markets, from 
developing markets like the U.S., U.K., France, Germany to more of the 
emerging markets like China, Vietnam, and had the largest total sales
 
of 
iPhone in the BRIC countries that we've ever seen in our history. And so we 
feel very good about that the strength was broad
-
based.

Nancy Paxton
 
Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question please.
 
O
perator
 

 
Toni Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Yes. Thank you. Peter best wishes going forward. I have one question for 
Luca and a follow
-
up for Tim please. Luca, on the iPhone ASPs this quarter, 
they we
re down a little over $40. I think that was the largest sequential 
decline that we've seen in history. I was wondering if you could help us 
understand what drove that. Was it entirely mix? You mentioned good 
growth in each of the three models, but were you
 
seeing particularly strong 
growth in the 4s? I think you mentioned that in China. And how significant if 
any was selling older generation for iPhone 4?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, Toni. When you look at the $41 of decline, I would say about half of 
that was driven 
by the fact that we have continued to do very well in 
emerging markets with the 4s. I have mentioned that there is a lot of 
markets where we've grown very strongly in Latin America, in Asia
-
Pacific, in 
Eastern Europe. So, about half of that decline came fr
om the stronger sales 
of the 4s. And then the rest was primarily the fact that, again as we move 
away from the quarter where we launched a product, we tend to have lower 
capacity mix in our numbers.
 
Toni Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Okay. Tim, I was wond
ering if you could talk about how you think about 
replacement cycles generally for the iPhone over the longer term. Clearly 
U.S. carriers have started introducing plans that may ultimately encourage 
people to keep their phone longer than two years, because
 
their total price 
paid is less. And so one could argue and I'd like your opinion on whether you 
think that could push out replacement cycles.
 
I guess, the other consideration is the imperative for Apple to continue to 
introduce really great products to wa
nt to have people upgrade at the same 
frequency. And I guess, the dilemma in doing that is as we've seen with the 
5 and with the 4 is introducing really great products, typically puts pressure 
on your BOM and pressures margin. So perhaps you could just tel
l us how 
you think conceptually about where you think replacement cycles go over 
time and why? And then secondly, how do you address this dilemma of well 
in order to make a great phone it typically costs more to do so and 
managing their potential margin pr
essure.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
There is a lot there, let me see if I can address it quickly and I want to just 
add one thing to the point that you asked Luca. Just to be clear on the 
iPhone 4 question, we sold a very, very low single
-
digit percentage of those 
and
 
so it had extremely minimal impact of results on the quarter. In terms 
of the general upgrade or the installed base, some of the programs that the 
carriers are running may serve to increase the upgrade cycle because there 
are some areas where customers ca
n pay a bit more in the beginning and 
have the ability to essentially upgrade each year.
 
So I think there is some that work that way. I think there is some that work 
the way that more of the way that you're leaning, and how these balanced 
are very difficul
t currently to conclude.
 
But regardless of how those balance, what I see as the bigger opportunity 
for Apple is that the smartphone market is still only 1 billion or so units and 
it will eventually take over the entire mobile phone market. We've seen 
our 
ability to attract new users to iPhone to be very significant in the emerging 
markets. We were seeing new to iPhone numbers on the iPhone 4s sales in 
the 80 percentages in certain large geos. So, this to us give us a great 
comfort that we can continue 
to grow and we may not be able to attract 
some of those buyers to our top phone because of the price point. But if we 
can get them in on the entry iPhone, it gives them a great product, at a 
great value and gets them into the ecosystem.
 
And as you know fro
m following us for a while, our ability to keep customers 
is very good and our ability to show other products that Apple produces to a 
family that's buying Apple product is also very good. And so, at the macro 
level, I see the opportunity of the market and
 
getting more people into the 
Apple ecosystem much larger than any of the noise around the different 
carrier plans, some of which I think helped, and some of which I think 
worked the opposite way and it's completely unclear to me how those net.
 
It's probab
ly also important to know that the bulk of the things you're seeing 
in the U.S. are not occurring in many of the other geos in terms of the 
upgrade policies and so forth. I mean, each country has its own kind of 
cadence associated with this, and the U.S. i
s 

 


 
Toni Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Okay. And any comments on the latter part of that around, sort of the 
imperative to continue to come out with really
 
great products that ensure 


 
Timothy D. Cook
 
The most important thing, Toni, that we do is to make great products that 
re
ally get our users excited to want the next one and that will always be the 

attention is on doing this thing. In terms of the BOM pressure of any new 
product, you have seen in the past
 

we have a way of working down the cost curve. That was certainly very key 
in achieving the 39.3% gross margin from this past quarter. And as I said 
before, we price things at a level that is fair for the value th
at we are 

that values that are fair for the value that we are delivering.

Thank you. Tim, I understand that the iPad is not as weak as it appears on a

comments. When I backup f



markets, from consumer to business including the enterprise 
and education.
 
And so, if you really look at it in just four years after we launched the very 


note that th




ckly.
 
Looking at it by market a bit, which I think is important. I think Luca 
mentioned a little bit of this in his comments. In the education market in the 
U.S., we have a 95% share. And so the focus in education is on penetration, 
is on getting more scho
ols to buy and my belief is the match has been lit, 



on far beyond the U.S. 
now. This is happening in many, many parts of the world.
 


at activations of tablets
, the latest data we have from them is that 91% of 
the activation of tablets in enterprise were iPads. And so this is also an 
astonishing number and many of those enterprises are writing apps that are 
key proprietary apps for running that business, and thi
s is great for that 

again, just like in education in a way, what we have to do in enterprise is 
focus on penetration. It has to be deeper and broader. But in terms of 
having people be

pretty good job of that.
 
In the retail market, if you look at the U.S. as a proxy, the NPD numbers for 
March just came out a few days ago and we had 46% share and embedded 

 




re. Office, I 

have been done earlier, it would have been even better for Microsoft frankly.
 
There is a lots of alternatives out there from a productivity point of view, 
some of whi
ch we brought to the market, some of which many, many 
innovative companies have brought. But I do see that Office is still a very 
key franchise in the enterprise, in particular. And I think having it on iPad is 
good, and I wholeheartedly welcome Microsoft 
to the App Store to sell 

available. So, I do think it helps us particularly in the enterprise area.
 
The other things you look at on iPad that are just blow away as customer sat 
is 98. The
re is almost nothing in the world with a 98% customer sat and the 
intention to buy numbers look good with two
-
thirds of the people planning to 
buy a tablet or planning to buy an iPad. The usage numbers are off the 
chart, far and exceeding Android tablets, 
four times the web traffic of all 
Android tablets combined.
 

every quarter, every 90 days is going to be a number that everybody is 
thrilled with. But what it means to me is that 
the trend over the arc of time 
that things look very, very good, that iPad has a great future. And of course 
the thing that drives us more than any of this are the next iPads if you will, 
the things that are in the pipeline, the things that we can do to ma
ke the 
product even better and there is no shortage of work going in on that nor 
any shortage of ideas.
 

excited about where we are.
 
I think we did a reasonable job of explaining wha
t we think the disconnect 
was between what we had expected, which we hit it at the high end of our 
expectation and the street's view of this one. I believe the vast majority of it 
is that first thing was just channel inventory that maybe we should have 
bee
n even clearer on last quarter to take into account. But I'm very bullish 
on iPad.
 
Steven M. Milunovich 

 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay, very complete thank you. One other question, when you look at 
Google and Amazon and Facebook, they've very much diversified t
heir 
business over time in a way that one has rarely seen. Apple, sort of the 
opposite. People say you ought to buy this or that and you'll do acquisitions, 
but you're obviously very focused. Is that because it's just a management 
philosophy of wanting to 
be more focused than some of these other 
companies? Or is there something about Apple's products that particularly 
being more hardware oriented that kind of prevents you from saying, yes, 
let's go make TV shows or let's go often do something else, even tho
ugh you 
probably have the money and the technical capability to do all these things?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
The key thing for us, Steve, is to stay focused on things that we can do best 
and that we can perform at a really high
-
level of quality that our 
customers 
have come to expect. And so we currently feel comfortable in expanding the 
number of things we're working on. So we've been doing that in the 
background and we're not ready yet to pull the string on the curtain. But 
we've got some great things th
ere. We're working on them. Very, very proud 
of and very, very excited about.
 
But for us, we care about every detail and when you care about every detail 
and getting it right, it takes a bit longer to do that and that's always been 
the case, that's not som
ething that just occur. As you probably know from 
following us for a long time, we didn't ship the first MP3 player, nor the first 
smartphone, nor the first tablet. In fact, there were tablets being shipped a 
decade or so before then, but arguably, we ship
ped the first successful 
modern tablet and the first successful modern smartphone and the first 
successful modern MP3 player. And so it means much more to us to get it 
right than to be first.
 
I think you can see so many examples out in the marketplace, whe
re it's 
clear that the objective has been to be first. But customers at the end of the 
day don't care about that. That's not what they look for from Apple. They 
want great, insanely great and that's what we want to deliver, and so that's 
the way we look at
 
it.
 
From an acquisition point of view, we have done 24 in 18 months. That 
shows that we're on the prowl, I suppose you could say. We look for 
companies that have great people and great technology and that fit 
culturally. And we don't have a rule that says
 
we can't spend a lot or 
whatever. We'll spend what we think is a fair price. What's important to us is 
that strategically it makes sense and that it winds up adding value to our 
shareholders over the long haul. We are not in a race to spend the most or 
ac
quire the most. We're in a race to make the worlds' best product that 
really enrich people's lives.
 
So, to the tune that acquisitions can help us do that and they've done that 
and continue to do that, then we will acquire it. And so you can bet that you 
wi
ll continue to see acquisitions and some of which we'll try to keep quiet 
and some of which seems to be impossible to keep quiet.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question please?

Shannon S. Cross 

 
Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you. First I just want to tell Peter, thank you very much, we've really 
enjoyed working with you over the past 10 years. But then secondly, in 
terms of a question for Tim, can you talk a bit about the compe
titive 
landscape for smartphone? If you look at some of your competitors seem to 
be have cut prices fairly quickly in the most recent product cycle, perhaps 
faster than before. You've got Microsoft about to close on Nokia. Lenovo is 
buying Motorola, there 
is a lot going on from a sort of competitive 
standpoint. So I'm curious as to how you're seeing the market?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes, there is a lot of moving parts, a lot of acquisitions, a lot of people giving 
up to some degree and deciding to do other things
. But at the end of the day 
we see it much like we've always seen it, as the part of the market that 
we're interested in is the market of people that really want the best 
smartphone and that doesn't mean that they're all at the high end of the 
price stand.
 
I mean, we have smartphones that go down to a very affordable 
price with the 4S because we're proud to ship that product.
 
I think that this quarter, if you were unsure, hopefully this quarter 
demonstrates to you that we can do well in a number of geograph
ies from 
emerging markets to develop markets. Some of the numbers that we've 
experienced just to quote some of the more historic prepaid market through 
the first half of 2014; Brazil was up 61%, Russia was up 97%, Turkey was 
up 56%, India was up 55%, Vietn
am was up 262%.
 
I could go on, but the point is that there's a number of markets out there 
where we are beginning to really catch on to a number of customers, and I 
am particularly proud of the results in these markets because these have not 
been historic 
strong points for Apple. We've been working at China for a 
while and have learned a lot and I'm very proud of what we've done there. 
But I think some of these other numbers I just read demonstrates that we're 
beginning to have really nice success outside o
f there as well.
 
Shannon S. Cross 

 
Cross Research LLC
 
Great and then, if you can just, actually as a follow
-
up on the China side, I 
think it grew at 13% year
-
over
-
year, and you mentioned obviously China 
Mobile has been the driver of that. But can you talk
 
about some of the other 
categories as well, and perhaps some of the other carriers in terms of where 
you're seeing demand out of China?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes, really great question. We did have an all
-
time revenue record in Greater 
China, just under $10 bil
lion at $9.8 billion. iPhone sales were up 28%, 
that's versus the IDCs market forecast of 20% growth. So we gained share. 
Mac units were up double
-
digit, in particular they were up 13%, and that's 
far outpacing IDCs PC market forecast of a negative 8%. So 
we gained share 
there as well.
 
If you look at the iTunes software and services revenue in China, we more 
than doubled it. Year
-
over
-
year, we were in the triple digits percentages. 
And if you look at iPad and you take out the channel inventories, ins and 
ou
ts and look at demand instead of sell in, we grew by 6% and that 


because we were able to come to an agr

carrier. That was certainly key, but as you can tell from the rest of these 
numbers there are other things going on.
 

out that if you look at so

-
time iPhone 
buyers, people that bought the iPhone 4s, 85% were first
-
time iPhone 
buyers, and the 5c, 69% first
-
time iPhone buyers. So these are 
extraordinary, and as you would expect, these are also heavily Android 
s
witchers. 62% of the people that bought the 4s switched from Android. 

incredibly pleased with this.
 
For the first half, including our retail stores, Greater China revenue topped 
$19 b
illion. So this is a 21% year
-
over
-
year, and is our fastest growing 

big way. We plan to triple the number of Apple Retail Stores over the next 


out channels.
 

we need to be on the rest of our product line and even the 40,000 is a low 
number in considering the broad landmass and the 
number of folks in China.

Good questions, Gene. The reason that I stripped off the hobby label is that 
when you look at the sales

content that was bought directly off of Apple TV for 2013, that number was 

over $1 billion as a hobby. Also from an investment p

from that point of view either.
 
We had HBO GO already on Apple TV and you have to authenticate in order 
to use it, but you have to do that with Amazon service as 
well from my brief 
read of their announcement. I think they in addition to that got some older 
content from HBO to put on there.
 
I haven't had a chance to evaluate exactly what it is and don't have a 
personal point of view on that yet. But if I look broadl
y at the content on 
Apple TV, I think it compares extremely favorable to the content that is on 
the Amazon box. We've sold now, Gene, about 20 million of the Apple TV, 
and so we've got a pretty large installed base there. And I'm feeling quite 
good about t
hat business and where it can go.

Tim Cook
 

exciting time at Apple and I'd like to review some of the highlights of our 

rence 
last month with over 20 million people from around the world watching our 
keynote session, which is the a record. We've had overwhelming response 
from customers and developers to the new features we previewed in OS X 
Yosemite and iOS 8. Yosemite has 
been redesigned with a fresh look and 
powerful new apps and iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the 
App Store. With powerful continuity features, these upcoming releases will 
allow Macs and iOS devices to work together in even smarter ways.
 
Cu
stomers can start on activity like writing an email on one device and pass 
it to another, picking up where they left off without missing a beat. They will 
even be able to make and receive iPhone calls on their Mac with just a click. 
These are features that
 
only Apple can deliver. With iOS 8, we have opened 
over 4000 APIs providing more flexibility and opportunity for developers 
than ever before. iOS 8 provides developers with amazing new frameworks, 
enables wide use of Touch ID to securely authenticate user
s within apps and 
lets developers further customize the user experience with major 
extensibility features such as third
-
party keyboards.
 
We have also introduced Swift, an innovative new programming language for 
both iOS and OS X. Swift is the result of the
 
latest research on programming 
languages, combined with decades of experience within building Apple 
platforms. It makes writing code interactive and fun, eliminates entire 
classes of unsafe code and generates apps that run lightning fast. It's easy 
to lea
rn, allowing even more people to dream big and create whole new 
categories of apps. We believe our new OS releases, combined with Swift 

to what developers will create with Yosemit
e, iOS 8 and Swift.
 
When we introduced iOS 7 years ago, it was a revolutionary operating 
system for iPhone. Over the years we've extended it to the iPod family with 
iPod Touch and later to a tablet form factor with iPad. An explosion of apps, 
accessories a
nd services for these devices has created an incredibly vibrant 

around the world make iPhones and iPads an essential part of their lives, at 

utting a huge effort into 
delivering the best experience to our customers wherever they use iOS. That 
includes a safe and intuitive user interface for driving, called CarPlay, which 
is being integrated by 29 major car brands including Audi, BMW, Ford, 
Gene
ral Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, Toyota and Volvo; and after
-
market systems like Pioneer and Alpine.
 

health and fitness apps work to together and empowers customers to choose 
what 
health data they share. We're taking the first steps in this area in 
collaboration with the Mayo clinic, whose new apps can automatically receive 
data from a blood pressure app, for example and share it with a physician, 
or a nutrition app can inform fitne
ss apps how many calories are being 
consumed each day. Our ARM health app will provide an easy to read 
dashboard of all health and fitness data.
 
We're enabling new ways to control light and doors and thermostats and 
other connected devices around the house
 
using Siri with the HomeKit 
feature of iOS 8. And in the Enterprise, we are including new security, 
productivity and device management features in iOS 8. We forged a 
relationship with IBM to deliver a new class of mobile business solutions to 
enterprise c
ustomers around the world. We are working together to provide 
companies access to the power of Big Data analytics, right on every 
employee's iPhone or iPad. Using Swift, we will collaborate to bring over 100 
Mobile First apps to enterprise clients, each ad
dressing a specific industry 
need or opportunity.
 
This is a radical step for Enterprise and opens up a large market opportunity 

our enterprise customers. From the pocket to the c
ar, to the workplace, 
home and gym, we have a very large vision of what iOS can be and we're 
incredibly excited about our plans.
 
Turning to our financial results, today we are reporting record June quarter 
revenue, thanks to the very strong performance of 
iPhone, Mac and the 
continued growth of revenue from the Apple ecosystem. Our teams executed 
brilliantly during the quarter with earnings per share up 20% year
-
over
-
year, our highest growth rate in seven quarters.
 
We sold over 35 million iPhones, setting a
 
new third quarter record. We 
generated healthy growth in our entry priced, mid
-
tier and lead iPhone 
categories. I'm especially happy about our progress in the BRIC countries, 
where iPhone sales were up a very strong 55% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We also had a recor
d June quarter for Mac sales, with growth of 18% year
-
over
-

estimate. Demand has been very strong for our portables in particular and 
we've have had a great customer response to the new high
er performance, 
lower priced MacBook Air. It was another strong performance for the App 
Store and the other services contributing to the thriving Apple ecosystem.
 
In fact for the first nine months of this fiscal year, the line item that we call 
iTunes soft
ware and services has been the fastest growing part of our 
business. iTunes billings grew 25% year
-
over
-
year in the June quarter and 
reached an all
-
time quarterly high, thanks to the very strong results from 
the App Store. We're continuing to invest in our
 
incredible ecosystem, which 
is a huge asset for Apple and a very important differentiator of our customer 

many of yours. Our sales were gated in
-
part by a reduction in channel 
in
ventory and in
-
part by market softness in certain parts of the world. For 

tablet market, as well as a decline in the Western European tablet market in 
the June quarter.
 

t important to us is that customers are enjoying their iPads 
and using them heavily. In a survey conducted in May by ChangeWave, iPad 
Air registered a 98% customer satisfaction rate, while iPad Mini with retina 
display received an astonishing 100% customer
 
satisfaction rate. The survey 
also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 
63% plan to buy an iPad and our own data indicates that more than half of 
customers purchasing an iPad are buying their very first iPad.
 
Another recen
t study by Custora found that iPad accounts for 80% of all U.S. 
tablet based e
-
commerce purchases. We're very bullish about the future of 
the tablet market and we're confident that we can continue to bring 
significant innovation to this category through ha
rdware, software and 
services. We think our partnership with IBM, providing a new generation of 


catalyst for f
uture iPad growth.
 
Looking ahead, we are very excited about our agreement to purchase Beats 

the addition of Beats team will be great for music lovers. Beats provides 
Apple with a fa
ntastic subscription music service, access to rare talent and a 
fast growing line up of products that we can build upon. Not counting Beats, 
we've completed 29 acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal year 2013 
including five since the end of the March q
uarter and we have brought some 
incredible technology and more importantly some incredible talent into Apple 
in the process. We are hard at work and investing heavily on exciting 
opportunities across our business and we have an incredible pipeline of new 
p

 
With that I would like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our Q3 results 
in more detail.
 
Luca Maestri
 
Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. We set a new June quarter 
record for revenue at $37
.4 billion, up $2.1 billion or 6% year
-
over
-
year. 
This result was towards the high end of our guidance range, despite a 
reduction in channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad. The revenue growth 
was driven by strong sales of iPhones and Macs, as well as t
he continued 
great performance of iTunes softwares and services. Gross margin was 
39.4%, above our guidance range and operating margin was $10.3 billion, 
representing 27.5% of revenue. Net income was $7.7 billion, translating to 
diluted earnings per share 
of $1.28, a 20% year
-
over
-
year increase.
 
For details by product, I'd like to start with iPhone. We sold 35.2 million 
iPhones, an increase of 4 million over last year, representing 13% growth. 
As Tim mentioned, iPhone sales grew well across all three of our
 
entry
-
price, 
mid
-
tier and lead product categories.
 
In the U.S., iPhone accounts for 41.9% of the smartphone subscriber base 
according to the latest data from ComScore, up from 41.3% in the previous 
measurement period. Also based on the latest survey by Ch
angeWave, 
iPhone earned a 97% customer satisfaction rate and among responders 
planning purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 50% planned to purchase 
an iPhone, up from 42% in the March quarter and 44% a year ago.
 
iPhone sales were at the high end of our ex
pectations, despite new product 
rumors that we believe resulted in purchase delay. In addition, tax increases 
and the regulatory environment in Japan affected smartphone sales in what 

Con
sidering these factors, the performance of iPhone was even more 
impressive in the June quarter and it boosts our confidence for the future. 
We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 150,000 from the end of the 
March quarter, leaving us within our target
 
range of four to six weeks.
 
Apple continues to innovate through hardware, software and services to 
make iPhone the best smartphone for business. Today, companies have 
equipped millions of employees with iPhones and they are seeing 
tremendous benefits in p
roductivity, employee satisfaction and profitability. 
For instance medical device leader Medtronic has developed over 175 
internal iOS apps for over 16,500 iPhones used by its employees to facilitate 
sales, improve productivity and ensure that essential ma
rketing materials 
are up to date. Throughout the global offices of Nestle, the largest food 
company in the world, over 25,000 iPhones are accessing corporate 
networks, improving communication and connecting employees to critical 
internal resources. And at 
NASA over 26,000 iPhones are in use by 
scientists, flight crew members, technicians and researchers.
 
Turning to iPad, we sold
 
13.3
 
million units, compared to 14.6 million in the 
June quarter last year. iPad sales grew overall in the developing 
markets 
with particularly strong year
-
over
-
year growth in the Middle
-
East, where 
iPad sales were up 64%, in China where they grew 51%, and in India, where 
they were up 45%. This growth was more than offset by lower sales in more 
mature markets. We reduced 
iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the 
end of the March quarter, which left us within our target range of four to six 
weeks.
 
In the Enterprise, global companies are using iPad to improve customer 
service, boost work and productivity and enhance critica
l processes. iPad 
continues to be the standard for teams across the airline industry. Qantas 
Airlines has over 15,000 iPads deployed to pilots as well as cabin, customer 
service and ground crews to enhance key processes across the daily 
operations and gove
rnments are deploying thousands of iPads worldwide. 
One of the largest examples is Sweden, where over 100,000 iPads are being 
used by local government offices across the country.
 
In education, iPad remains the tablet of choice with 85% share of the U.S. 
ed
ucation tablet market according to the latest published estimate from IDC. 

bringing teachers and students great new tools to build an experience 
educational count into an iPad. As of th
is month, teachers using the free 
iTunes U app can create, edit and manage entire courses that are on iPad for 
the first time and students can discover new ways to collaborate, including 
the ability to start class discussions and ask questions right from t
heir iPad.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.4 million Macs, compared to 
under 3.8 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 18% year
-
over
-
year 
and a new June quarter record. The increase was driven by portables, 
thanks to very strong g
rowth of MacBook Air. We achieved strong double 
digit Mac growth across many countries, including the U.S. Canada, Mexico, 
the UK, Germany, France, Australia, China, India and the Middle
-
East. This 
growth is particularly impressive, given the contraction o
f the overall PC 
market. Macs have now gained global market share for 32 of the last 33 
quarters.
 
Macs performed well in the U.S. education buying season with double
-
digit 
growth in the K to 12 market, driven primarily by large deployments of 
MacBook Air. 
The Shawnee Mission School District in Kansas chose Apple to 
provide an entire solution that will equip every teacher with a MacBook Air 
and an iPad Air, every high school student with a MacBook Air and every 
middle school and elementary student with an iP
ad. The Rowan
-
Salisbury 
School System in North Carolina is deploying thousands of MacBook Airs to 
students and teachers in grades 9 to 12 as part of the district's digital 
learning initiatives.
 
We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below
 
our four to 
five week target range. The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive. 
Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.5 billion, an 
increase of 12% year
-
over
-
year. Our iTunes stores generated all time record 
billings of $5.4 billion
 
in the June quarter, up 25% year
-
over
-
year, driven by 
very strong growth in App Store sales. These items billings translated to 
quarterly iTunes revenue of almost $2.6 billion, up 8% from the year ago 
quarter. Software and services revenue was $1.9 billio
n, up 19% from a 
year ago.
 
App Store momentum remains very strong and cumulative app downloads 
has topped 75 billion. We continue be amazed by our vibrant and diverse 
developer community and we are extremely proud that our developers have 
now earned over 2
0 billion for sales of their apps through the App Store, 
nearly half of which have been earned in the past 12 months. This number 
truly stands out among our competition as our developers continue to 
benefit from the broad reach and powerful design of the A
pp Store, coupled 

 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $164.5 
billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $13.9 
billion. Our domestic cash was $26
.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, a 
sequential increase of $8.3 billion and $137.7 billion or 84% of our total cash 
was offshore. Cash flow from operations was $10.3 billion.
 
We executed another very successful debt offering in April, issuing a to
tal of 
12 billion in notes across 3, 5, 7, 10 and 30 year maturities. In addition, 
during the quarter, we entered the commercial paper market for the first 
time with $2 billion in short
-
term obligations outstanding as of the end of 
June. We also continued 
to execute our shareholder return program with 
$8.3 billion of capital returned to inventors during the June quarter. We 
spent $5 billion to repurchase 59 million Apple shares to open market 
transactions. We paid almost $2.9 billion in dividends and equiva
lents and 
utilized over $400 million to net share settle vesting employee RSUs.
 
We've now taken action on over $74 billion of our $130 billion capital return 
program, including $51 billion in share repurchases with six quarters 
remaining to its completion.
 
And finally our Board has declared a dividend of 
$0.47 per common share payable on August 14, 2014 to shareholders of 
record as of record as of August 11, 2014.
 

outlook which includes the
 
types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 
$37 billion and $40 billion, compared to $37.5 billion in the year ago 
quarter. We expect gross margin to between 37% and 38%. We exp
ect 
OpEx to be between $4.75 billion and $4.85 billion. We expect OI&E to be 
about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%. Finally, 
we expect the Beats transaction to close this quarter and we expect the 
acquisition to be accreted to our
 
earnings in our fiscal 2015.
 
With that, let me open the call to questions.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one 
follow
-
up please. Operator, may we have the first question.
 
Question
-
And
-
Answer Session
 
Ope
rator
 
(Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from Katy Huberty 
with Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Luca, this is the third quarter in a row that gross margin came in above your 

that gap and why you expect 
the margin to come down sequentially in the September quarter?
 
Luca Maestri
 
Yes, Katy, it was obviously a surprise also to us. We were expecting 
obviously a loss in leverage from the sequential declining revenue which 
obviously 
happened. We also expect that some unfavorable mix, which also 
happens 
--
 
it's typical as we move away from the launch quarter. And we 
were expecting some cost improvements. These cost improvements came in. 
They came in stronger than we were anticipating. 
The commodity markets 
continue to be favorable, the product quality continues to be excellent, our 
teams executed really, really well. And all these things came together at the 
same time and it was a very nice surprise for us. As we look forward into 
Q4, y

we see as we continue to move through the product cycle. And obviously in 

We're bit excited about what we've go

why we guided to that range.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
And then just a follow
-
up on that last point, because in the press release you 
referenced the excitement about new products and services. Can you remind 
us 
of your guidance philosophy as it relates to product cycles? Do you 
embed assumptions around the contribution from new products? And if so, 

shipped today?
 
Luca Maestri
 
So our guidance, 
Katy is that 
--
 
we put our numbers that we believe at this 
point in time with all the information that is available to us, we're going to 

delays for executing Q3, but we have seen 
some safe trends in certain 
geographies. That continues to happen. And what you see this quarter is 
that our guidance range is $3 billion, as opposed to $2 billion during the 
third quarter, just to take into account the fact that we got many moving 
pieces.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you Katy. Can we have the next question please?

From Goldman Sachs, we will hear from Bill Shope.
 
Bill Shope

Goldman Sachs
 
With the pockets of market we just noted for tablets, could you give us some 
more detail on how you 
are thinking about the category longer term, and in 
particular in the context of your usage comments, how are you thinking 
about the competitive landscape now and how that may evolve? And then I 
guess, related to that, what do you think to be the next driv
er of renewed 
growth for the category?
 
Tim Cook
 

which has just been a little over four years, we have now sold 225 million 
iPads, which is I think probably a larger number than anyon
e would have 
predicted at the time and including ourselves, quite frankly. We still feel that 
category as a whole is in its early days and that there is also significant 
innovation that can be brought to the iPad and we plan on doing that. When 
I look at t
he top level numbers, I get really excited when I see that more 
than 50% of the iPads that we're selling are going to someone who is a first 
time tablet buyer. I get excited when I see that our retail share according to 
the MPD in the month of June was 59%
 
of UNIX and over 70% in terms of 
dollars. And of course, Luca has mentioned in his preamble that our 
education share is 85%.
 
We also are in the 
--
 
virtually all Fortune 500 companies, we are in 99% of 
them to be exact and 93% of the Global 500. However, w
hen we dig into the 
business market deeper, though our market share in the U.S., in the 
commercial sector is good at 76% 
--
 
this is according to IDC; the 

context, if you looked 
at penetration of notebooks in business, it would be 
over 60%. And so we think that there is a substantial upside in business. 
And this was one of the thinkings behind the partnership with IBM that we 
announced last week. We think that the core thing that 
unleashes this is a 
better go to market, which IBM clearly brings to the table, but even more 
importantly apps that are written with Mobile First in mind. Not all but many 
of the enterprises apps that have been written for iPad have been essentially 
ports 

mobile.
 
And so we're excited about bringing that to business along with partnering 
with IBM, which we think is a first class company. And seeing what that can 
do to sales of business, which I h
onestly believe the opportunity is huge. The 
market is still predicted in 2018 
--
 
I think these are Gartner numbers 
--
 
to 
be about 350 million in size and put that in some context, I think the PC 
market right now is about 315 million.
 
And so I think our th
eory that has been there honestly since the first time 
that we shipped iPad, that the tablet market would eventually surpass the 
PC market, that theory is still intact. I just think we have to do some more 
things to get the business side of it moving in a 
faster trajectory and I think 
we're now on to something that can really do that. So as I look at it and sort 
of back up from the 90 day clock kind of thing, I'm incredibly excited. I'm 
excited about the plans that we have on the product side and also on th
e go 
to market side, and in particular the IBM announcement.
 
One other point I might add on this, because I think this is interesting. I 

bifurcated on iPad. In the BRIC countries, iPad 
did extremely well. The 
growth was very high. Like in the China it was in the 50%s, in the Middle 
East it was in the 60%s. Luca may have mentioned those numbers. In the 

interesting
 
to note however that the U.S. as an example, we had a very, 
very strong Macintosh market in the U.S. and so there is probably a bit of 
higher add kind of stuff beginning to play out too, where higher add is 
clearly still very much notebook oriented. K12 o
n the other hand, we sell 2.5 
iPads for every Mac in the K12. And so we're clearly headed into that season 
now and it typically starts in graduation time prime in fiscal Q3 for us. And 

 
Bill Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
One more question if I could. You've had obviously great performance in the 
BRIC countries and you've touched on China for few categories. Can you talk 
about the overall demand environment you saw for China in the quarter? 
Obviously there's
 
some seasonal factors to consider but how should we think 
about your performance versus your expectations and how you are thinking 
about it for the rest of the calendar year?
 
Tim Cook
 
China, honestly was surprising to us that it was 
--
 
we thought it would
 
be 
strong but it well went past what we thought. We came in at 26% of 
revenue growth, including retail and if you look at the units, the unit growth 
was really off the charts across the board. I found 48% off that compares to 
a market estimate of 24%. So 
growing it two times the market. iPad was up 


the world and China was projected to contract by 5%. And so w
e're seeing 

most is the iTunes software and services category, which has the App Store 
and et cetera and that area is almost doubling year
-
over
-
year.
 

what we're seeing there. We are still in the 
process of rolling out along with our partner China Mobile, the TD
-
LTE into 
more cities and we're still in early going on that. That just started in January 
as you know. And my understanding is that later this y
ear there will be a 
license for the other operators to begin shipping FDD
-
LTE, which I think is 
another big opportunity in China.
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Thank you, Bill. Could we have the next question please?
 
Operator
 
Next we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford B
ernstein.
 
Toni Sacconaghi

Sanford Bernstein
 
I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca, I wanted to revisit the 
gross margin question. You talked about guidance for next quarter, that the 
drivers of the sequential decline being a normal mix through
 
the cycle on 
transition cost. Your guidance to the midpoint is down 190 basis points in 
gross margin, last year in Q4 gross margins were up 10 basis points 
sequentially in fiscal Q4 and the product transition issues or cycle issues that 
you alluded to see
m essentially identical. So I'd like to try and understand 

 
Luca Maestri
 
If I understand the question, also when you look at it in terms of absolute 
levels of gross margin, last year it was 37%. So o
ur range is above that 
level. There is obviously many, many things that affect us in different ways 
from one year to the other. Foreign exchange is a case where a lot of the 
emerging market currencies and the yen and the Australian dollar, the 
Canadian dol
lar, they have been weaker against the U.S. dollar. That has an 
impact on margin. And also when you think our product cycle, I think we 

had a year ago.
 
Toni Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford B
ernstein
 
I mean is it better? If we look back two years to the iPhone 5, your product 
margins were down 260 basis points sequentially. So is the reference there 
that we should be thinking in terms of changes that are more akin to what 
we saw two years ago 
rather than to this year?
 
Luca Maestri
 

from the fact that we had a very, very strong Q3. A lot of things came 
together extremely well. 37% to 38% is a range that is 
--
 
we think is 
very 

the quarter.
 
Toni Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Tim, I wanted to get your input on the impact of trade
-
in programs for the 
iPhone, particularly in mature markets where they ar
e most prevalent. As 
best I can tell, if I look at the last four quarters, they're not hyper
-
focused 
on 90 days. It looks like the iPhone has been about flat in unit terms in the 
Americas and up low single digits in Europe and I think Europe includes 
India
, which is obviously very fast growing. So perhaps low single digits in 
Europe. So if we look at those western geographies, we've seen relatively 

just sort of based on overall re
venue reporting, I'm wondering if you can 
comment on what you're seeing in terms of iPhone trade
-
in programs and 
this is four quarters, still over a complete cycle. Whether you think they are 
elongating or shrinking and what impact is very prevalent, incre
asingly 
prevalent trade
-
in programs might be having on them and what impact your 
pricing of older generation devices might be having on them.
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes, the theory that you have Toni is not precisely correct. Like if I look at 
Europe, the operating segment of Europe for quarter or year
-
to
-
date for 
2014 versus the same period last year, iPhone units were actually up 10%. 
Your more macro question; what 
I understand to be your macro question of 
do I think there is some sort of cannibalization going on trade
-
in programs 
on new product sales? What I think is happening in the aggregate if you look 
across the world is that trade
-
ins are actually hugely benefi
cial for our 
ecosystem because people wind up 
--
 
we have more people that are able to 
join the party when we have a trade
-
in, because in essence, it winds up 
being used by 
--
 
probably the prime example someone else within the family 
or in the example that 
has become more common in the last year, someone 
trades it in and then that goes to either somebody else in that country that 
is very price sensitive or somebody in a different country and I see all of this 
as good.
 
In looking at how much of it cannibalize
s, it is very hard to answer that 
question with any degree of preciseness. But my gut is that the 
cannibalization factor is low, because you wind up having 
--
 
you wind up 
attracting people that are much more price sensitive in there. I think the 
great thin
g is that our products command a much higher resale value than 
others do. And so that leads to a larger trade
-
in and from my perspective, 
that being the larger ecosystem, more people that wind up getting on 
iPhone, and as you know from following us for qui
te some time, if we get 
somebody to try an Apple product and then buy an Apple product, the 
likelihood that they begin buying other Apple products that may be in 
different categories or upgrading to one in that category and the future is 
very high. And so 
net
-

quantify with certainty.

From UBS, we will hear from Steve Milunovich.

Tim you mentioned that Ja
pan was fairly flat due to regulations and taxes. 
Could you elaborate on that and what kind of comparisons perhaps you see 
going forward?
 
Tim Cook
 
Yes, it was actually Luca, but I can comment on it. VAT was increased from 
5% to 8% close to the beginning of
 
the quarter. I think it was actually April 
1 or so. That was the first planned VAT increase. There are other or at least 
one additional planned VAT increase in the future. This was a part of the 
overall tax reform package in Japan. Secondly, the carriers 
received some 
guidance from the regulators to essentially stop incenting people to transfer 
from another carrier at a higher amount than they were incenting their 
--
 
retaining their own customers. And so it appears that the combination of 
these two things 
dampened the whole market for smartphones in Japan.
 

is we're not going to see very much of a share change. And we are 
beginning to see some coming back of that market as we step int
o this 
quarter, may be not back to the level that it was previously but you can 
begin to see the market growing again which we view as very positive. In 
the past when we've seen these type of things, tax changes et cetera, there 
is usually a rush to buy be
fore the tax increase, a pause that happens 
thereafter and then the market eventually goes back to some kind of steady 
state that may not be exactly where it was but it nears it. And so I think 

 
The other 
piece is a little harder to conclude what will happen in terms of that guidance 

 
Steve Milunovich

iPhones.
 
I wonder if you would be willing to breakout in any more detail the 
growth and particularly how to defend the 5C in the mid
-
tier. I know our 
surveys continue to find in the U.S. that it's falling little bit as a percentage 
of business but you seem to beli

to do.
 
Tim Cook
 

each one but if you look at year
-
over
-
year growth rates and so this would be 
comparing the 5C to last year. It would 
be comparing the 4S, which was in 
the mid
-
tier. The growth in that sector was the highest growth during the 
quarter we just finished.
 
Steve Milunovich

Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
 
Kulbinder Garcha

Credit Suisse
 
Thanks. I have just one question for Luca and one for Tim. And for Luca, you 
mentioned that comm
odity pricing, I guess the environment was good for 
you. Is it your working assumption in your guidance that continued to be 
favorable and a tailwind for you? And then my question for Tim is, with the 
installment plans that are being introduced in the U.S.
, I imagine that given 
the increases in flexibility for people to operate faster, would you expect that 
to happen? Are you seeing any evidence as these contests come up because 
we've had them out now for several months? And how do you see that 
impacting yo
ur business because obviously the U.S. iPhone part of your 
business is still very significant and it can be quite a big catalyst to your 
iPhone business going forward I would imagine or would you be more tensed 
in how these are playing out?
 
Tim Cook
 
I will
 
take both of these. This is Tim. On the component question, what we 
saw in the June quarter was that NAND, mobile DRAM and LCD, the pricing 
on all of those declined, while PC DRAM increased, despite the market for 
PCs contracting. In the September quarter
, what is factored in our guidance 
is that LCDs and mobile DRAM continue to decline, that NAND pricing 
remains essentially flat last quarter and that PC DRAM has a slight price 

ass

into the gross margin guidance that Luca gave you. In terms of the 
installment plans that you mentioned in the U.S. relative to iPhone, there is 
a lot of different models that are bein
g tried in the U.S. and throughout the 
world. And actually last quarter, as we estimated and this is subject to 
estimating but we're estimating that less than one out of four iPhones were 
sold on a traditional subsidy plan. And so that number is markedly d
ifferent 
than it would have been two years ago.
 
The installment plan that you're speaking about which gives the customer 
the right to upgrade SAP or faster than a usual two year cycle, we think that 
plays to our customer base in a large way. And so 
that makes us incredibly 
bullish that customers on those plans would be very likely to upgrade when 
we announce a new product.

Thanks a lot. Tim, questions for you. I guess during the quarter you did two 
very big things in our opinion, obviously buying Beats, biggest acquisition in 
your history and you also did this IBM deal, which obviously was in this 
quart
er, but since the last call, and that was very interesting, obviously 
really collaborating with another huge company to get further into the 

changing? These seem like big deals that 
change your direction a bit, 

more partnerships and larger acquisitions on the horizon to grow your TAM 
in various markets?
 
Tim Cook
 
Well, I think we have a lot of really great people a
nd I think we have the 
capability. As I've said before, I think we have the capability to acquire a 
sizable company and manage it. And relative to IBM, I feel the same way. I 
think you can only do so many partnerships well, and so it is unusual that 
we ent
er into a partnership. But in this particular case, I think arguably the 
companies are so complementary, and I've gotten to know Gini fairly well 
over the last couple of years and I think we see the importance of the 
customer, a lot of the same way and bot
h feel that Mobile and Enterprise is 

And so I think a partnership in that case is particularly great. Would we do 

ition 


 
And so with Beats we felt we were getting an incredible subscription service, 
a very rare set of talent that we think can do great things in App
le and 
access to a very fast growing businesses in their headphone and earphone 
space. And culturally we felt there was a match and music has been deeply 

marriage and I think the partnersh
ip with IBM is a great marriage as well. 

--
 
or I think we can manage more 
things. I think that we have a very, very strong executive team and can do 

 
or spend a 
certain amount of money. We want to do things that help us make great 
products that are great for our customers and so forth.

I am sorry, just really quick on the IBM. Does this say something about 
Apple doing more in Big

generally speaking, I think that each of us have revenue streams in the 
enterprise and each of us 
went from having those revenue streams. So 

number I spoke about from 20% to 60%. That would be incredibly exciting

Tim, I just wanted to talk about the app market for Enterprise. Right now I 
believe that app developers can 
sell to the enterprise directly and therefore 
that they can bypass sharing revenue from these app sales with Apple. Is 
Apple going to allow that to continue, and can you also just more broadly 
discuss how Apple thinks about the opportunity to sell apps dir
ectly to the 
enterprise?
 
Tim Cook
 
We have no plans to change the rules with Enterprise. Some enterprises like 
proprietary apps that they do not want to offer to others and so we 
obviously have a way for them to distribute those into their enterprise or 
jus
t the employees that they want to and so I'm not worried about changing 

the big thing for us is getting the penetration number, I think getting our 
product, iPhones and iPads and 
Macs in more people hands and we think 
there is a huge opportunity in Enterprise to do that.

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Nancy, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Today we're proud 
to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to th
e 
strong performance of iPhone, services and wearables. We generated $53.3 
billion in revenue, a new Q3 record. That's an increase of 17% over last 
year's result, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating 
growth, our fourth consecutive quar
ter of double
-
digit growth and our 
strongest rate of growth in the past 11 quarters.
 
Our team generated record Q3 earnings per share of $2.34, an increase of 
40% over last year. We're extremely proud of these results and I'd like to 
share some highlights w
ith you.
 
First, iPhone had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 20% year
-
over
-
year and our active installed base grew by double
-
digits, driven by 
switchers, first time smartphone buyers and our existing customers whose 
loyalty we greatly appreciate. iPhon
e X was the most popular iPhone in the 
quarter once again, with a customer satisfaction score of 98% according to 
451 Research. Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than 
the global smartphone market, gaining share in many markets including
 
the 
U.S., Greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico and the 
Middle East and Africa.
 
Second, we had a stellar quarter in services which generated all
-
time record 
revenue of $9.5 billion fueled in part by double
-
digit growth in our overall 
a
ctive installed base. We feel great about the momentum of our services 
business and we're on target to reach our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 
services revenue by 2020. Our record services results were driven by strong 
performance in a number of areas a
nd I'd like to briefly mention just some 
of these.
 
Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed $300 
million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone. Revenue from 
subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing pe
rcentage of our 
overall services business. What's more, the number of apps offering 
subscriptions also continue to grow. There are almost 30,000 available in the 
App Store today.
 
The App Store turned 10 years old this month and we set a new June 
quarter re
venue record. The App Store has exceeded our wildest 
expectations, igniting a cultural and economic phenomenon that has 
changed how people work, learn and play. Customers around the world are 
visiting the App Store more often and downloading more apps than
 
ever 
before. And based on third party research estimates, the App Store 
generated nearly twice the revenue of Google Play so far in 2018.
 
The app economy is thriving and thanks to the App Store, it's generating 
jobs for tens of millions of people around t
he world. Our developers have 
earned over $100 billion from the App Store since its launch and we couldn't 
be more proud of them and what they've accomplished. We're hearing lots 
of developer excitement around our upcoming OS releases, which I'll talk 
abou
t more in a moment, and can't wait to see what they can come up with 
next.
 
We've experienced rapid growth in our App Store search ad service and as 
we announced earlier this month, we are expanding our geographic 
coverage to Japan, South Korea, France, Ger
many, Italy and Spain. We're 
also seeing strong growth in many of the other services as well. Just a few 
examples, Apple Music grew by over 50% on a year
-
over
-
year basis. 
AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in 18 quarters, partly due to our 
expanded
 
distribution initiative. Cloud services revenue was also up over 
50% year
-
over
-
year. Our communications services are experiencing record 
usage. We've hit all
-
time highs for both the number of monthly active users 
of Messages and the number of FaceTime cal
ls made with growth 
accelerating from the March to June quarters.
 
Siri requests have already exceeded 100 billion so far this fiscal year, and 
the number of articles read on Apple News more than doubled year
-
over
-
year. Apple Pay continues to expand with we
ll over 1 billion transactions last 
quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago, with growth accelerating 
from the March quarter. To put that tremendous growth into perspective, 
this past quarter, we completed more total transactions than great 
compani
es like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal.
 
Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank 
partners and we look forward to adding Germany later this year. We're 
excited to share that in the U.S., eBay is beginning to enable
 
its sellers to 
accept Apple Pay and CVS Pharmacy and 7
-
Eleven will roll out Apple Pay 
acceptance in locations nationwide this fall. Transit is another important area 
of growth and Apple Pay can be used with iPhone and Apple Watch to quickly 
and convenient
ly ride public transit in 12 metropolitan areas. Apple Pay 
Cash, our peer
-
to
-
peer payment service, is already serving millions of 
customers across the U.S. less than eight months following its launch.
 
Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding r
esults in wearables 
which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats and was up over 60% 
year
-
over
-
year with growth accelerating from the March quarter. Our 
wearables revenue exceeded $10 billion over the last four quarters, a truly 
remarkable accomplishment
 
for a set of products that has only been in the 
market for a few years. Apple Watch delivered record June quarter 
performance with growth in the mid 40% range, and we're thrilled to see so 
many customers enjoying AirPods. It reminds me of the early days o
f iPod 
when I started noticing white earbuds everywhere I went.
 
A number of other notable events in the quarter, we expanded distribution of 
HomePod to three additional markets and we added new immersive listening 
features with support for HomePod stereo p
airs and a new multi
-
room audio 
system. In June, we hosted an extremely successful developers' conference 
that previewed many major advances coming this fall to our four operating 
systems, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. Developer and customer reaction 
has b
een very positive and we have over 4 million users participating in our 
new OS beta programs.
 
Starting with iOS 12, Siri will take a major step forward with Siri Shortcuts, 
which deliver a new, much faster way to get things done and allow any app 
to work w
ith Siri. We believe this will make Siri even more useful and 
significantly expand its adoption. We've also designed performance 
improvements across iOS 12 to make everyday tasks faster and more 
responsive. Camera launches up to 70% faster. The keyboard ap
pears up to 
50% faster and apps can launch up to twice as fast.
 
We've always been about empowering users to get the most from our 
product, but not about spending all of their time using them and so we're 
adding tools to iOS 12 to help our customers underst
and and take control of 
the time both they and their families spend interacting with their iOS 
devices. Activity reports will provide information on the amount and nature 
of time spent on iPhones and iPads and screen time will enable parents to 
monitor and
 
limit their children's activity from their own iOS devices using 
Family Sharing in iCloud.
 
Developers will be able to build even more intelligent apps with just a few 
lines of code using the power of machine learning with Core ML 2 and Create 
ML. We've al
so included our third release of ARKit in only one year. With 
ARKit 2, iOS 12 will provide an even more powerful platform to make 
dynamic AR apps, integrating shared and persistent AR experiences, object 
detection and image tracking. We believe AR can enab
le profound 
experiences and Apple is uniquely positioned to provide the best AR 
experience because of the seamless integration of our hardware and 
software.
 
The new capabilities of ARKit 2 will build on the potential of the thousands of 
AR apps already ava
ilable in the App Store that are changing the way iPhone 
and iPad users see and experience the world.
 
Turning to Mac, we want to empower our developers to bring their 
innovative apps from the iOS ecosystem to the Mac with minimal effort. 
Though iOS and mac
OS are different, they've shared common foundations 
from the very beginning, so we've taken key frameworks from iOS and 
adapted them to specific Mac behaviors like using a mouse or track pad, 
resizing windows, copy and paste and drag and drop.
 
We've starte
d with some of our own apps, so this fall, News, Stocks, Voice 
Memos and Home will be available on the Mac for the first time with macOS 
Mojave and we'll be bringing these great new tools to our developers next 
year. We believe this will dramatically broad
en the ecosystem to benefit all 
Mac users, creating even more great reasons to choose Mac. Also this fall, 
the Mac App Store is getting a full redesign with rich editorial content to help 
customers discover great Mac apps from our developers.
 
We believe pr
ivacy is one of the most important issues of the 21st century 
and we're always working to make our products more private and more 
secure for our users.
 
As we announced at WWDC, beginning this fall, Safari will prevent share 
buttons and comment widgets on w
ebpages from tracking users without 
their permission. Safari already protects personal data as users browse the 
web so they won't be re
-
targeted by ads. For Apple Watch, users will see a 
significant expansion of features and functionality in watchOS 5. App
le 
Watch will become an even stronger companion for fitness, communication 
and quick access to information with features including new workouts, 
activity sharing competitions, auto workout detection, advanced running 
features, walkie
-
talkie, podcast and th
ird party apps on the Siri watch face.
 
For Apple TV, we've seen major growth in sales since the introduction of 
Apple TV 4K last fall as video providers around the world choose Apple TV 4K 
to deliver their subscription services. Later this year, 
Charter 
Communications will begin offering Apple TV 4K to its customers in nearly 50 
million U.S. households, providing access to live channels and tens of 
thousands of on
-
demand programs via the Spectrum TV app on Apple TV 
4K, iPhone and iPad.
 
And tvOS wi
ll take the cinematic experience of Apple TV 4K to the next level 
this fall with support for Dolby Atmos audio and new features to easily find 
popular shows and movies. Apple TV 4K already offers customers the largest 
collection of 4K HDR movies and this f
all, iTunes will be the home to the 
largest collection of Dolby Atmos
-
supported movies anywhere.
 
I'm proud that our team's hard work has an impact even beyond these 
innovative industry
-
leading products and services. We're always working to 
leave the world 
better than we found it and as part of our commitment to 
address climate change and increase the use of renewable energy in our 
supply chain, we recently announced a first of its kind investment fund in 
China. Initially, 10 suppliers will join us in invest
ing nearly $300 million over 
the next four years into the China Clean Energy Fund. The fund will invest in 
and develop clean energy projects totaling more than 1 gigawatt of 
renewable energy in China, the equivalent of powering nearly 1 million 
homes.
 
We'r
e seeing great momentum in our Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can 
Create initiatives. More than 5,000 schools and community colleges are now 
teaching Everyone Can Code and more than 350 schools have committed to 
incorporating Everyone Can Create into their
 
curricula for the upcoming 
school year. Coding skills are opening doors for students and job seekers 
around the world as tremendous growth in the app economy creates 
opportunity everywhere we look.
 
We're also teaming up with leading educators for blind an
d deaf communities 
across the United States who will start teaching Everyone Can Code this Fall.
 
Looking ahead, we couldn't be more excited about the products and services 
in our pipeline as well as limitless applications for augmented reality and 
machine 
learning technology. We're working with key partners in the 
enterprise to change the way work gets done with iOS and Mac. We're 
welcoming communities and offering learning opportunities at our retail 
locations through hundreds of thousands of Today at Appl
e sessions each 
quarter. We're expanding our reach into emerging markets and seeing 
strong double
-
digit growth in revenue and we're making great progress 
toward our goal of significantly expanding our services business.
 
And now, for more details on the rec
ord June quarter results, I'd like to turn 
the call over to Luca.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to report the 
financial results of our best June quarter ever. As we have done in every 
quarter this fi
scal year, we set new quarterly records for both revenue and 
earnings per share, with revenue up 17% year
-
over
-
year and EPS up 40%.
 
We generated $53.3 billion of revenue with year
-
over
-
year growth in all of 
our geographic segments and new June quarter reco
rds in the Americas, 
Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We grew in each of our top 15 
markets, with especially strong performance in the U.S., Hong Kong, Russia, 
Mexico, the Middle East and Africa, all places where revenue was up by more 
than 20%.
 
Gro
ss margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, as cost improvements and 
foreign exchange offset the seasonal loss of leverage. Net income was $11.5 
billion, up $2.8 billion or 32% over last year and it was also a new June 
quarter record. Diluted earnings per shar
e were $2.34, up 40% and also a 
new record for the June quarter and cash flow from operations was very 
strong at $14.5 billion.
 
iPhone revenue grew 20% year
-
over
-
year with iPhone ASP increasing to 
$724 from $606 a year ago, driven by the strong performance
 
of iPhone X, 
iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world.
 
During the quarter, we sold 41.3 million iPhones, with double
-
digit unit 
growth in several markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, 
Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East and Afri
ca. Our 
performance from a customer demand standpoint was stronger than our 
reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.5 million units 
during the quarter. We exited the June quarter towards the lower end of our 
target range of 5 to 7 week
s of iPhone channel inventory.
 
Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the 
highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 
Research indicates that across all iPhone models, customer satisfaction was 
96% an
d combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, it was even higher at 
98%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the 
September quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones, up 3 points from the last 
survey.
 
Turning to services, we had our best 
results ever with all
-
time record 
revenue of $9.5 billion. Services revenue included a favorable $236 million 
one
-
time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. 
Excluding this amount, services revenue was still an all
-
time record an
d the 
underlying growth rate of our services business was a terrific 28% over last 
year. We generated double
-
digit services growth in all our geographic 
segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services and 
Apple Pay all set new June quart
er records.
 
Our other product category also set a new record for the June quarter with 
revenue of over $3.7 billion. That's up 37% from last year with great sales 
momentum for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch continues to be 
the best selling smart
watch by a wide margin and units and revenue grew 
dramatically during the quarter. AirPods continue to be a runaway success 
and we've been selling them as fast as we can make them since their launch 
a year and a half ago.
 
Next, I'd like to talk about the M
ac. We were very happy to see double digit 
year
-
over
-
year growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all
-
time 
high with nearly 60% of purchases during the quarter coming from 
customers who are new to Mac. Our year
-
over
-
year sales performance was 
impacted by the different timing of the MacBook Pro launch which did not 
occur until early Q4 this year as opposed to June last year, with the 
subsequent channel fill during the June quarter. Even with a difficult launch 
comparison, we saw great momentum i
n many emerging markets, with 
growth well into double digits and we established new June quarter records 
for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile and Central and Eastern Europe.
 
iPad unit sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter and we gained 
significant 
share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates 
from IDC. We recorded double digit iPad unit growth in both our Greater 
China and rest of Asia Pacific segments with a new June quarter record for 
iPad sales in Mainland China. Almost half of 
iPad purchases in the quarter 
were by customers new to iPad and our active installed base of iPads 
reached a new all
-
time high. Our overall performance compared to last year 
was impacted by the introduction of new iPad Pro models in June of last year 
which
 
resulted in both a different mix with higher ASPs and channel sale a 
year ago.
 
NPD indicates that iPad has 60% share of the U.S. tablet market in the June 
quarter, up from 51% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer 
survey from 451 Research measure
d iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 
94%, and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the 
September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.
 
We continue to make great strides with enterprise customers across multiple 
industries. For example
, financial services institutions are increasingly using 
iPads to deploy digital signature solutions for customer consent, compliance 
requirements, new account openings and services transactions. In the 
railway industry, businesses around the world are usi
ng iPhone and iPad to 
support operations, training, passenger engagement and maintenance 
activities. And leading global automotive companies are deploying iPads in 
dealerships for sales enablement and end
-
to
-
end customer service 
management and are choosing
 
iPhone as the standard mobile device for 
their employees around the world.
 
More and more companies are giving their teams a choice when it comes to 
the devices they use at work and enterprises including Salesforce and 
Capital One are deploying Macs based 
on employee preference. In fact, at 
Salesforce, the majority of their 35,000 employees are using Macs and 
companies tell us that Mac has been instrumental in helping them attract 
and retain talent while providing strong security, streamlined deployment, 
wo
rkflow and significantly lower total cost of ownership.
 
We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our powerful new way for 
organizations to connect with customers. Business Chat lets customers get 
answers to questions, resolve issues and complete 
transactions directly from 
within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or iPad and even 
continue the conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch.
 
DISH Network is making Business Chat available to customers across the 
U.S. to enhance the custome
r service experience for pay TV. Customers can 
instantly reach a live agent with their questions, make account changes, 
schedule an appointment, or order a pay
-
per
-
view movie or sporting event, 
all without leaving the Messages conversation.
 
And Citizens Ba
nk Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies, is testing Business 
Chat with Aramark to handle beverage holders during games. Fans simply 
use their iPhone camera to scan a QR code on the back of their seats taking 
them directly to a Business Chat conversation
 
in Messages. From there, they 
can order drinks, pay quickly and securely with Apple Pay and have them 
delivered directly to their seats without missing a moment of on
-
field play.
 
Our retail and online stores had a great quarter thanks to very strong 
growt
h from iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch and the expansion of 
HomePod to Canada, France and Germany. Our stores hosted more than 
250,000 of our very successful Today at Apple sessions. We continue to add 
content across all Today at Apple topics including pop
ular new sessions on 
music and photography. We opened our 50th retail store in Greater China 
during the quarter and we just opened a beautiful new store in Milan this 
month, bringing the number of stores located outside the U.S. to 46% of the 
total.
 
Let me
 
now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $243.7 
billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $6 billion of debt during 
the quarter, leaving us with $102.6 billion in term debt and $12 billion in 
commercial paper outstanding for a
 
net cash position of $129.1 billion.
 
As we explained in February, we plan to reach a net cash neutral position 
over time. We returned almost $25 billion to investors during the quarter, 
including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents. We repurchased $
20 
billion worth of Apple shares of which $10 billion related to the completion of 
our previous $210 billion buyback program and $10 billion to the beginning 
of the new $100 billion authorization we announced three months ago for a 
total of 112.8 million s
hares repurchased through open market transactions 
during the quarter.
 
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call.
 
We expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion. As you will 
recall, our September quarter results last year included a one
-
time favorable 
adjustment of $640 million to our services revenue. Taking that adjustment 
into account, our revenue guid
ance implies year
-
over
-
year growth of about 
16% to 19%. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We 
expect OpEx to be between $7.95 billion and $8.05 billion. We expect OI&E 
to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 15% bef
ore 
discrete items.
 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per 
share of common stock payable on August 16, 2018 to shareholders of 
record as of August 13, 2018.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'll ask both my questions up front. 
First, for Tim. You're on track to hit your services revenue target even earlier 
than planned, so how are you thin
king about the next legs of services 
growth as you move into the next three to five years?
 
And then for you, Luca, NAND prices are falling this year. Services mix is 
rising. Those should both positively influence gross margins and yet we're 
seeing gross ma
rgin sort of hang out here at 38%. What are the offsetting 
headwinds and is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to 
overpower those headwinds in the next couple of quarters and see gross 
margins drift higher? Thank you.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
A
pple, Inc.
 
Yeah, Katy, thanks for your question. This is Tim. On the services side, we're 
thrilled with the results. They were very broad based. We had double digit 
services growth in all of the geographic segments and the App Store, 
AppleCare, Apple Music
, cloud services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter 
records and of course subscriptions have now passed the 300 million, as I'd 
mentioned before, and so we couldn't be happier with how things are going.
 
In terms of the next leg of this, given the momentum
 
that we're seeing 
across the board, we feel great about our current services, but obviously 
we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as 
well. And so with the combination of these, we feel great about hitting our 
objectives 
and maybe even doing a little better.
 
Luca Maestri

Apple, Inc.
 
Katy, for margins, let me tell you about the puts and takes for the June 
quarter, then I'll talk about the guidance for Q4 and make some general 
observations for the future. Starting with the
 
June quarter, typically we see 
a decline in gross margin going from the March quarter to the June quarter. 
Last year, we were down 40 bps. Two years ago we were down 140 bps. 
This year, we were able to keep GM flat sequentially.
 
During the quarter, we alw
ays have some loss of leverage because of our 
typical seasonality. This year we were able to offset that with some cost 
improvements and also we had some favorability in foreign exchange on a 
sequential basis. Unfortunately, as you know, the U.S. dollar ha
s already 
appreciated again recently, so we do not expect to see that favorability to 
repeat during the September quarter. So those are the puts and takes for 
June and we're very happy to see gross margin sequentially flat for June.
 
For September, we're al
so guiding about flat sequentially at the midpoint. As 
you know, we typically have what we call product transition costs during the 
September quarter, and this year we also have about 30 bps of headwind 
from foreign exchange again because the dollar has ap
preciated recently. 
We expect those two factors to be offset by positive leverage, because 
you've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to services 
that you've actually mentioned during your question. So we feel pretty good 
about also the 
guidance for the fourth quarter.
 
Looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current 
quarter, but I think we have a pretty good record over the last several years 
to make good business decisions, balancing units, revenue and margins. As 
you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the 
last three
-
plus years, but we've been able to manage that.
 
On the memory front, it is true that prices have started to decline. It has 
been a significant headwind for the last 12, 18 
months and still in the June 
quarter was a negative. We believe that we're going to start seeing some 
improvement from here on.

Can we have the next question please? Can we have the next question 
please?
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross 
Research.
 
Shannon S. Cross

Cross Research LLC
 
Thank you very much for taking my 
question. Tim, can you talk a bit about 
trends within your iPhone sales? ASPs were above expectations and now that 
you've had 

 
and that's clearly better than some of the comments from 
some of your competitors. Now that you've had about nine months of 
expe
rience with a high
-
end fully featured phone, can you talk a bit about 
what you think customers want, what the elasticity of demand is and how 
you're sort of thinking about your competitive position? And then I have a 
follow
-
up.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple,
 
Inc.
 
Yeah, Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if 
you look for the cycle, by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an 
average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid single digit and ASP 
growth of double digit. And
 
so if you, and look at iPhone X in particular, it's 
the most innovative smartphone on the market. We priced it at a level that 
represented the value of it and we could not be happier that it has been the 
top selling iPhone since the launch, and so we feel
 
terrific about iPhone X.
 
If you look at the sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the 
iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely, as you can 
probably tell from looking at the ASP and we couldn't be happier with how 
tha
t's gone. And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want 
innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and 
other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe 
with looking at the results.
 
A
t the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year
-
ago quarter 
and so, when we changed some of the configurations, memory 
configurations in the year
-
ago quarter. If you look at it on a geographic 
basis, the top three selling phones in urban C
hina were iPhone, where 
iPhone X was number one and has been for a couple of quarters, and 
iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the U.S., UK and 
Japan. And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's 
happening in the marke
t, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, 
it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share 
in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well.
 
Shannon S. Cross 
-
 
Cross Research LLC
 
Great. Thank you. And then can you
 
talk a bit about China, Greater China up 
19% year
-
over
-
year during the quarter, I believe? Obviously iPhone doing 
well, but some concern that maybe some of what's going on in the trade 
world might have impacted. Doesn't seem like that, so I'm just curious
 
as to 
what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look 
forward. Thank you.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's a good question. Thank you. This is the fourth consecutive quarter 
that we've had double digit growth in Greate
r China. I mentioned how 
iPhone X and the iPhones are selling. We did pick up share in iPhone and 
iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double 
digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product 
category whi
ch the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good 
things happening there.
 
In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back 
because I'm sure some people have questions on this. And our view on 
tariffs is that they show
 
up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting 
in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of 
unintended consequences.
 
That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between 
the U.S. and other major econ
omies are very complex and it's clear that 
several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of 
situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of 
encouraging dialogue and so forth.
 
In terms of the tari
ffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment 
period 

 
I think there's one that's exiting today 

 
there have been three of 
those and maybe I can walk through those briefly just to make sure 
everybody is on the same page.
 
The first was the U.S. impo
sed a tariff on steel and aluminum. That was 
many, many different countries. That started I believe at the beginning of 
June. There have been two other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of 
goods from China that have either been implemented or exi
ting the 
comment period in this month. I think the latest one is today. If you look at 
those three tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs.
 
There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also 
focused on go
ods that are imported from China. That one is out for public 
comment. Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one and we'll 
be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the 
comment period for that one ends.
 
It's actuall
y a tedious process in going through it because you not only have 
to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to 
analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making 
through other companies that are not related t
o revenue. Maybe they're 
related to data centers and this sort of thing and so we're going through that 
now and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back public 
comment.
 
Of course the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue su
ch as 
an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that 
are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. And so that, and we're not 
even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it.
 
All of this said, we're optimistic, as I'
ve been the whole time, that this will 
get sorted out because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. 
and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together, 
that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course 
the world 
needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well. That said, I 
can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get 
through this and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.

And that'll come from Brian White with Monness, Crespi. And Brian your line 
is open. Please go ahead.
 
Brian White

Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.
 
Yes, Tim. I'm wondering if you could talk a litt
le bit about the multi
-
year 
partnership with Oprah Winfrey and what that says about your original 
content strategy and also Apple Music. If you can give us a little more colors 
or an update maybe around paid subscribers or total subscribers around 
Apple Mu
sic and how you feel that's rolled out.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Yeah sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. We're very excited to work with 
Oprah. We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with 
audiences around the world, that t
here's sort of no match and we think that 
we can do some great original content together and so we could not be 
happier in working with Oprah.
 
As you know, we hired two highly respected television executives last year 
and they have been here now for severa
l months and have been working on 
a project that we're not really ready to share all the details of it yet, but I 
couldn't be more excited about what's going on there and we've got great 
talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel 
really 
good about what we will eventually offer.
 
In terms of the sort of the key catalysts and the changes, the cord cutting in 
our view is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster 
rate than is widely thought. We're seeing the thin
gs that we have on the 
periphery of this like Apple TV, units and revenue grew by very strong 
double digits, very, very strong double digits in Q3.
 
As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers 
pick up the Apple TV and use it as 
their box to go to market with their 
subscription service. There are, within the 300 million
-
plus paid 
subscriptions, some of these are third party video subscriptions and we see 
the growth that is going on there. It's like 100% year
-
over
-
year. And so all 
the things from a 

 
all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to 
dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry, and so we're really 
happy to be working on some of them, but we're just not ready to talk about 
it in depth today.
 
In ter
ms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you 
add our paid subscribers and the folks in the trial, and so we're moving 
along at a very, very good rate. It appears to us or in what we've been told 
is that we took the leadership positi
on in North America during the quarter 
and we have the leadership position in Japan, and so in some of the markets 
that we've been in for a long period of time.
 
We're doing quite well, but really, the key thing in music is not the 
competition between compa
nies that are providing music. It's the real 
challenge is to grow the market, because if you add everyone up that's 
providing subscription music today or streaming music, it's, outside of China, 
it's less than 200 million probably around the world. And so 
it does seem to 
me there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market 
well and I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, that will be 
a beneficiary of that as other people will as well. But I like where we are. 
Our reve
nues on Apple Music grew over 50% as I'd mentioned earlier during 
the quarter, and so some really, really strong results. Thanks for the 
question.

Operator
 
Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein has our next question.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca, I'm 
wondering as we think ab
out modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up 
sequentially about 2% to 4%, sort of low single digits. Perhaps you can help 
us think through how we should be thinking about Q4. I know you provided 
some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking ab
out Q3 
ASPs.
 
Luca Maestri 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
Toni, as you know, we do not provide guidance for either units or ASPs for 
any product category, but of course we provided guidance on revenue and 
that the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%. We expect the 
g
rowth to come from strong growth from iPhone, from services and from 
wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course of the year.
 
On iPhone ASP, the only thing that I would point out is that obviously we're 
exiting the June quarter at a si
gnificantly higher level than in the past and so 
that I think is important to keep in mind as we move into the September 
quarter. It's important to keep in mind the type of revenue growth that 
we've implied in our guidance.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford 
C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Thank you. Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit 
about the health of the smartphone market. Apple's smartphone iPhone 
units have been relatively flat for four years and I think you've probably 
been a share
 
gainer during the period which would suggest at least at the 
high end of the market, that it's perhaps flat
-
to
-
down and I'm wondering if 
you can comment on, A, whether you believe that and what you think might 
be happening with replacement cycles. And spe
cifically, also what impact if 
any you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement 
batteries for iPhones.
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I think the smartphone market is very healthy. I think it's actually the best 
market in the world
 
to be in for someone that is in the business that we're 
in. It's an enormous sized market and whether it grows, from our point of 
view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 
2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. And so th
at's kind of the way 
that I view that.
 
iPhone revenues are up 20% for the quarter over last year. We're really 
pleased with that and if you look at the sort of the cycle, which I'll define as 
Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid single
 
digits and 
on an average weekly sales point of view, and of course double digit on the 
ASP and so I think it's really healthy.
 
In terms of replacement cycles, as I'd mentioned I think on a previous call, 
some replacement cycles are lengthening. I think th
at the major catalyst for 
that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of 
total sales around the world than they were at one time and so I think that 
some are lengthening.
 
And, but I think for us, the thing that we always have to 
do is come out with 
a really great innovative product, and I think that iPhone X shows that when 
you deliver a great innovative product, there's enough people there that 
would like that and it can be a really good business, and so that's how to 
look at tha
t.
 
In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us as it 
is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew 
double digits over last year during the quarter and so we're thrilled with that 
and you can se
e that carrying through to the services line and the growth 
that we had there.
 
In terms of batteries, we have never done an analysis internally about how 
many people decided to get a lower
-
priced battery than buy another phone 
because it was never about th
at for us. It was always about doing something 
great for the user and I think if you treat the users and the customers well, 
then you have a good business over time and so that's how we'd look at 
that.

Great. Okay. Super. So I'd like to focus on product roadmap and strategy. 
There is a war going on for the home, the connected home, over the 
Internet of 
Things. And with two products, the HomePod and Apple TV in the 
home, my question is strategically, how do you feel about the importance of 
being in the home and whether it threatens your dominance outside the 
home with your core business in the mobile devi
ces if you sort of lose that 
battle? I'm just trying to figure out strategically when you think about where 
the puck is going, how important is it for you to have a beachhead in the 
home as well as out of home?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
I think the
 
home business, Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. 
They're both important products clearly, but everybody has their iPhone at 
home as well and everybody has their Mac at home and everyone has their 
iPad at home. And so in terms of the Siri acc
ess point, as you can tell from 
the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary 
amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home
-
related 
functions.
 
I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on
 
and 
so forth. Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch 
and the iPhone and the iPad, and so I think home is important. Home is 
important. Work is important. The movement between the two are 
important. Health is important. So the sm
artphone has become the 
repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just 
meant for a portion of it and so I think all of those are important and we're 
focused on all of them.
 
Laura Martin

ul, actually. Okay.
 
Timothy Donald Cook

Apple, Inc.
 
Thanks for your question.
 
Laura Martin 
-
 
Needham & Co. LLC
 
Yeah. Sort of. I mean I'll watch your product roadmap and be able to tell 
what the answer is. The other thing, the thing I get in fights with i
nvestors 
about the most is this and I'd love your insight on this. I love the expansion 
of the new products. The question I have is are they actually on
-
ramps into 
the Apple ecosystem, the Beats, the Watch, the AirPods, subscriptions, are 
they on
-
ramps int
o the ecosystem or is the on
-
ramp to the ecosystem the 
iPhone and then these new products add revenue per member once you get 
somebody into the ecosystem via the iPhone?
 
Timothy Donald Cook 
-
 
Apple, Inc.
 
A lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the 
whole ecosystem, even 
though they might not currently use all the different products. And so the 
way that I think about those products are they're products within the 
ecosystem itself. And there's the AirPods have really gone through the roof 
and the Apple
 
Watch has hit an air pocket and has gone to a whole different 
level as I'd mentioned earlier with our overall wearables revenue. And so in 
my view, this is a part of the 

 
they are a core part of the ecosystem.

But do they attract people to the ecosystem or does the person have to have 
an iPhone first?

It is, well, but on your point though, it is clear from communications I've had 
with user
s that some of them were attracted to iPhone because of the Apple 
Watch.

Oh, I see.

So the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone. The reverse of that is also true, 
is that somebody got the 
iPhone and then decided I really want something to 
coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth 
like the watch does so well and so it's not always a linear path. I see these 
things as being somewhat fluid and different for each
 
user.

So they're complementary and self

reinforcing? Okay. That makes sense. All 
right. Thanks very much.

he question.

Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report the 
results of our fourth fiscal quar
ter. We established a new September quarter 
records for iPhone, iPad and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest 
September quarter revenue and earnings ever.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $36 billion, representing year
-
over
-
year growth 
of 27%. That's a $7.7 b

results and was driven primarily by strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales.
 
Operating margin was $10.9 billion, representing 30.4% of revenue. Net 
income was $8.2 billion, increasing 24% over the prior Sep
tember quarter's 
result. The quarter's net income translated to diluted earnings per share of 
$8.67.
 
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products 
and services. We sold over 4.9 million Macs establishing a new September 
qua
rter record. This represents 1% growth year
-
over
-
year compared to 
IDC's latest published estimate of 8% contraction of the global personal 
computer market in the September quarter.
 
Portable sales grew 9% year
-
over
-

Earlier this week we unveiled the stunning new design for iMac that packed 
high performance technology and a brilliant new display with reduced 
reflection into an incredibly sleek a
luminum and glass enclosure. We also 
introduced an even thinner and lighter version of our most popular Mac, the 
13

inch MacBook Pro, featuring a retina display with over 4 million pixels in 
all flash storage. We began and ended the quarter with between th
ree and 
four weeks of Mac channel inventory which is below our target range of four 
to five weeks.
 
Moving to our music products, we sold 5.3 million iPods compared to 6.6 
million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch continue to account for over half 
of all 
iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 
70% in the September quarter based on the latest data published by MPD 
and iPod continue to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track 
based on the latest data published by GF

The iTunes Store generated all time record results, with revenue almost $2.1 
billion thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and video. We look 
forward to launching the new iTunes featuring the completely redesigned 
pla

The new iTunes has a dramatically simpler and clearner interface, so 

computers are conveniently displayed in 
their iTunes library and are

Recognized revenue from iPhone handsets and accessories sales was $17.1

increase of 56%. Businesses around the world con
tinue to make iPhone, an

Turning to iPad, we w
ere very pleased with sales of 14 million iPads during 
the September quarter compared to 11.1 million in the year ago quarter and 
the increase of 26%. iPad sales were ahead of our expectations and we saw 
a strong year
-
over
-
year growth in iPad sales in ever
y geographic region.
 
Earlier this week, we introduced the iPad Mini, the thinnest, lightest, 

capability, customers have come to expect from an iPad and you can hold it 
in one hand. We al
so introduced the fourth generation iPad with the 
beautiful 9.7
-
inch Retina display, an A6 chip with twice the performance of 
the iPad we announced earlier this year.
 
Together with the iPad 2, these two new iPads run more than 275,000 apps 
in the App Store
. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad 
accessories during the quarter was 7.5 billion compared to 6.9 billion in the 
year
-
ago quarter and the increase of 9%. we ended the quarter with about 
3.4 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential inc
rease of about 
200,000, which left as just over our four weeks of iPad channel inventories, 
target on a look
-
back basis.
 
iPad is fundamentally changing work processes across industries around the 
world. With apps developed in
-
house, iPad is helping compani
es deliver 
better service; streamline manufacturing and then power workforces with 
critical data and information.
 
Volkswagen has developed more than 30 in
-
house apps for vital processes 
across the company including monitoring and tracking of vehicles on th
e 
production line, scheduling the vehicle transportation at assembly plants and 
greeting customers when they pick up new cars. Ping An Insurance in China 
has deployed thousands of iPads to their sales agents and service teams.
 
Apps developed in
-
house are u
sed by car accident inspectors to carry out 
onsite inspections involve claims, which significantly shortens processing 
time and improves customer satisfaction. In Brazil, Banco Bradesco is using 
iPads to redefine the customer experience in their bank branc
hes. Beyond 
completing customer transaction, employees use iPad to inform and educate 
customers about bank services, and Bradesco apps in the App Store.
 
Combining iPhones, iPads and iPod touch, we sold over 44 million iOS 
devices in the September 
quarter. The App Store now offers more than 
700,000 apps, including over 275,000 apps specifically for iPad. We 
established a new all
-
time record for quarterly app sales in the September 
quarter, and we were very pleased to report that we have reached $6.5
 
billion in cumulative payments to developers. Customers are embracing iPad 
in growing numbers. With over 190 million account sign ups in the first year 
of the service.
 
With iCloud, customers can access their music, photos, calendars, contacts, 
documents a
nd more from whatever device they are using. And it is built 
into every new iOS device and every new Mac. And we launched iOS6 last 

new features, including broader language suppor
t for Siri, Facebook 

improvements in maps over the past month, and we will work non
-
stop until 
maps lives up to our incredibly high standards.
 
I would now like to turn to the Apple retail s
tores. Revenue was $4.2 billion, 
which is a new September quarter record and an increase of 18% over the 
year
-

launch ever. The stores also established a new quarterly record for Mac 
sales,
 
selling just over 1.1 million Macs. We opened a total of 18 new stores 
in 10 countries during the quarter, including our first store in Sweden. We 
also opened our second store at Hong Kong, at Festival Walk overwhelming 
response, resulting in our biggest 
store opening of the year.
 
We exited the quarter with 390 stores, 140 of which are outside the United 
States. With an average of 376 stores open, average revenue per store was 
$11.2 million, compared to $10.7 million in the year
-
ago quarter. Segment 
margin
 
was $848 million, compared to $652 million in the year
-
ago quarter. 
We hosted 94 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 
77.5 million visitors in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 22%. That 
translates to an average of 19,000 visi
tors per store, per week.
 
Total company gross margin was 40%, which was 150 basis points higher 
than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better than 
expected, commodity and other costs. Another quarterly difference was due 
to leverage on th
e higher
-
than
-
expected sales and more favorable foreign 
exchange. The remainder was due to some items that we do not expect to 
recur in the December quarter.
 
Operating expenses were $3.5 billion, and included $379 million of stock
-
based compensation expens
e. OI&E was a net expense to $51 million. The 
interest income and investment gains were more than offset by higher
-
than
-
expected currency hedging expense. Under the accounting rules, foreign 
exchange fluctuations late in the quarter required us to accelera
te 
recognition of premium expense related to Q1 and Q2 hedges. This will 
result in less premium expense being recognized in Q1 and Q2 the tax rate 
for the quarter was 24.5%, bringing us to a tax rate for the full fiscal year of 
25.2%.
 
Turning to cash, our 
cash for short
-
term and long
-
term marketable 
securities totaled $121.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, 
compared to $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential 
increase of over $4 billion. The increase in cash was net of $2.5 bi
llion of 
dividend paid in August. About $83 billion of our total cash was offshore at 
the end of the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $9.1 
billion. Our board of directors have declared a dividend of $2.65 per common 
share, payable on Novemb
er 15, 2012. The shareholders of recorded as of 
the close of business on November 12, 2012.
 
In August, we entered into a rule 10b5
-
1 compliant accelerated share 
repurchase program, with the financial institution to purchase out the $2 
billion of Apple stoc

 
In addition to shares purchased through the accelerated share repurchase 
program, we may also purchase shares in open market transaction in 
compliance with our applicable securities laws. As we move ahead into the

looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the 
call. As a reminder, year

year comparison will be impacted by the fact 
that our December quarter this year will sp

December quarter last year included a 14

As we indicated previously, revenue in that 14

3 billion in the December quarter last 
year. We expect gross margin to be about 36% reflecting approximately $90 
million related to stock

based compensation expense.
 
We expect OpEx to be about $4.05 billion including about $485 million 
related to stock
-
bas
ed compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about 
$380 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. We are targeting 
EPS of about $11.75.
 

We generated revenue of over $156
 
billion, which is up 45% year
-
over

year, 
and reflects growth of $48 billion in revenue. We sold over $200 million iOS 
devices including 125 million iPhones reflecting 73% growth year

and 58 million iPads reflecting 80% growth.
 
We sold a record 
$18 million Macs and shipped 35 million iPods. And we 
expanded the reach of iTunes music stores to 63 countries around the world. 
We launched stunning new versions of OS X and iOS, and time it altogether; 
we launched iPod with customers reaching over 190 m

And finally, we generated net income of $41.7 billion, an increase of 61%

lineup ever and remain very confident in our new product pipeline.

(Operator Instructions) Your first quest
ion will come from Katy Huberty with 
Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty 

 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. If your guidance comes to fruition, December 
will be the first quarter in a very long time, but Apple EPS declined year
-
on
-
year despit

history over the past two months, the [bares] will point out that may be the 

curious how you would respond to that? And 
then as a follow
-
up, Peter if you 

-
tick in 
December given you should have decent iPhone mix? Thank you.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

d 
then Tim can add a few points. The change year
-
over
-
year is being driven by 
a couple of things, so first of all, last year included a 14
th
 

Q1 is a normal 13
-
week quarter. That along with a stronger U.S. dollar, and 
the change in gross m
argin, so let me talk to you about what we see for 

but not year
-
over
-
year.
 

We have an unprecedente
d number of new product introductions over the 
last six weeks, and this has led to record levels of demand. New or re
-
priced 
versions of our products announced during this time frame represent over 
80% of the total expected December quarter revenue.
 
But th
ere are costs associated with such dramatic change and demand. The 
iPhone 5, iPad Mini, iMac, MacBook Pro 13
-
inch, iPod Touch and iPod Nano 

before introduced so many new form factors
 
at once. All of these products 
have higher costs than their predecessors, and therefore lower gross 
margins as they are at the height of the cost curve.
 
This has been the case with new products in the past, so nothing new. The 
difference this time is the 
sheer number of new products we are introducing 
in a very short period of time. Additionally, we lowered the price of the 
iPhone 4S and iPhone 4, delivering incredible value to our customer.
 
We head into this holiday quarter with the strongest iPhone line
-
up that we 
have ever had with the iPhone 4 starting at three in the subsidized markets. 
We also added the iPad Mini to our iPad line
-
up. The iPad Mini has the full 
iPad experience, and we priced it aggressively at $329, delivering incredible 
value to our c
ustomers. Its gross margin is significantly below the corporate 
average.
 
So in summary, we expect our gross margin to decline by about 400 basis 
points sequentially. We expect the benefit from positive leverage on a 
sequentially higher revenue and a 
greater mix of iPhone, but we expect 
these benefits will be more than offset by a number of factors.
 
First, margins on new products are lower than their predecessors including 

lower
ed the price of the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4. Third, we will 
experience transitionary cost associated with multiple new product ramp. 
Fourth, the high anticipated volume of iPhone and other new products will 
generate significantly greater deferred revenu
e sequentially.
 
As you are aware, we defer a portion of our revenue with every device we 
sell, and amortize it back into revenue over the life of the device. In periods 
of exceptionally strong sales like the December quarter, the deferred 
amounts are signi
ficantly higher than the revenue amortized in from past 
sales. And fifth, the favorable items that benefited the gross margin in the 
September quarter are not expected to repeat in the December quarter.
 
We will work hard to try and get down the cost curves
 
and improve our 
manufacturing and other efficiencies as we successfully have done in the 
past. We ended this holiday season with our strongest product line
-
up ever, 
and we have great choices for customers. To be in a position to anticipate 
over $50 billio
n of demand for our products in a single quarter is a reflection 
of the incredible strength of our products and our business.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
And Katy, if I could just add a couple of things to that. We are dedicated to 
making the very best products in the
 
world, and we think about the smallest 
of details, and we are unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best 

innovation and excellence is the reason that our customers choose buy our 
pr
oducts, and this will always be the driving force behind Apple. We are 
managing the company for the long
-
run and will continue to make great 
long
-
term decision. We remain very, very confident in our strategy, and will 
use our world
-
class skills and hardwar
e, software and services to delight our 
customers.

supply ramp for the iPhone 5 in the holiday quarter? And how does some of

hes?

terms of the production, our output has improved significantly since earlier

quite a few iPhones.

Toni M. Saccon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. I just wanted to first follow
-
up on that previous question 
around the ramp of iPhone. Do you continue to anticipate rolling out to all 
100 countries this quarter as you had announced at the time of the 
iPhone 5 
announcement. And related to that can you comment on whether the supply 

goods sold relative. So as your supply improves, do you actually expect your 
cost of goods sold to decl
ine?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

rolling out to the 100 countries as we announced before, it is our fastest 
rollout ever; there will be some large countries in month of December. But 
we 
anticipate still achieving the 100. In terms of costs, with each new 
product we see learning curves associated with ramping production.
 
And the new products we have now are no exception to that, the difference 
is the number of new products that we having m
oving in line. As Peter said, 

months, this is the most prolific period in our history in terms of the new 
product introduction and innovation; the past six weeks have been 
phenomenal in te
rms of new product introduction.
 

see those costs accelerating on a per unit basis. As we got through the 
quarter, I see it very much being a production ramp across many, many ne
w 
products.
 
Toni M. Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay, thank you for that color. If I could just follow
-

about how you believe that the iPad will be, and the tablet market will be an 
enormous market, bigger than 

to expand that market and make it more accessible by introducing the iPad 

tablets going forward that would address different needs in t
he marketplace, 

about the iPad market being bigger than the PC market going forward, do 
you see larger form factors in the marketplace evolving, and I guess the 
question, is why not?
 
Tim
othy D. Cook
 

roadmaps etcetera. But let me make some comments on your question. We 
continue to be very confident that the tablet market will surpass the PC 
market, there is incredible d
evelopment in both ecosystems and product 
going on in the tablet space. It is already extremely compelling for many, 
many customers to choose the tablet, in particular an iPad over a PC. And 
when you look at the size of the PC market, there is an enormous 
opportunity for Apple there. Pretty much each quarter you see 80 to 90 
million PCs being sold.
 
And so we do think that the iPad and the iPad Mini, and the iPad 2 will all be 
extremely attractive offering for people in lieu of PC. And we are going to 
contin
ue to very much focus on the future of iPad, and we are very, very 
confident with what we have in the pipeline. And we are extremely pleased 

selling the very first unit.

Thank you very much. Tim or Peter could y
ou talk a little bit about China, 


an economic standpoint?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

ms of what we saw in China for Q4, revenue 

-
on
-
year, Mac was up extremely strong, 
up 44%. As you recall, we launched portables for the first time in July or the 
portables that we have previously announced in U.S. in June
, we announced 
that in China in July. iPad was up 45% in Greater China, iPhone was up 
38%. And so all in all, a fantastic quarter that brings us to a full year fiscal 
year revenue number of $23.8 billion for China which is really phenomenal, 
when you think
 

-
on
-
year up 78% and 
Greater China now represents about 15% of Apple for the fiscal year and so 

his opening remarks, we are continuing to inv
est in our own retail stores 
there, we continue to expand distribution in with channel partners as well, 
and we continue to see it as a extremely exciting market with more and 
more people wanting Apple product.

Great, 
and then I just had a follow

up question on the Tablet market, with 
the launch of Surface today and obviously the Win 8 Tablet of Mac, could 
you talk a little bit about what are you seeing, from a competitive standpoint 
and how you think about it? Thank yo
u.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 


think one of the toughest things you do with deciding which product is to 
make hard tra

done that with the iPad, and so the user experience is absolutely incredible, 

would do all of those things very well, a
nd so I think people when they look 
at the iPad versus competitive offerings are going to conclude, they really 
want an iPad and I think people have done that to

date and I think they will 
continue to do that.

Thanks a lot, appreciate it. Can you just go through a little bit more on 
tablets, the iPad Mini, how do you think that will sell versus the original iPad 
form factor and how do you want to differentiate that is there more of an 
eBook focus with and educat
ion focus with the Mini and do you think it will 
sell more than the regular or the original iPad and how do you want us to 
just think about the cannibalization factor as well of the older product or the 
older form factor?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

ve an old product, then we have only new product, we just 

 
Benjamin Reitzes 

 
Barclays Capital
 

 
Timothy D. Cook
 
So, no, but the way that we look at 
this is that we provide a fantastic iPad 
Touch, we provide an incredible fourth generation iPad and iPad Mini and 
then iPad 2. Customers will decide which one or two or three or all four that 

 
years not 

do that than somebody else to do it and the far, far bigger opportunity here 

still over 
300 million PCs being bought per year, and I think a great number 

a much bigger opportunity for Apple, and so instead of being focused on 
cannibalizing ourselves, and I look at it 


 
Benjamin Reitzes 

 
Barclays Capital
 
Okay, and then just my quick follow
-

about your hobby in [Vaio] how many did you sell in
 

the strategy there for the living room to
-

answer or not an answer?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Or not you might guess, for Q4 we sold 1.3 million that is up over a 100% 
year
-
on
-
year that means that we sold up more than 5 million Apple TVs 
during the fiscal year, which is almost double the previous year, we have 
sold 2.8 the previous year and so the 
business continues to do very well, but 
if you look at the size of revenue of this business versus our other 


eve there 
is something more there and continue to pull the string to see where it takes 
us.

l hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
 
Charles Eugene Munster 

 
Piper Jaffray
 
Hey good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPad we saw a 
deceleration in September quarter. Was there anything in particular that 
might have been, as do y
ou think about that business might have been 
driving that?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
The June to September was 17 million to 14 million Gene and the first thing 
to know there is that as we had talked about in the July call, the June 
quarter contained 1.2 million inc
rease in channel inventory and so the actual 
sell through sequentially looks, the comparison looks very different than the 
our reported sell in numbers do, the second thing is that the $14 million 
exceeded what we had expected to do in iPad and the reason 
we had 
expected it to decline is that we believe based on the two or three years of 

the September quarter versus the June quarter, a part of this reason is 
because K
-
12 heavily b
uys in the June quarter, K
-

in the September quarter, it becomes the Higher Ed kind of move and Higher 
Ed is still buying notebooks for the most part, and so there is some kind of 

nnounced the new 
product in March and have an enormous full quarter of demand in the June 
quarter and then when you compare that to the September quarter there 
would be natural phase down.
 

d purchases 
of tablets due to new product rumors and this intensified in August and 

occur. But it did occur.
 

-
over
-
year basis because of the year ago quarter having also a channel 
inventory build as we stock the channel to the profit level the sell through 
year
-
over
-
year actually grew 44% and so the underlying sell through was 
extremely strong.
 
And so we continue to f
eel great about how iPad has done and with 
announcing the fourth generation iPads just as we and adding iPad Mini to 

 
Charles Eugene Munster 

 
Piper Jaffray
 
Okay, great, thank you, and then
 
my follow
-

seeing in margins that some of these products get more expensive to 
produce to be competitive, would you be open to passing some of those cost 

ts 
and maintain a lot of those price points?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

the product and the prices and as you know our customary practice, long
-
standing customary practice is just to 
guide for the current quarter, and so I 
would want to talk about what we might do post that.

Yeah, thank you, good afternoon. Peter or Tim my first question is around 
the sequential guidance for revenue of around 44% quarter

quarter for 
December. Can you provide
 
us some context about how we should think 
about the iPad and the iPhone families in particular? How their revenue 
growth could [down tail] of that 44%?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

to re
mind everybody that if you are looking at this year
-
over

comparing the sequential year
-
over

th
 
week, 
last year in Q1, you need to adjust for that. And I think it would give you a 
different answer, if you were compari
ng anything year
-
over

Specifically, your question about iPhone and iPad sequentially, we have just 
announced amazing new products in both lineups and we expect large

as a result,
 

revenue.

countries and have supply constraints, impacting all 100 countries first and 
then go back and back still all those different outlets or will there be certain 
markets where you decide to kind of reach the supply
-
demand equilibrium 
first, and then keep 
similar sort of 100 countries kind of at constrained 

of (inaudible)
 
first sprinkle the product everywhere and then back the later 
or will it be more targeted?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Wh
at we did initially Mark, as we planned the first 30 to 40 countries prior to 
introducing the product and roll those out across at September in two 
different dates. The balance of the quarter, we planned with an eye toward 
the supply and what we think the 
demand will be. But we do plan these in 
advance and so it is not a précised science. And we obviously have to plan 
those with several weeks of notice. And so occasionally, it can be different 
than what we think.

Thank you very much. Regarding the iPad, you said that you pric
ed it very 
aggressively. I think many people on The Street seem to have a slightly 
different view. Could you maybe talk a little about your pricing philosophy? 
And was it driven by cost? Or is it just more to keep up a premium brand, 
given the quality of y
our products?

the bill to small cheap tablet, we set out the bill to smaller iPad that offers 
the full iPad experience as our customers would expect. As a 
result, the 
difference between the iPad Mini and the competition is profound, our iPad 
Mini begins with a 7.9 inch display, which is 35% larger than 7 inch tablets, 

FaceTime HD front and
 
a 5 megapixel of 1080p iSight rear camera versus 
typically a one from our competition. We are shipping our fastest 
communications with dual
-
band Wi
-
Fi and have included the A5 chip, which 
has higher performance than our competitors. And finally, the fit a
nd finish 
of our precision, unibody aluminum closure is breathtaking when held in 
your hands.
 


higher cost c

going to work to try and get down the cost curves and be more efficient in 
manufacturing as we have been in the past with our other products.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Steve, one of the things we try to 
do is to create a product that people will 
love for months and years after they purchase it and continue using it in a 

really see that more broadly on iPad by looking at the usage st
atistics, as I 
had mentioned earlier this week, over 90% of the web traffic from tablets 
are from iPad. And so, Apple will not make a product that somebody may 

they get it home, the

not a kind of experience we want our customers to have. And I think when 
you 

 

using anything other than maybe another iPad or so
mething after you do 
that.

I look forward to it. could you comment on your enterprise opportunity or 
obviously a lot of its BYOD, but you have many retailers, you have a 
corporate director to use iPads and so forth.
 
are you doing anything a little 
bit more aggressive to support that market particularly with the Windows 
pads now coming out?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
We now have almost all of the Fortune 500 that are testing or deploying iPad 
and I think with the recent announce
ments, the penetration will only grow. 

numbers now are above 80% on both iPhone and iPad. And so I feel like we 

ling 
pretty good about it.

Hey, thanks, good afternoon. Tim, maybe comment on the component 
environment a little bit particularly, related to the iPad, iPad Mini and iPhone 

launching. And then Peter, 
the quick one for you, the volatility on the OI&E 
line. is that just the calendar third quarter and calendar fourth quarter issue, 
and then it normalizes or is that going to continue? Thanks.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 



the guidance. I think we saw some challenges there and feel good about our 

the fu

shipping the 21.5
-
inch iMac in November and the 27
-
inch in December. And 
so there will be a short amount of time during the quarter to manufacturer 
and ramp those and I expect the demand
 
to be robust. So we will have a 
significant shortage there. the others are more based on how big is big from 
a demand point of view and that is very difficult to predict, but you can tell 

e that 
Peter talked about earlier. Hopefully that answers your question.

while interest income was above what we 
expected, foreign exchange hedging expense was higher than we expected 
relative to our guidance. without getting overly detailed, dollar weakness 
late in the quarter and accounting rules required us to accelerate and
 
recognize a large amount of foreign exchange premium expense related to 
future quarter hedges in the current quarter. All things being equal, 
premium expense in Q1 should be lower. This has been factored into our 
December OI&E guidance of $380 million.

Great, thanks guys. If you look at the iPhone, unit growth versus the 


started to breakdown slightly over
 
the past couple of quarters in fact, this 
most recent quarter, it looks like revenues grew three times faster than the 
unit growth. So I guess the question is, is this just simply the market 
migrating down to the sort of low

end of this skew stack or just
 
less 
accessories from an attached or dollar spent in that and a quick follow up.

were relatively flat in the September quarter, year
-
on
-
year and were up 
slight
ly on a sequential basis. The iPad ASPs were down year
-
over
-
year in a 
low double
-
digit way, but this really was reflective of our price reduction on 
the iPad 2 the stronger dollar and a little bit of change in mix and that's 
what drove the ASP change year
-
over
-
year on a sequential basis. iPad ASPs 
were actually pretty flat.
 
Brian Marshall

Great thanks, and then a quick follow
-
up is, looks like this is the second 
quarter in a row that the United States iPhone activations is actually growing 
faste
r than the international market that kind of seems like a strange 
dynamic considering the magnitude of the turn of the international being 
order magnitude larger than the U.S., one of you could comment on that, 
thanks.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
I think it's import
ant to remember there that we launched iPhone 5 in the 
U.S. during the quarter and where we launched in some international 
countries the bulk of the world we did not launch it yet and so I would have 
expected to have seen a more significant growth in the U
.S. versus the rest 
of the world.

Hi thank you. A

China occur in the December quarter?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Keith, it's Tim. Yes we project that it will occur in December.
 
Keith Bachman 

 
BMO Capital Markets
 
Okay thanks and the clarification on top o
f that, did you comment that you 
think you'll be able to meet supply of iPhone's at the end of the December 
quarter or do you think that you will end the quarter with backlogs of iPhone 
5, or iPhones I should just say it's as a product's category?
 
Timothy 
D. Cook
 
I'm actually not projecting whether supply and demand will balance for the 
quarter, I'm saying that I feel great about where we are on the 
manufacturing ramp that our supply output is significantly higher than it was 
earlier in October, and I'm con
fident that we'll be able to supply quite a few 
during the quarter, but in terms of where that, when that balance occurs, I 
can't tell at this point.

Thanks very much. Tim I wanted to go back to the iPad one more time if I 
could, specifically I wanted to ask or try to give us a feel for your view 
around the emerging model in the tablets base where vendors are willing to 
subsidize their hardware with con
tent or search, where many of these 
vendors are selling hardware that break
-
even or even a loss and hoping they 
make it up on the back end, how is that impacting your iPad business if at all 
and is that something Apple would consider going forward?
 
Timothy
 
D. Cook
 
We've seen low
-
cost challenges before and iPad continues to beat every 
other tablet on the market, it can be any price and so we think customers 
are very smart, we think they have very high expectations, we think that 
they want a device that can d
o more and we are confident that our focus on 
making the best product is what will win at the end of the day and so we will 
stay true to that.
 
Chris K. Whitmore 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities
 
Okay and then my second question I wanted to ask about the supply, i
t 
sounds like you've made a lot of changes to your supplier list as these new 
products are ramping perhaps due to strategic reasons and is that creating 
an added layer of complexity as you try to ramp these new products and to 
what extent is that contribut
ing perhaps to the higher cost structure of these 
products?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
I'm not sure what you're trying to get out there, but I would not say that 
there has been a significant change in our supplier partners. There is always 
some change obviously, but 
I wouldn't describe any change as significant 

your specific question.

Thanks. My first question, I guess is for Tim. Just in terms on the iPad Mini,
 
there has obviously been a fair amount of debate within Apple over the 
years whether to even do the smaller screen iPad. And I guess, can you just 

time for that now is right, or w
as the technology is right? Just any insight 
there will be helpful. And then for Peter, my question is on gross margin 

 
when we revisit it
 
slightly in the sense that you guys have spoken 
about various higher cost structures before as well in the loop
 
from I think 
the 3G as to the fall in the iPhone. And even when the iPad I think was 

Apple
 
building
,
 
tighter revenues are getting to the component we use
 
as
,
 
do 
you
 
actually very quickly got thr
ough these potential gross margin dips. Is 
anything scripturally different this time around many things?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

referencing are comments that Steve had made before about 7
-
inch tabl
et. 
And let me be clear, we would not make one of the 7
-



-
inches, but for many reasons. One of the reasons however, is 
size,
 
and
 
so I am not sure if you 
saw our keynote. But the difference in just 
the realistic size between the 7.9, almost 8 versus 7 is 35%. And when you 

And also, the iPad Mini has the same number of pixels as iPad
 
2 does.
 
And so you have access to all 275,000 apps that are in our App Store that 
have been custom
-
designed to take advantage of the four (inaudible). And 

7
-

in our whole different leap.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Kulbinder, the sequential declining in gross margin that we see in the 
December quarter is largely being driven by many new form factor changes 

detail. And we believe that over 80% of 
the revenue that we will see in the 

last six weeks. And so while having lower gross margins on a new product is 

a 
sheer
 



to make a lot of these products to g

as we can. But we are often going to work to try and get down the cost 
curves and improve manufacturing and other efficiencies as we have 

work

record for iPad unit sales and 
new June quarter records for iPhone and Mac unit sales, leading to our 
highest June quarter revenue and earnings ever.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $35 billion, representing year

of 23%. The $6.5 billion incre

driven primarily by strong growth in iPad and iPhone sales.
 
Operating margin was $11.6 billion, representing 33% of revenue. Net

and services. We sold 4 million Macs establishing a new June quarter record. 
This represents 2% growth y
ear
-
over
-
year, compared to IDCs latest 
published estimate of 1% contraction of the global personal computer 
market in the June quarter.
 
Last month, we updated the entire MacBook lines with faster processors, 
graphics, memory, flash storage and USB 3.0 conn
ectivity. We also 
introduced the all
-
new 15 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display, all flash 
architecture and quad core processors and customer response has been 
excellent.
 

discuss la
ter, we also experienced our best quarter ever for U.S. education 
institution Mac sales with Portables representing nearly three quarters of 
total Mac sales.
 
Notable large education transaction closed during the June quarter, include 
Rutherford County, Nor
th Carolina, which has purchased 6,000 MacBook Airs 
to support its 21
st
 
Century Digital Learning Environment, and Pueblo 
Colorado School District 70 were all high school students and K
-
12 staff in 
the 22 School District will convert to MacBook Air. We bega
n and ended the 
quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory, which 
is below our target range of four to five weeks.
 
Tomorrow, we will release Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of OS X. 
Mountain Lion introduces more than 200 feat
ures including all
-
new 
messages app, notification center, system wide sharing, and Facebook 
integration. We built iCloud into the foundation of Mountain Lion, making it 
easier than ever for customers to keep content up
-
to
-
date across all their 
devices.
 
Mov
ing to our music products, we sold 6.8 million iPods compared to 7.5 
million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our 
expectation and iPod Touch continue to account for over half of all iPod sold. 
iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 pl
ayers remained at over 70% based 
on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod continue to be the top 
selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data 
published by GfK.
 
We ended the quarter within our target range of four to si
x weeks of iPod 
channel inventory. The iTunes Store generated very strong results in the 
quarter with revenue of over 1.8 billion, thanks to continued strong sales of 
music, apps and other content. We are pleased to launch the iTunes Store in 
12 countries 
including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan last month. 
Customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download 
from iTunes.
 

January, there have been over 40 millio
n downloads of the iTunes U app. 
Over 700 new K
-
12 schools and districts and over 125 colleges and 
universities have enrolled in the iTunes U program, while over 750 new 
courses have been published.
 

s compared to 20.3 
million in the previous June quarter; that represents 28% year
-
over
-
year 
growth and was ahead of the amount we factored into our guidance 
following very strong sales in channel inventory build we achieved in the 
March quarter. We added s
everal small regional carriers during the quarter 
and now have iPhone distribution through over 250 carriers in over 100 
countries.
 
We ended the quarter with about 8.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a 
sequential decline of about 300,000 iPhones, and
 
we remained within our 
target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized 
revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $16.2 billion during 
the quarter compared to $13.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 
22%.
 
En
terprises across the globe continue to choose iPhone as the standard 
device for their employees. We estimate that the number of iPhones in the 
Fortune 500 has more than doubled in the past year. iPhone is helping 
businesses and employees to be more product
ive wherever they are.
 
PepsiCo has deployed thousands of iPhones with an in
-
house app build 
specifically for their field merchandisers. This app has eliminated paper 
reports and provides real
-
time information to managers, sales teams and 
delivery drivers.
 
German insurance provider ERGO has built an in
-
house app for iPhone that 
thousands of agents use to process insurance claims, which has significantly 
reduced paper work and improved processing time and customer 
satisfaction.
 
Turning to iPad, we were thrill
ed with sales of over 17 million iPads during 
the June quarter compared to 9.2 million in the year ago quarter, an 
increase of 84%. We saw very strong year
-
over
-
year growth in iPad sales 
around the world and are pleased to be selling iPad in 97 countries.
 
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the 
quarter was $9.2 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the year ago quarter, an 
increase of 52%. We ended the quarter with about 3.2 million iPads in 
channel inventory, a sequential increa
se of about 1.2 million units, which left 
us just within our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel 
inventory.
 
The iPad continues to be a great success in the U.S. education market, with 
sales setting a new quarterly record and nearly doubling y
ear
-
over
-
year to 
just under 1 million iPads. While interest in the new iPad was high, sales of 
the reduced price iPad 2 in the K
-
12 market were particularly strong. And 
even though, as I mentioned earlier, we achieved all time record Mac sales 
to U.S. educ
ation institutions during the quarter. We sold more than twice as 
many iPads as Macs to U.S. education institutions. We are extremely pleased 
with these results.
 
One great example of iPad adoption in education is the Mansfield Texas 
Independent School Dist
rict, which has purchased 11,000 iPads. This fall, 
every Mansfield High School student and teacher will receive an iPad under 

concept, putting their lessons and resources online
 
where students can 
access them anytime with their iPads. As a result, students take 
responsibility for their own learning and teachers are able to increase their 
interactions and personalize content time.
 
iPad continues its rapid adoption within the 
enterprise. We estimate that the 
number of iPads in the Fortune 500 has more than tripled in the past year. 
iPad has become an indispensable tool worldwide to help employees across 
industries do their jobs more effectively. British Airways has incorporated
 
thousands of iPads across their business from customer support at check
-
in 
to cabin service directors replacing paper printout to details customer 
preferences and provide real
-
time updates. And homebuilder Dialogue House 
in Japan is actively building smar
t homes that will be controlled by iPads, 
and their sales reps are using iPads to show floor plans and upgrade options.
 
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed 410 million 
cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 45 million in the June 
qu
arter. With App Stores in 155 countries, the iOS ecosystem continues to 
grow. The App Store now offers more than 650,000 apps, including over 

have surpassed $5.5 billion in payme
nt to developers, and customers are 
loving iCloud. Since its launch in October, more than 150 million people are 
using iCloud services.
 
In June, we previewed many of the exciting new features of iOS 6 at our 
Developers Conference, including our fabulous ne
w maps app, new 
functionality and broader language support for Siri, direct Facebook 
integration, shared photo streams via iCloud and Passbook, the simplest way 
to get all your passes in one place. We believe iOS 6 will significantly 
enhance the experience
 
of one in an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, and we 

 

increase of 17% over the year
-
ago quarter, with growth yield primaril
y by 
all
-
time record iPad sales and strong growth in iPhone sales. The store sold 
791,000 Macs compared to 768,000 in the year
-
ago quarter. And almost half 
the Macs sold in our stores during the quarter were the customers who had 
never owned a Mac before.
 
We opened a total of nine new stores in the quarter and exited the quarter 
with 372 stores, including 123 stores outside the United States. With an 
average of 367 stores opened, average revenue per store was $11.1 million 
compared to $10.8 million in the y
ear
-
ago quarter. Segment margin was 
$868 million compared to $802 million in the year
-
ago quarter. We 
welcomed 83 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 
74 million visitors in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 12%. That 
translate
s to an average of 17,000 visitors per store per week.
 
Total company gross margin was 42.8%, which was 130 basis points higher 
than our guidance. We experienced upside from better than expected 
commodity, warranty and other costs. These factors were partia
lly offset by 
a stronger mix of iPad sales, a higher mix of lower priced iPhones, and a 
stronger U.S. dollar relative to our expectations. Operating expenses were 
$3.4 billion and included $378 million in stock
-
based compensation expense. 
OI&E was $288 mil
lion and the tax rate was 25.6%.
 
Turning to cash, our cash for short
-
term and long
-
term marketable 
securities totaled $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to 
$110 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $7 
billio
n, and about $81 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the June 
quarter. Cash flow from operations was $10.2 billion.
 

of $2.55 per common share payable on August 16, 2012 
to stockholders of 
record after the close of business on August 13, 2012. Going forward, 
subject to declaration by our Board, we expect to announce record and 
payment dates for future dividends concurrently with our quarterly earnings 
announcements. Also, 
as we previously announced, our Board has 
authorized a three
-
year $10 billion share repurchase program starting in our 
fiscal 2013, which begins on September 30, 2012.
 

outlook, which inclu
des the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy 
referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 
billion compared to $28.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We 
expect gross margin to be about 38.5%, reflecting a
pproximately $70 million 
related to stock
-
based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about 
$3.5 billion, including about $390 million related to stock
-
based 
compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million and we expect the 
tax rate to be about 
25.50%. We are targeting EPS of about $7.65.
 

sales of over 17 million iPads. We established new June quarter records for 
unit sales of iPhone and Macs and posted our best quarter eve
r for U.S. 
education. We remain extremely confident in our strategy and the 

launching Mountain Lion tomorrow and iOS 6 in the fall and we have some 
more amazing new products in our pipelin
e that we look forward to 
discussing with you later.

up. 
May we have the first question, plea
se?
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Kathy Huberty 
with Morgan Stanley.
 
Kathryn Huberty 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Yes, thank you. Peter, I want to better understand the gross margin 


operated at a sub
-
40% gross margin. I understand mix may go against you 
a little bit in the near
-
term, but it should be structurally higher than two 
years ago, you have NAND pricing moving in your favor, and the products 
that you

cost should be favorable. Can you just talk about the dynamics that are 

-
up.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
We expect the gross margin as 
I said to be about 38.5%, which is down 
about 430 basis points sequentially. We expect most of this decline to be 
primarily driven by a fall transition and to a much lesser extent, the impact 
of the stronger U.S. dollar. The warranty benefit that we saw in
 
the June 
quarter is not repeating and a full quarter of the Back to School promotion. 

 
Kathryn Huberty 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. And then as a follow
-

growth in China over the last
 
several years, but there are some macro 
concerns in the market and your Asia
-
Pacific growth rate did decelerate from 

seeing in China as it relates to overall demand? Thank you.
 
Timo
thy D. Cook
 

-
Pacific was 25% as you indicated, 
and the vast majority of the difference in our sequential growth rate was a 
result of Greater China, which represents about two
-
thirds of our revenue of 
that region. 
As we reported for Q2, our Greater China revenue was $7.9 
billion; and in Q3, our revenue was $5.7 billion. Now the $5.7 billion is a 
48% year
-
over
-
year increase and so, it still is growing at incredible rates. 
Virtually, all of the $2.2 billion sequential
 
revenue decline, was due to iPhone 
sales in Greater China and about half of that $2.2 billion is attributable to 
changes in the channel inventory not the underlying sell through of the 
iPhone.
 
As a reminder, in the previous quarter, in our fiscal Q2, we l
aunched the 
iPhone 4S in China in January. We added China Telecom as the second 
carrier in March, and as we proceeded across the quarter, we increased the 
channel inventory to accommodate the sales and to reach our target 
inventory of four to six weeks. Th
e remainder of the sequential revenue 
decline is mainly attributable to normal seasonality after the very successful 
iPhone 4S launch. We did not see an obvious impact in Q3 that we would 
associate with the economy in Mainland China. We look at the economi
c 
report as all of you do and see the press. But again, we did not see 
something that we would attribute to the economy in China.
 
In terms of iPhones in general in Mainland China, we were incredibly pleased 
with our results. We were up over 100% year
-
over
-
year, and as you 
probably know, just last Friday, so in Q4, we launched our new iPad in China 
after we resolved the iPad trademark issue. And so our sales did not benefit 
from the new iPad in the June quarter in Mainland China. Also, our new 
portables that
 
we announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference began 
to ship in Mainland China last week after we received routine regulatory 
approval, and once again, the June quarter sales did not benefit from these 
products.
 
So, net, we remain really confident ab
out our plans and are very excited 
about our opportunity in China, and are very much looking forward to 
incorporating more local services as you probably saw in the Worldwide 
Developers Conference announcement of iOS 6, which will be coming in the 
fall.
 
Na
ncy Paxton
 
Thank you, Kathy. Could we have the next question please.
 
Operator
 
From Goldman Sachs, we will hear from Bill Shope.
 
Bill C. Shope 

 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay. Great, thanks. Can you talk about your thoughts on the individual 
segment trends 


about it now coming off of the sequential declines this quarter particularly on 
the iPhone segment?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure, 

can. I will first talk about the products and then a little bit about how we are 
thinking of revenue. For iPhone, we would expect to have a year
-
over
-
year 
increase in sales in the Sep
tember quarter. For iPad, we would also expect 
to have a year
-
over
-
year increase, but we would point out that we increased 
channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units. And in the year 
ago quarter, we also increased the iPad inventory at that
 
time by 1.5 million 
units. And for Mac, we would expect a sequential increase.
 

20% year
-
over
-


 
thinking. The 
first, we are not expecting t
he economies in Europe or the natural resource 
based countries including Australia, Brazil and Canada to improve from what 
we saw in the June quarter. As Tim said, we saw no obvious evidence of the 
economy impacting our sales in China in the June quarter o
r in the U.S., but 
we are reading the same things that you all are about these economies. So 
we will have to see.
 
Our weekly iPhone sales continue to be impacted by rumors and speculation 
regarding new products. We exited the June quarter in supply and dem
and 
balance and we were within our four to six week inventory target. We also 

September quarter.
 

in the
 
June quarter by 1.2 million units and we ended the June quarter just 
within our four to six week channel inventory target and we increased last 
year by 1.5 million units in the September quarter, which also put us in our 
four to six week inventory target.
 
These increases in channel inventory will 
impact both the year
-
over
-
year and sequential compares for iPad. The 
current iPad lineup that we're selling includes the very successful $399 price 
point, which we did not have in the year
-
ago quarter. So this, al
ong with mix 
in the line will impact the ASPs in the September quarter.
 
And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies around 
the world including the euro, Brazilian Real, the Chinese RMB, British Pound, 
Australian Dollar, Canadian D
ollar, Mexican Peso and Swiss Franc. We expect 
this to have an adverse impact to revenue in these countries in excess of 
$400 million sequentially net of our hedges. All that being said, we very 
much look forward to introducing iOS 6 in the fall and we rem
ain very 
confident in our business and our new product pipeline.
 
Bill C. Shope 

 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay. And just to follow
-
up if I could on the sequential iPhone decline. you 
gave us a pretty good outline of what was going on in China, but can you 
walk 
us through some of the trends you saw for iPhone demand sequentially 
in the other international region?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

understand as you compare our Q2 iPhone sales to Q3, th
ere is a fairly large 
channel inventory difference that is embedded in that. As you recall, in 
January, we completed the iPhone 4S rollout in all the major countries, 
including China. It was our fastest iPhone rollout ever. We were also able to 
get the cha
nnel at a 

 
within our target inventory range of four to six weeks 
by the end of March. And so what that did was, it increased sell in over sell 
through by 2.6 million units. In the quarter that we just finished, our sell in 
was less than sell through by 3
00,000 units. And so the net change in 
channel inventory across the quarter is about 3 million units. And so, I think 

trends.
 
In terms of what we see happening in the different geogra
phies, the U.S. 

mentioned Greater China was up 66%, but Mainland China was over doubled 

was Europe. Europe w
as essentially flat, slightly positive year
-
on
-
year and 
that really hampered our total results.
 

revenue level. We see a margin difference between the countries. The U.K. 
was rela
tively solid at 30% growth, but France and Greece and Italy were 
particularly poor, and Germany was also similarly a single
-
digit positive 
growth for the quarter. Eastern Europe was strong, materially stronger than 
Western Europe, but obviously the Western
 
European countries drive the 

seeing a slow down in business in that area. Fortunately, the U.S. and China, 

 
we would classify as an obvious economic issue.

Ben Alexander Reitzes 

 
Barcl
ays Capital, Inc.
 
Yeah, thanks a lot. My first question, I wanted to ask about the fall transition 
you mentioned, Peter, when you are talking about gross margin. Can you 
talk a little bit about that, what is the sequential impact on margins and 
revenue tha


-
term?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

I spoke about is driving most o
f the decline that we see sequentially in gross 

detail today and we could not be more confident in our new product pipeline.
 
Ben Alexander Reitzes 

 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. 
Just with regard to the iPhone in general, you mentioned there were 
speculation about new products and rumors, but do you have any 
quantification of how much that hurt sales in the quarter either from you or 
Tim, and how much that maybe channel inventory r

do in the next quarter maybe resulting from that type of speculation?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 


n incredible 
anticipation out there for future products and as you would expect given 

amount. In terms of channel inventory in the current quarter, we put our 
current thinking in
 
the guidance that Peter provided to you.

Shannon Cross 

 
Cross Research
 
Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about the Mac business, I mean it 
was up 2% year
-
over
-
year, clearly still outperforming the market, but can 

from 
say the product transition versus weak economy and then any thoughts on 
cannibalization of Mac by the iPad?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

data, but frankly we believe the primary factor for
 
our lower growth rate in 
the Mac area is the timing of our portable announcement within last quarter. 

incredibly well received. That was done with three weeks or less than three 
weeks 
remaining in the quarter. The year ago compare we made the 
transition in the portable area in February and so we were selling our new 
line up for the entire Q3 period.
 
And so, if you look at the data underneath that to further illustrate this, prior 
to the
 
Developers Conference, our weekly Mac sales were running below the 
prior year. After the Developers Conference, the MacBook Pros and the 
MacBook Airs drove year
-
over
-
year increases in weekly sell through. And 
they were to the level that got us back to an 
overall positive territory for the 
quarter and our 25 consecutive quarter of growing faster than the market. 
The MacBook Pro with the Retina display was incredibly well received, we 
ended the quarter in backlog, and we still have not caught up with demand 
yet, but anticipate doing so next month.
 
Also to further illustrate the portable point, for the month of June, the NPD 
data that just came out for the United States showed our portable share at 
25.5% and a record 47% of revenue share in the month of June. 
And so, I 
would attribute a large amount to what has happened in terms of the timing 
of our portable announcement.

Okay, great. And then could you talk a little bit, Tim, about what your 
conversations are like with the carrie
rs in terms of pricing, subsidies, there's 
been a lot of talk about that over the last few months. So just how are your 

coming?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Let me avoid talking about the pr

ask that. I don't want to get into specific topics about with different carriers, 
but generally I would just say that our role is to make the very best 
smartphone in the world and that has an incredible user exper
ience far 
superior than anything else that customers want to use everyday. And I 
think at the end of the day, the carriers want to buy or want to provide their 
customers with 

 
what their customers want to buy. And so the most 
important thing for Apple by 
far is to continue making the best products in 

maniacally focused on it.
 

the total subsidy that they pay is fair
ly small relative to the monthly 
payments they collect over a 24
-
month contract period. And I think many 
would tell you, they certainly told to me, that iPhone has several advantages 
for them over other smartphones, the churn rates are much less, you see 
c
arriers now focusing on shared data plans and I think an iPhone customer is 
likely more 

 
is more likely to have a Tablet or an iPad. And so I think they 
really value these customers quite a bit.
 
Also, our engineering teams are very sensitive to working wi
th carriers to 
find the most efficient way to deal with data. And we think that we are the 
most efficient smartphone on the market for smartphones that are in an app 
rich ecosystem. And so we are going to continue to focus 

 
focusing on 
making the best pro
duct and I think that the carriers will be very motivated 
to make sure that they provide that to the customers.

Toni M. Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. I have one for Peter and one for Tim, please. Peter, you 
talked about how you were above expectations relative to you
r guidance on 
iPhone, and you also mention you were above expectations on iPod, and you 
said you were thrilled iPad, yet your EPS I think came in 5% or 6% above 
your guidance. So perhaps you can help us illustrate where you were 
disappointed to relative to
 
your original guidance, because I think the 
commentary would certainly point to a much larger beat?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

Sales of each of our products did exceed what we had factored
 
into the 
guidance. That was especially true of the iPad, which set a new record at 17 
million units, and the $35 billion of revenue that we reported grew by $6.5 
billion year
-
over
-
year. We do think some things did this in the quarter, so let 
me comment on
 
that. The economy in Europe is not doing well. We think 
this impacted our results. We also saw some economic impact in the natural 
resource space economies, including Australia, Brazil and Canada.
 

rumors and 
speculation that you are about a new iPhone, and we think this has caused 

Bridge and resulting rumors about the new portables impacted our sales in 
April and May. Tim 
talked about how after WDC we saw a large increase in 
sales both in terms of weekly sales before WDC and on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis, and customers are loving the new MacBook Pro. and we did not get 
the benefit of launching the new iPad in China or the new p
ortables as we 
are pursuing routine regulatory approval.
 
and finally, the dollar strengthened against most currencies around the 
world, which reduced our revenue growth sequentially by over $200 million 
net of our hedges. So, we think these things impacted
 

happy very with how the business is performing and are excited about our 
new product pipeline.
 
Toni M. Sacconaghi 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you for that. Tim, the question that I had for you is, whether you 
could talk a lit
tle bit about smartphone growth in emerging markets. China is 

about 70% of the smartphones that are being purchased in places like China 
and other emerging countries are under $300, an
d in many cases under 
$200. Do you agree with that market characterization, and at some point 
does that become a limit 

 
does that limit your ability to gain share in a 
marketplace where its 70% of the units are at a price point that you 

ay in? At what point does that math prevent you from 
gaming share, and what are your strategies for ensuring continued share

what 



to grow our iPhone sales over a
 
100% last quarter. And so, yes, I feel very, 
very good about that, and I firmly believe that people in the emerging

more important, and overshadows all other things. But we do believe by 
doing that, that we will have a great business, and I think that our results 
today really sh
ow that.

Yeah, correct.

Andy Hargreaves

Yeah, okay. So then the comments on iPad being just slightly within the 
range of four to six weeks, which seem to imply a fairly sign
ificant slowdown 

expectation?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Keep in mind that the channel inventory is only for the indirect channel. But, 

s are Apple retail

w that there are some companies out there they refer to their channel

that. How are you thinking about that now on the iPad side? Now that there 
is so
me slightly higher quality competition like the Nexus 7 at lower price 
points?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
We re
-
priced the iPad 2 to $399, and it did very well in the quarter. The 
most popular iPad is the new iPad, but iPad 2 did very well. It was 
particularly a key 
in the K
-
12 area that Peter spoke about earlier where we 
sold about 1 million units for the quarter. And so, we have been very 


undreds of them 
come to market over the last few year. And I have yet to see any of them 
really gain what I would call any level of traction at all.
 
We have over 225,000 apps that have been optimized for iPad. There is a 
incredible experience on iPad, and 
I still think the market very much where 



ess going 
forward.
 
The 17 million iPads was up 84% year
-
over

over 84 million, this is as of the end of last quarter. iPads, which if you look 
at that on a trajectory rate, it took us more than twice as long to achieve 
that on iP

we achieved it in the third less time on 
the iPad than iPhone, so we feel really, really good about our momentum in 
this space.

Hey, good afternoon. Tim, I know you just talked a little bit about the iPad 
that is there. You gave a little 
bit more information on the iPhone. Could you 
talk a little bit more about just what segments have been driving, you 
mentioned little bit of education, is it U.S. consumer, U.S. corporate market, 
is it channel sale in other markets, any more kind of feedba
ck for us to help 
kind of navigate how to model this in the next few quarters?
 
Timothy D. Cook

over

triple
-
digit growth rates in many, many geographies. Generally speaking, 
the internati
onal markets in the aggregate are extremely strong, in the 
triple
-
digits internationally. The U.S. is a bit lower, but I think it's important 
to keep in mind that the U.S. was on a faster adoption curve with iPad. And 

rywhere. Latin America is tripling. 

shocking in terms of the growth rate. We would not have dreamed of 
shipping over 17 million last quarter, and feel very, very good about it.
 
Gene A.

Okay. And that's helpful. And did you give maybe I missed it, but did you 
give an Apple TV number for the quarter and any kind of updated thoughts, 
and how you're thinking about that going forward?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes, 

quarter this was up over a 170% year

over

year, and it brings our fiscal 
year to 4 million units, which is pretty incredible. It's still at a level that we 
would call it a hobby. B
ut we continue to pull the string to see where takes 

so, there's a lot of people here that are believers in Apple TV and we 
continue to invest in it and see where it will take us.
 
G
ene A. Munster

So you don't do hobbies for the sake of hobbies, you do it to hope to get to 
be some bigger?

And so we'll see, I think this 4 mi

From JPMorgan, we will go to Mark Moskowitz.
 
Mark A. Moskowitz 

 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Yes, thank you. The first question is around ASPs, the iPad and the iPhone, 
the blended ASPs seem to have declined a littl
e more this quarter versus the 
prior quarters. Is that a function of the product portfolio or Apple just testing 
price elasticity as you expand into the emerging markets?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 

ad and 
iPhone ASPs, but I would like to give you a little bit of color this quarter, 
because they did change some sequentially in the case of the iPad year
-
over
-
year. Beginning with the iPhone, the ASP was down due to a higher mix 
of lower priced models an
d a stronger U.S. dollar and that was the case 
generally on a sequential and a year
-
over
-
year. Regarding the mix, we 
believe that this was largely driven by all the new product rumors, economic 
conditions, particularly in Europe and we had a change in the 
ending 
inventory by models that also influence the ASPs.
 
For the iPad, it was down more year
-
over
-
year than it was sequentially. The 
year
-
over
-
year decrease was really attributable to four things. We had a 
higher mix of lower priced models, we reduced the 
price of the iPad 2 to 
$399, with our expanded distribution, we had a higher mix of indirect sales 
this year than we did a year ago and the dollar impacted us as well.

Okay, thank you, Peter for that. Tim, I want

term. You 


kind of a stepping stone to Apple, have any greater role in a digital wall
et in 
terms of the structure?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

general is a very key feature. I think all of us have found that we were 
getting many passes and many tickets and so forth, they were
 
scattered all 
over 

 
maybe boarding passes, et cetera, they were scattered all over our 
iPhones in different apps. And so Passbook does an incredible job of pulling 

it might be

speculate about where it might take us.

Chris Whitmore 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities
 
Thanks very much. I wanted to follow
-
up on the pricing question and as 
specifically around the iPad as to whether or not you think the lower price 
po
int drove elasticity of demand for that product, in other words, were your 
sales incrementally higher or as a result of this economic environment, did 
you see customers migrate down market to lower
-
priced products, because 
spending is a little tighter thes
e days?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 

sales would be incrementally larger that there was price elasticity and that 
there was a buyer that really wanted the best product and that needed it to 
be 
a little less expensive, and so I believe that we saw that. I think it did 

-
12. The adoption rate of 

in history. Usually, educat
ion tends to be a fairly conservative institution in 
terms of buying or K

And so I think it was 

 

we did it.

And just a follow

up, I wanted to ask about the opportunity that you see in 
India. A few years back, you talked about initial investments in China, and 

India, and what is your outlo
ok for growth in that geography specifically 
going forward?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
You know of course I love India, but I believe that Apple has some higher 


mphasis in India, we are. We have a business 
there, that business is growing, but the sort of the multilayer distribution 

going to continue putting some energies there, but my own p
erspective is 
that in the intermediate term there will be larger opportunities outside of

Okay. Thanks for having on. Just a quick question in terms of component 
availability particularly new components? Thanks.

im. We factored supply into the guidance that Peter has given 
you. Generally, I should say that we have been short of the MacBook Pro 
with the Retina displays, we ended the quarter with backlog and we are 
working really hard to deliver those to customers q
uickly and we believe that 
we will be in supply and demand balance in August.
 


other than anything that w

be spending our energies on trying to mitigate that.

Great, thanks guys. Clearly Apple's design philosophy has been abo
ut 
building great products as opposed to kind of going in the market, hitting 
certain price points. But how do you think about the opportunities to address 
maybe some of those opportunities that are down at some of those lower 
price points, with your exist
ing products without essentially compromising 

 
Timothy D. Cook
 

best products and economic turmoil, may push us side to
 

going to stay on that journey and stay focused on making the best product, 

years, that during these type of periods are where we distanced ourselves 
further from people 


 


$399 iPad, just
 
a few months ago. And the iPhone 3GS is free in the United 
States, and in several other countries. And there has been quite a lot 
knocked off the price of that in certain other markets. And so, our North Star 
that will be making the best products in the w


 
Brian Marshall

Thanks. And then, when you think about how the iPhone has penetrated the 

th

volatility about the rumors and speculation about kind of future products 
being announced. And so, could you talk a little bit about how you try to 
manage sort of the iPhone transitions
 
and the carrier ramp as well, I mean 
obviously, you mentioned not going to be launching any major countries or 

to see something later on in the year. So if you can talk a littl
e bit about how 
you kind of manage that whole sort of transition/carrier ramp up that would 
be great? Thank you.

Brian, we try very hard to keep our product roadmap secret and confidential, 
and we go to extreme, do extreme activities to try

today will consist of forward
-
looking statements, including, without 
limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin
, operating expenses, other 
income and expense, stock
-
based compensation expense, taxes, earnings 
per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially 
from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors 
disc
ussed in Apple's Form 10
-
K for 2011, the Form 10
-
Q for the first quarter 
of fiscal 2012 and the Form 8
-
K filed with the SEC today along with the 
attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward
-
looking statements or information, wh
ich speak as of their respective dates.
 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory 
remarks.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Thank you, Nancy. We're very pleased to report the results of our 
outstanding second fiscal quarter. We established 
new March quarter records 
for iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, leading to our highest March quarter revenue 
and earnings ever.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $39.2 billion, representing year
-
over
-
year 
growth of 59%. That's a new record for a March quarter and is s
econd only 
to the all
-
time record revenue we reported in the most recent December 
quarter. The year
-
over
-
year increase in March quarter revenue was fueled 
primarily by very strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales.
 
Operating margin was $15.4 billion, represe
nting 39.3% of revenue. Net 
income was $11.6 billion, increasing 94% over the prior March quarter's 
result. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $12.30.
 
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products 
and services. We established new March quarter records for both desktops 
and portables, combining for a total of 4 million Macs sold. This represents 
growth of 7% year
-
over
-
year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 
2% growth for the global person
al computer market in the March quarter. 
We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac 
channel inventory, which is below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks.
 
In February, we released the developer preview of Mountain Lion, the ninth 
major r
elease of Mac OS X. Mountain Lion will bring popular apps and 
features from iPad to the Mac, including Messages, Notes, Reminders, Game 
Center, Notification Center, Share Sheets, Twitter integration and AirPlay 
Mirroring. We expect Mountain Lion to be avai
lable from the Mac App Store 
in late summer this year.
 
Moving to our music products. We sold 7.7 million iPods compared to 9 
million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our 
expectations, and iPod touch continued to account for over half
 
of all iPods 
sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% 
based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continued to 
be the top
-
selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest 
data published by 
GFK.
 
We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod 
channel inventory.
 
The iTunes Store generated all
-
time record results with revenue of almost 
$1.9 billion in the March quarter, an increase of 35% year
-
over
-
year, thanks 
to continued
 
strong sales of music, video and apps. We now have a catalog 
of over 28 million songs and 45,000 movies.
 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell 35.1 million iPhones 
compared to 18.6 million in the previous March quarter. That represents 
88% year
-
over
-
year growth compared to 42% growth for the smartphone 
market overall in the March quarter based on the latest published estimate 
from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our 
segments, led by our Asia Pacific and Japa
n segments where sales more 
than doubled year
-
over
-
year. We continue to see tremendous momentum in 
Greater China, where iPhone sales were 5x the level of the year ago quarter, 
aided by the launch of the iPhone 4S in China in January and the addition of 
Chi
na Telecom as an iPhone carrier in March. IPhone 4S is now available in 
over 100 countries and is sold through over 230 carriers.
 
We ended the quarter with about 8.6 million iPhones in channel inventory, a 
sequential increase of about 2.6 million units, wh
ich placed us within our 
target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
 
Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $22.7 
billion during the quarter compared to $12.3 billion in the year ago quarter, 
an increase of 85%.
 
iPhone
 
momentum in the enterprise has evolved beyond email, calendar and 
contacts. IT and business line managers across industries see the 
opportunity to leverage both company and employee
-
owned devices to 
improve productivity and efficiencies through iOS in
-
hou
se app development. 
In fact, the majority of the Fortune 500 companies who have approved 
iPhone on their networks are members of the iOS Developer Enterprise 
Program and are actively deploying in
-
house applications to their employee 
base.
 
Turning to iPad. 
We were very pleased with sales of 11.8 million iPads during 
the March quarter compared to 4.7 million in the year ago quarter, an 
increase of 151%. Customers are loving the new iPad with its stunning 
Retina display, A5X chip with Quad
-
core graphics and th
e 5
-
megapixel iSight 
camera. The new iPad is now available in over 40 countries, and we saw a 
very strong growth in iPad sales around the world with sales more than 
doubling in each of our segments.
 
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessorie
s during the 
quarter was $6.6 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago quarter, an 
increase of 132%. We ended the quarter with about 2 million iPads in 
channel inventory, a sequential decrease of about 300,000 units, which 
placed us below our targe
t range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory.
 
The education market's interest in iPad continues to grow. In the March 
quarter, we sold more than 2 iPads for every Mac to our U.S. K
-
12 
customers while also generating a record quarter for Mac sales. The
 
San 
Diego School District purchased 10,000 iPads in the March quarter and plans 
to purchase over 15,000 more in the June quarter for middle school and high 
school programs.
 
iPad continues to open doors to new customers with whom Apple previously 
had no re
lationship. As we enter the K
-
12 institution buying season, we're 
hopeful that iPad will be a popular choice.
 
iPad's momentum in business and government also continues to build. The 
United States Air Force Air Mobility Command is deploying thousands of 
iPa
ds to serve as electronic flight bags, storing technical publications and 
operations information for flight crew members and trainers. Companies 
such as Bechtel and Balfour Beatty are using iPads in the field for project 
management and viewing blueprints. 
And thousands of iPads are being 
deployed as mobile sales tools by companies such as Roche, Amgen, Bayer 
and Daiichi Sankyo. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 
365 cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 50 million in the March 
quar
ter. The iOS ecosystem continues to expand and thrive with stores in 
more than 120 countries.
 
The App Store now offers more than 600,000 apps, including over 200,000 
apps specifically for iPad. We were very excited to announce the download of 
the 25th bill
ionth app in March less than 4 years after the launch of the App 
Store.
 
And iCloud is off to an incredible start, currently with more than 125 million 
customers signed up since its launch in October.
 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which a
lso generated record 
March quarter results. Revenue was $4.4 billion, an increase of 38% over 
the year ago quarter and was second only to the record quarterly revenue 
generated in the December quarter. The stores experienced very strong 
year
-
over
-
year grow
th in iPad and iPhone sales, and they sold 826,000 Macs 
compared to 797,000 in the year ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold 
in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who had never 
owned a Mac before.
 
We opened 2 new stores in the quart
er, including our first Netherlands store 
in Amsterdam and a beautiful new store in Houston. We exited the quarter 
with 363 stores, nearly 1/3 of which are outside the United States. With an 
average of 361 stores open, average revenue per store was $12.2 m
illion 
compared to $9.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 23%. 
Segment margin reached a new March quarter record of over $1.1 billion, 
which was 26.1% of retail revenue. We welcomed 85 million visitors to our 
stores during the quarter compare
d to 71 million visitors in the year ago 
quarter, an increase of 19%. That translates to an average of 18,000 visitors 
per store per week.
 
Total company gross margin was 47.4%, which was 540 basis points higher 
than our guidance. About half this 
difference was driven by lower
-
than
-
expected commodity and other costs; about 1/4 was due to stronger
-
than
-
expected revenue and product mix, including 35 million iPhones; and the 
remainder was due to some onetime items that we don't expect to recur in 
the 
June quarter.
 
Operating expenses were $3.2 billion and included $361 million in stock
-
based compensation expense. OI&E was $148 million.
 
Turning to cash. Our cash for short
-
term and long
-
term marketable 
securities totaled $110.2 billion at the end of the M
arch quarter compared to 
$97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of 
$12.6 billion. And about $74 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of 
the March quarter. Cash flow from operations was $14 billion.
 
As we indicated la
st month, subject to board declaration, we expect to 
announce a dividend of $2.65 [ph] per share when we report our third 
quarter results in July. And we will provide information on the record and 
payment dates at that time.
 
As we move ahead into the June 
quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, 
which includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion 
compared to $28.6 billion in the June quarter last year. We expe
ct gross 
margin to be about 41.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to 
stock
-
based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.3 
billion, including about $385 million related to stock
-
based compensation. 
We expect OI&E to be about $175 
million. And we expect the tax rate to be 
about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.68.
 
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record March quarter 
performance with earnings nearly doubling year
-
over
-
year. The new iPad is 
off to a tremendous sta
rt and is our fastest iPad rollout ever. We're thrilled 
with the global success of the iPhone 4S, which is now available in more 
than 100 countries, including China.
 
We remain very confident in our strategy, and we're very excited about the 
fabulous new pr
oducts in our pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to 
questions.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
As it relates to the June quarter revenue guidance, it implies a sequential 
downtick that is worse than the guidance message you provided over the 
last 3 yea
rs. So can you just talk about some of the headwinds sequentially 
you see on the top line in the June quarter relative to March?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Sure, Katy. It's Peter. The manufacturing ramps for the iPhone 4S and the 
new iPad were extremely successful 
for us. They yielded the highest launch 
supply and the fastest country rollouts for these product families that we've 
ever had. As a result, we were able to fulfill demand in the March quarter 
rather than the June quarter this year, and that generated reve
nue of over 
$39 billion. Therefore, unlike last year, we expect a sequential decline in 
revenue this year. I'd highlight 5 primary factors that have influenced our 
thinking:
 
The first, the iPhone channel inventory changes. As I discussed in my 
prepared rem
arks, we increased our iPhone channel inventory by about 2.6 
million units in the March quarter this year, and we exited within our target 
inventory range of about 4 to 6 weeks. Last year, we continued to add new 
countries into the June quarter, and we bui
lt an additional 700,000 units of 
iPhone channel inventory last year in the June quarter. So the combination 
of these channel builds in the March quarter of this year and the June 
quarter of last year will impact the sequential comparisons from this year t
o 
last.
 
The second factor: fabulous iPhone 4S execution. As we told you in January, 
we exited December with significant iPhone 4S backlog, which led to a huge 
January. We launched China and 20 other countries also in January, which 
completed the rollout of
 
the iPhone 4S into all the countries where iPhone is 
currently shipping. And as I said before, we exited the quarter within a 
supply and demand balance.
 
The third factor: our new iPad execution was also fabulous. We had an 
incredible start with the new iP
ad. We launched with significant supply, 
leading to sales of 3 million units in the first couple of days, which was the 
--
 
and also the fastest country rollout ever. We therefore were able to satisfy 
much more of the demand for the new iPad in the March qu
arter this year 
compared to the iPad 2 in the March quarter of last year. This resulted in a 
shift of iPad volume into March this year versus last, and it will also affect 
the sequential compares this year to the last.
 
Fourth, we decreased the entry price 
of the entry iPad to $399.
 
And finally, the last factor to point out, the U.S. dollar has strengthened 
recently, and we expect this to have an impact on the sequential compare, 
especially versus last year when the dollar weakened against most 
currencies ov
er the comparable time periods.
 
We 
--
 
look, we've just reported the most amazing March quarter Apple has 
ever had. We feel very, very good about our business and our new product 
pipeline.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Just as a quick fol
low
-
up to number 4, the decrease in iPad price. You 
already saw a 7% sequential decline in March, which suggests that the 
uptake of the lower
-
priced iPad 2 was pretty phenomenal in March. Is that 
the right way to read it? And what does that demand tell you
 
about the 
potential to move to lower price points on the iPad over time and see 
significant incremental demand?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Look, Katy, we're just learning about be the elasticity of demand and the 
$399 price point. It's doing well. But I have to te
ll you, the new iPad is on 
fire, and we're selling them as fast as we can make them. So we'll learn 
more over this quarter especially as we get through the education buying 
season, which looks terrific for us especially on the iPad.

I recognize that you outgrew the market in Macs yet again. But I did want to 
get your views on the slowdown in year
-
over
-
year growth rate within the 
category and what 
factors you would attribute that to. Are we 
--
 
is it product 
transition related? Were the inventories down quarter
-
over
-
quarter? iPad 
cannibalization? Any other color that you can provide would be helpful.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes, Rich, it's Tim. As you said, 
we did outgrow the market. Macs grew at 
about 7% where the market grew about 2%. And so this is the 24th straight 
quarter that we've outgrown the market, and so we're extremely pleased 
with that. The compare to last year is largely affected by the fact tha
t we 
changed the bulk of our portable line, or the MacBook Pros, in the February 
time frame of 2011. And so it's a very tough compare. Specifically, the 
portables last year were up 53% year
-
on
-
year. And obviously, that 
--
 
so that 
compare was very difficult
. If you look at it sequentially, you also have to 
factor in that we had 14 weeks in the December quarter. And so the 26% 
year
-
over
-
year growth in December quarter is probably more like 17% when 
you factor out that 14th week. And so yes, I think there was 
some 
cannibalization from iPad and the market is slow. But the much, much larger 
factor and in fact, in 
--
 
it might be the vast majority of the difference is the 
compare to a year ago.

I was wondering if you could talk more broadly just about what you might be 
learning about lower priced 
--
 
price points on both the iPhone and iPad. I 
know it was as
ked earlier. But was the decrease in iPad price exclusively mix 
related? Or are there 
--
 
or is it a further broadening of your channel to 
indirect partners? But more broadly, Tim, maybe you could talk about 
elasticity, what you're learning about customer p
references for lower
-
priced 
offerings on both the iPhone and iPad. And I do have a follow
-
up, please.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Sure. Tony, on iPad 2, we're 
--
 
with the change in the entry price to $399, 
we're actually thrilled with the results that we've seen, alth
ough, as Peter 
said, it's only been a few weeks. And so it's too early to make a 
--
 
come to a 
clear conclusion. But from what we are seeing, this unlocks some education 
demand that is probably a more price
-
sensitive customer. Also, in several 
other countri
es, there was a marked change in demand at that price point. 
And so on the early going, we feel great about it. But I'd also point out that 
the new iPad is 
--
 
was current 
--
 
was supply constrained last quarter for the 
full 3 weeks or so it was shipping and
 
is actually still constrained. And so the 
mix of the new iPad to the iPad 2, we're not certain of what that is yet. But 
we are certain, with what we've seen so far, that the absolute sales of iPad 
2, at least in the early going, is very exciting. On the i
Phone, we continue to 
be very happy with the moves that we made in pricing just a few months 
ago on the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4. And both of them contributed to 
our ability to achieve 35 million in sales, which is our second highest quarter 
of all time
.

The 
--
 
as a second question, I was wondering if you can talk about how you 
think about the markets for tablet and PC devices going forward. I think 
you've been fairly clear about sayin
g that you believe that tablets will eclipse 
PCs in volume at some point. And I think you've also said they're somewhat 
discrete markets. There seems to be a lot of work, particularly on PC
-
based 
platforms, towards trying to combine the PC and tablet exper
ience going 
forward in part because Windows 8 will be able to 
--
 
is a touch
-
based 
operating system as well. Can you comment about why you don't believe the 
PC or the Ultrabook and tablet markets or your MacBook Air and tablet 
markets won't converge? Isn't 
it realistic to think in a couple of years we're 
going to have a device that's under 2 pounds with great battery life that we 
can all carry around and open as a notebook or close up in a clever way and 
use as a tablet? Can you comment on why you don't thin
k that product 
might not come or why you believe these markets are separate?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
I think, Tony, anything can be forced to converge. But the problem is that 
products are about trade
-
offs, and you begin to make trade
-
offs to the point 
where what 
you have left at the end of the day doesn't please anyone. You 
can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not 
going to be pleasing to the user. And so our view is that the tablet market is 
huge. And we've said that since day o
ne. We didn't wait until we had a lot of 
results. We were using them here, and it was already clear to us that there 
was so much you could do and that the reasons that people would use those 
would be so broad. And that's precisely what we've seen. We 
--
 
th
e iPad has 
taken off not only in consumer in a meaningful way but in education and in 
enterprise, and it's sort of everywhere you look now. And the applications 
are so easy to make very meaningful for someone, and there 
--
 
the 
--
 
there's such an abundance 
of those that 
--
 
and as the ecosystem gets better 
and better and as we continue to double down on making great products, I 
think that the limit here is nowhere in sight. We've now 
--
 
through the last 
quarter, I should say, which is just 2 years after we sh
ipped the initial iPad, 

sell that many Macs and 5 years for that many iPods and over 3 years for 
that many iPhones. And we were extremely happy with the trajectory on all 
of tho
se products. And so I think iPad, it's a profound product. It 
--
 
the 
breadth of it is incredible, and the appeal of it is universal. And so I am 
--
 
I 
could not be happier with being in the market, and the level at which we're 
innovating in both the product
 
and the ecosystem here is incredible. Now in 
terms of the market itself, IDC and Gartner and Forrester had some 
numbers out there. I think Gartner is saying there's somewhere around 375 
or so by 2015. Forrester is 375, somewhere around there. And so basic
ally, 
the 
--
 
they're in the mid
-
300s, which is about where the PC market is today. 
And 2015 is only 3 years from now. And so I think even the more formal 
predictors outside of us are beginning to see these lines cross. And so I 
strongly believe that they w
ill. Now having said that, I also believe that 
there is a very good market for the MacBook Air, and we continue to 
innovate in that product. And 
--
 
but I do think that it appeals to somewhat 
--
 
someone that has a little bit different requirements. And you 
wouldn't want 
to put these things together because you wind up compromising in both and 
not pleasing either user. Some people will prefer to own both, and that's 
great, too. But I think to make the compromises of convergence, so 
--
 
we're 
not going to that 
party. Others might. Others might from a defensive point 
of view, particularly. But we're going to play in both.

Tim, there's been quite a bit of 
concern both in the press and within the 
investment community around carrier subsidies. And I think the concerns 
are generally twofold: First, that carriers will attempt to stretch out the 
replacement cycle. And second, that over time, carriers across the 
globe will 
attempt to reduce subsidies significantly. I mean, how do you think about 
this risk? And do you think there are factors that could pressure subsidies 
going forward? And how would that impact Apple?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Well, Bill, our focus is on mak
ing the very best smartphone in the world. And 
a phone that delivers a 
--
 
just an off
-
the
-
charts user experience that 
customers want to use every day of their lives. And at the end of the day, I 
think that carriers, the vast majority of carriers, or maybe 
even all carriers, 
want to provide what their customers want to buy. And that's what they're 
motivated for. And so the most important thing by far is for Apple to 
continue making great products that customers want. And we are deeply 
committed to doing this
 
and are innovating at a rate and pace that's 
unbelievable in this area. For 
--
 
from a carrier's perspective, I think it's 
important to remember that the subsidy is not large relative to the sum of 
the monthly payments across a 24
-
month contract period. An
d any delta 
between iPhone and maybe another phone is a 
--
 
an even smaller level of 
difference. And the iPhone has some distinct advantages for the carrier over 
competing smartphones. For example, many of the carrier executives have 
told me that churn from
 
iPhone customers is the lowest of any phone they 
sell in their whole 
--
 
in all of the phones they carry. And that has a 
significant direct financial benefit to the carrier. Also, our engineering teams 
work extremely hard to be efficient with data and diff
erently than some 
others. And we believe that as a result of this, that iPhone has far better 
data efficiency compared to other smartphones that are using sort of an 
app
-
rich ecosystem. Finally, we think that the 
--
 
and this is the most 
important, is that 
iPhone is the best smartphone on the planet to entice a 
customer who is currently using a traditional mobile phone to upgrade to a 
smartphone. This is by far the largest opportunity for Apple, for our carrier 
partners and is a great, fantastic experience t
o the customer. And so there's 
a win
-
win
-
win there. And so I think all of these factors are 
--
 
some of these 
factors are missed in this general discussion of subsidy.

That's helpful. I had one oth
er follow
-
up question, if I could. I appreciate the 
user stats you gave us on iCloud. But can you give us any color, now it's 
been out for a few months, on how consumers are actually using iCloud? 
And in particular, are you seeing a big uptake in iTunes Ma
tch and paid 
storage additions? And how should we think about that?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Bill, it's Peter. Customers are using all the features of iCloud. Response has 
been terrific. Feedback has been terrific. Pickup on storage is occurring, but 
it's growing
 
because we've just launched iCloud in October. And we've now 
got over 125 million users that have come on to the service since then and 
they're building up documents in music and other things that they want to 
store. And so I think storage growth will com
e more over time. Our real 
desire here was not about selling more storage. We think Match is a great 
product, and we recommend that everybody use it. But it's a paid for 
service. We just really wanted to increase the customer delight from the 
entire ecosys
tem and platform of our iOS devices and the Mac, and that's 
why we've done iCloud. And we just 
--
 
we couldn't be happier that just a 
couple months into this, there's more than 125 million users around the 
world on iCloud.

If you could dig a little bit more into what's going on in China. I know you 
gave some high
-
level numbers. But is this increased distribution points, is it 
just pr
ice elasticity of lower
-
priced 3GS? Is it more people in China having 
money? All of the above? Anything that you can tell us to explain this 
vertical growth?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Gene, it was an incredible quarter in China. We 
--
 
the revenue was record 
--
 
was a record at $7.9 billion in Greater China, which is up over 3x year
-
over
-
year and brings the first half revenue for Greater China to $12.4 billion. That 
compares to a full year last year of $13.3 billion. So it is mind
-
boggling that 
we can do this well
. A part of this was the pent
-
up demand for iPhone 4S. As 
you know, we launched mainland China in January of this year, and so China 
was not able to get into the Q1 period. So all of that is in Q2. We also have 
very strong demand for iPad 2. We have not sh
ipped in mainland China yet 
the new iPad, although we are shipping in Hong Kong. And so it's a 
combination of these things. And the halo that both of these products have 
produced for the Mac is also incredible. Mac was up over 60% year
-
over
-
year. And that 
compares to a market rate of growth of about 6%. We have 
expanded point of sales. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, Mac is up 70% but still 
only 1,800 for all of Greater China. And so there's obviously a lot more 
opportunity there. iPhone, we're up over 11,000, w
hich is 138%. But 11,000 
is a much smaller number than we have in the U.S., and obviously, China 
will, in the next few years, be a bigger opportunity. iPad is only in 2,500 
points of sale. And so yes, we've expanded. We've expanded a lot. However, 
there's 
a lot of headroom here in our view.

Was the iPhone mix in China different than the rest of the world? Or how 
was it different?

I don't have that in front of me, but my reco

materially different. But keep in mind that iPhone 4S just launched in

quarter, you would expect it to mix fairly much toward the new product.

And just one final quick question on iTunes content. It seems that there's 
kind of this logjam to getting more TV shows and movies and the rentals, 
and it's been a little bit of a slow pace of imp
rovement. How important is 
getting better content on iTunes? And what's going to break that logjam?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Gene, it's Peter. We're actually thrilled with the rate that we're adding 
content into iTunes. This is something that we have to do countr
y by 
country, so it takes a bit of time to put in place. We have the largest catalog 
of songs and movies available anywhere, over 28 million songs. And this led 
to almost $1.9 billion of revenue in the March quarter, which was up 35% 
year

over

year. So we'
re thrilled with the progress that we're making in 
iTunes and customers love it.

Tim, the other big issue outside of the subsidy question 
that you just 
answered a couple of calls ago was regarding shortages. There's talk about 
potential Qualcomm shortages into the next couple of quarters and potential 
constraints even at year end for some pretty neat products that might be 
good for you to ha
ve in some products down the road. I know you don't 
comment on future products, but this is a big concern. And I guess can you 
just talk directionally about whether you expect long term to get your 
--
 
more than your fair share of product and what you need?
 
And do you see 
any bottlenecks on the horizon that are major in that department or in any 
component down the line over the long term?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Tough question to answer, Ben. Obviously, we're aware of the lithography 
transition issue that you mentio
ned with 28 nanometer. We currently do not 
use 28
-
nanometer parts. But as you also know, we don't comment about 
future products, and so I can't talk about the future part. Generally, outside 
of this, we work very closely with our supplier partners and do e
verything 
that we can do to get supply. And sometimes, we're successful with that, 
and sometimes we're not. And so you can bet that we are focused on 
anything that we think may impact us and trying to push every button within 
our disposal to work on it.

There's no plan to be in 10,000. And so we're trying some things. And as 
you know, that doesn't i
nclude the Mac. And so we're trying some things and 
seeing how it goes. And they've been a very good partner for us on iPod and 
have been selling iPods for a while and are an increasingly more substantial 
partner in the iPad space as well and an evolving p
artner on iPhone. And so

Tim, for you, I think. Could you add 
some more specifics on iPhones in Asia 
Pacific, including China? Is supply
-
demand in balance there? Or that 
--
 
can 
that be a help? And then more broadly, with iPhones getting increased 
inventory of 2.6 million units, will that be a 
--
 
will that, in fact, g
o down in 
the June quarter? Is there any comments, you could provide there? And 
then I have a follow
-
up, please.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes, let me start with the 
--
 
your last question. On the 2.6 million, our 
desire, just to be very clear on this, our desire was
 
to increase inventory 
--
 
channel inventory across the quarter. As you might recall, we ended with 
only 6 million units in the channel coming out of December because we were 
extremely backlogged. And this is on particularly 
--
 
this is on 4S specifically. 
O
ur target is to be between 4 million and 6 million. The addition of the 2.6 
million allowed us to get within that range by the end of the quarter. And so 
we feel that we exited the quarter as supply and demand balanced. Because 
our execution, the ops team 
was so good, the vast majority of the supply
-
demand in the different countries was reached by the end of January. And so 
we had the mother of all Januarys with the 
--
 
with really getting out of the 
vast majority of the iPhone 4S backlog and launching China
 
as well. And so 
it was an incredible, incredible start of the quarter for us. Your other 
question was?
 
Keith F. Bachman 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
On China specifically. It sounds like China can still be a help. Or it sounds 
like China is still supply
-
dem
and imbalanced. But I wanted to see if you 
could add some thoughts [ph] there in terms of iPhones.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
No. China is not supply
-
demand imbalanced on iPhone. On iPad, worldwide, 
we're supply constrained on the new iPad, both coming out of last quarter. 
And to give you a current view, we're still supply constrained on the new 
iPad. Demand has been incredibly r
obust, and we are selling them as fast as 
we can make them, as Peter mentioned earlier. In China, I believe on a 
macro basis, China has an enormous number of people moving into the 
higher income groups, middle class, if you will. And this is creating a 
dem
and for goods, not just Apple's but other companies' goods as well. And 
so I think there's a tremendous opportunity for companies that understand 
China, and we're doing everything we can to understand it and serve the 
market as good as we can.

It certainly seems so. Tim, for my follow
-
up from Bill Shope's question, there 
have been some changes in Spain in particular on the behavior of their 
carriers and the economics. And Vodafone has actually changed some of 
thei
r subsidy levels. It's only been about 30 days or 35 days, but have you 
seen any changes in demand levels in the Spanish market as a consequence 
of some of the activities of the carriers? And that's it for me.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes. Keith, Spain has been wea
k for us and probably more broadly for many 
companies. We 
--
 
our revenues grew in Spain last quarter but materially less 
than we grew in Europe or worldwide. However, that wasn't cause and effect 
related to the issue you're on, that Spain is just in a, I t
hink, terrible 
economic situation. And so I sort of look at that as an unusual case. To be 
clear about what was done, is that 
--
 
I think there's also some noise in the 
pike on this one. What the carriers did was they still have subsidies for their 
existing
 
customers. And I don't want to talk about what the 
--
 
their existing 
customer
-
to
-
new customer ratio is, but you can find out numbers from 
different parts of the world and model that. They pulled subsidies on new 
customers. And so it wasn't a pull of all s
ubsidies, it was a pull of subsidies 
from new. And it 
--
 
all carriers in that market did not do that. A couple of 
the carriers did. So I wouldn't necessarily use that as a proxy for the world, I 
guess, is my point.

sequential increase in sales. And I've got a

d talk a little bit about 
the gross margin guidance that we provided for the June quarter. We're 
pleased to be providing a gross margin guidance of 41.5% for the quarter. 
We expect about 2/3 of the sequential decline to be primarily driven by a 
higher mix 
of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling the current iPad lineup 
and lots of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. And we would expect 
the remainder of the difference to be primarily driven by the items benefiting 
the March quarter gross margin t

innovating and 
outgunning the competition rather th
an wage an ongoing litigation? Are

where we could be as
sured that's the case and a fair settlement on the stuff 
that's occurred, I would highly prefer to settle versus battle. But it

the key

Scott, in terms of component costs for the quarter we just finished, Q2 
component costs were better than we had planned, and
 
this assisted us in 
exceeding our gross margin guidance, as Peter talked about earlier. Displays 
and NAND flash drove the majority of the favorable commodity cost benefit. 
In terms of the June quarter and the 
--
 
what we factored into our guidance, 
NAND an
d mobile DRAM supply continued to exceed demand. And because 
of that, we expect pricing will continue to be favorable. For most LCDs, we 
expect pricing to stabilize as the market moves to a supply
-
demand balance. 
The hard drive market has moved to a supply
-
demand balance, and we 
expect marketing

Just a clarification, Pete. Did you say that 2/3 of the sequential gross margin 
decline was basically due to products? And did I hear that

clarify that? Because it seems like quite a rapid drop, and I'm just wondering 
how much conservatism is in your gross margin guidance. And then I have a 
follow

up for Tim afterwards.

Sure, Kulbinder, the 2/3 that I talked a
bout, the sequential decline, we see 
as being driven by a higher mix of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling 
the current lineup of the iPad or the current iPad lineup, and then a loss of 
leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. So those 3 factors w
e see 
driving 2/3 of the sequential decline.

Okay, great. And then, Tim, just a question on the enterprise side. You 
mentioned a couple of times how the iPad is being taken into new markets, 
new vertic
als, whether it's because of the price point of the innovation. I'm 
just wondering specifically what resources is Apple dedicating to have a 
much more direct relationship with the enterprise? Can you speak on what's 
changed in the last 6 or 12 months and w
hat you think you need to do to 
become a more credible or significant enterprise player?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Initially, our focus was on working with the Fortune 500 and the Global 500 
to get the iPad certified for their particular enterprise. And I'm pleased 
to 
report that 94% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPads and 75% 
of the Global 500 are testing or deploying the iPad. So these numbers are 
just off the charts for a product that's only 24 months old. And so we are 
moving our focus away from thi
s and focusing on penetration within these 
accounts. Peter alluded to some of the wins that we have had in the 
--
 
his 
opening comments. The incredible things about these are that they span 
across many verticals, through government, through education, and m
any 
different functions within the enterprise. It's absolutely the most broad
-
based product I have ever seen in my whole career in terms of adoption rate 
into the enterprise. And so yes, this means that we're applying more 
resources in Fes [ph] and salespe
ople to interact directly with these

Chris, are you there?

Hello? Can you hear me?
 
Nancy Paxton
 
Yes, we can.

Okay, sorry about that. If I take your revenue guidance an
d the comments 
you made around gross margin at face value, it seems to imply that you 
expect iPhone unit sales to be down about 10 million units quarter

on
-
quarter. First, is that in the right ballpark? And secondly, are you just being 
conservative with re
spect to the outlook? Or have you seen a change in the 
end demand environment for the phone?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Chris, let me sort of go in reverse order. We are incredibly confident in our 
business, our strategy and what we're doing. When we give you guida
nce, 
we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. And 
finally, we do expect a sequential decline in iPhone sales driven by the fact 
that we built 2.6 million units of channel inventory in the March quarter, 
which we needed to do. W
e're now within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks, 
and we entered the March quarter with significant backlog, as we talked 
about, in January. And we're able to fulfill that and launch 20 countries in 
the month of January. So 

-
 
we have immense confidence in
 
what we're 
doing and are very pleased with the way our business is performing.

up, if I could, on iPad. It is supply constrained across many geos, as 
you talked about. Is there a specific compo
nent issue? Do you have visibility 
on resolution? When do you expect to be able to meet demand in the iPad?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
It's hard to answer meet the demand. What I'm confident about, however, is 
that we will be able to supply a significant number of iP
ads during the 
quarter, and I feel very, very confident about that. It's tough to know 
precisely that it will balance until you get there, but I'm very confident with 
the improving supply and that the total number will be very significant.

esult, we set new all
-
time records for Mac, iPhone and iPad sales in the September quarter, and 
we are thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in 
Apple's history.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $20.34 billion, an increase of more than $8
.1 
billion over the prior September quarter's result, representing growth of 
67%. The very strong growth was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, 
the tremendous popularity of iPad and our best Mac quarter ever.
 
Operating margin was $5.45 billion, repre
senting 26.8% of revenue. Net 
income was $4.31 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings 
record by $930 million and represented 70% growth over the year
-
ago 
quarter's earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $4.64.
 
Turning 
to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products 
and services. We set a new quarterly record with sales of almost 3.9 million 
Macs, exceeding the previous record established in the June quarter by over 
400,000. This represents 27% yea
r
-
over
-
year growth, more than double 
IDC's latest published estimate of 11% growth for the market overall in the 
September quarter.
 
We experienced strong double
-
digit growth in both Mac desktop and portable 
categories led by very strong sales of iMac which
 
was updated in July and 
the continued popularity of the MacBook Pro and MacBook. Mac growth was 
strong in each of our geographic segments, led by Asia
-
Pacific at 56% year
-
over
-
year and Japan at 49%. We began and ended the quarter with between 
three and fo
ur weeks of Mac channel inventory.
 
Moving to our music products, we sold nearly 9.1 million iPods compared to 
10.2 million in the year
-
ago quarter. In September, we announced a great 
new lineup of iPods for the holiday season, including our redesigned iPod
 
Shuffle featuring clickable buttons, the reinvented iPod Nano with multi
-
touch and the new iPod touch with Retina display and FaceTime video 
calling.
 
iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based 
on the latest monthly data publ
ished by NPD. iPod also continues to be the 
top selling MP3 player and gained share internationally year
-
over
-
year in 
most of the countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. 
We remain within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod c
hannel 
inventory on a look
-
back basis.
 
The iTunes Store also had another strong quarter with revenue over $1 
billion. In September, we launched iTunes 10, including a number of new 
features such as $0.99 TV rentals, AirPlay wireless music playback and Ping
, 
which offers social music discovery to millions of iTunes users in 23 
countries. We also introduced new Apple TV which provides a simple way to 
watch movies and TV shows on your HDTV for the breakthrough price of just 
$99.
 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone.
 
We were extremely pleased to have sold 14.1 
million iPhones compared to just under 7.4 million in the previous 
September quarter. This represents 91% year
-
over
-
year growth and is well 
ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global s
mart 
phone market overall in the September quarter.
 
Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessories sales was $8.82 
billion during the quarter compared with $4.61 billion in the year
-
ago 
quarter, an increase of 92%. The sales value of iPhones alone 
was about 
$8.6 billion which yields an ASP of about $610.
 
At the end of the September quarter, we had iPhone distribution through 
166 carriers in 89 countries. We continue to experience very strong year
-
over
-
year growth, particularly in Asia, Europe and Ja
pan where iPhone sales 
more than doubled year
-
over
-
year. We were very happy to be shipping 
iPhone 4 in China as of the last day of the September quarter, and we've 
been very pleased with the customer response to date.
 
Last month, J.D. Power and Associates 
announced that for the fourth 
consecutive time, Apple ranks highest in its survey of customer satisfaction 
among manufacturers of smart phones, citing particularly strong 
performance and ease of operation, operating system, features and physical 
design.
 
Ad
option of iPhone within the enterprise continues to accelerate. In fact, 
since we've shipped iPhone 4, we've seen extraordinary growth from 60% to 
more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies deploying or piloting iPhone. 
Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone t
o their approved device list 
worldwide.
 
Most recently, Fortune 500 companies like Procter & Gamble, General 
Electric, Pfizer, Allstate, and Cardinal Health and Global 500 accounts such 
as Aviva Group, Total, Novartis, Roche and Sanofi
-
Aventis have made iPh
one 
available to their employees.
 
We ended the quarter with about 3.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a 
sequential increase of about 825,000 to support the launch of iPhone 4. We 
continue to have a sizeable backlog and believe we could have sold even
 
more iPhones if we had been able to supply them.
 
Turning to iPad, we're thrilled with its momentum. In just the second quarter 
of availability, we sold almost 4.2 million iPads with distribution in 26 
countries by the end of the September quarter. We're s
eeing great 
enthusiasm for iPad from consumers, educators and businesses.
 
Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an 
impressive rate. Since the launch of iPad, over 65% of the Fortune 100 is 
already deploying or piloting iPad. Some
 
recent examples of companies 
approving iPad include, Procter & Gamble, Lowes, Hyatt, NBC Universal and 
Novartis.
 
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the 
quarter was $2.8 billion. The sales value of iPads alone was about $2.7 
billion, which yields an ASP of about $645. We were able to increase the 
supply of iPads over the course of the quarter, building channel inventory by 
about 500,000 units to end the quarter with between three and four weeks 
of channel inventory below our t
arget range of four to six weeks.
 
We are expanding U.S. iPad distribution to include Wal
-
Mart, Target, Verizon 
and AT&T stores. We are also expanding distribution internationally.
 
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed cumulative iOS device 
sa
les by 125 million last month. During the September quarter, we released 
iOS 4.1, which builds on the innovations of iOS 4 bringing FaceTime video 
calling, multi
-
tasking, folders and Game Center to iPod Touch in addition to 
iPhone customers.
 
And in Novembe
r, we plan to release iOS 4.2 which will bring many of the 
great new features of iOS 4 to iPad. iOS 4.2 will also include AirPrint, Apple's 
new printing architecture that automatically finds printers on local networks 
and enables printing from iOS devices 
over Wi
-
Fi without the need to install 
drivers or download software.
 
The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success. There are now over 
200,000 registered iOS developers who continue to bring outstanding and 
creative new apps to the iOS 
platform, including over 65,000 game and 
entertainment titles and over 30,000 apps designed specifically for iPad.
 
And we launched iAd in July, which provides marketers with the ability to 
place interactive ads in popular apps for iPhone, iPod Touch and iP
ad. We 
were very happy with results so far. Customers are loving the media
-
rich 
ads and marketers are very pleased with viewer engagement.
 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which had a record
-
breaking 
quarter. Retail revenue was $3.57 billio
n compared to $2.04 billion in the 
year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 75%. Our stores sold a record 874,000 
Macs compared to 670,000 Macs in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 
30%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter 
were to
 
customers who had never owned a Mac before.
 
We opened 24 stores during the September quarter, 16 of which were 
outside the United States, including spectacular stores in Beijing, Shanghai, 
London and Paris. Our new Beijing and Shanghai stores opened on th
e last 
day of the quarter, and first
-
day sales from both stores exceeded all 
previous store openings. Our four China stores are our highest traffic stores 
in the world and are among our highest performing.
 
We also entered our eleventh country, with the ope
ning of stores in 
Barcelona and Madrid. That brings us to a total of 317 stores worldwide as at 
the end of the quarter, with 84 of them outside the United States. With an 
average of 301 stores opened during the September quarter, average 
revenue per store 
was $11.8 million compared to $7.8 million in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 52%.
 
Retail segment margin was $917 million compared to $564 million in the 
year
-
ago quarter. We hosted a record 74.5 million visitors in our stores 
during the quarter compa
red to 45.9 million visitors in the year
-
ago quarter, 
an increase of 62%.
 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2011, we see great opportunity to continue our 
retail growth with our focus on international expansion. In total, we expect 
to open 40 to 50 stores in our 
fiscal 2011 with over 50% of them outside the 
United States. We will also begin replacing several stores in the United 
States to get them right
-
sized for Apple's current product line and to meet 
our service goals.
 
Total company gross margin was 36.9%, whic
h was 190 basis points above 
our guidance. About two
-
thirds of this favorability was driven by lower 
commodity and other costs, and the remainder was mostly attributable to a 
better
-
than
-
planned mix of iPhone sales.
 
Operating expenses were $2.07 billion an
d included $185 million in stock
-
based compensation expense. OI&E was $14 million and the tax rate for the 
quarter was 21%, about five points below our guidance, largely a result of 
two factors. First, we had a higher mix of foreign earnings than we planne
d. 
Second, we had some discrete one
-
time tax benefits in the quarter as well. 
Our tax rate for fiscal 2010 was about 24.5%.
 
Turning to cash, our cash flow short term and long term marketable 
securities totaled $51 billion at the end of the September quarte
r compared 
to $45.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase of $5.2 billion. 
Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. The September quarter was the 
culmination of a monumental year for Apple. In fiscal 2010, we launched 
several new Macs; est
ablishing record sales of over $13.6 million and 
achieving 31% year
-
over
-
year sales growth, significantly outpacing the 
growth of the overall pc market.
 
We introduced the tremendously popular iPhone 4 with breakthrough 
features including FaceTime and Retin
a display fueling full
-
year sales of 40 
million iPhones, an increase of 93% over fiscal 2009. We launched the 
groundbreaking iPad, selling nearly 7.5 million to delighted customers in two 
quarters alone. We also brought great new features to iOS and iTunes
, and 
continue to innovate with completely new designs for iPod.
 
And as a result, we generated record revenue of over $65 billion, an 
increase of over $22 billion year
-
over
-
year or 52%. Earnings of $14 billion 
grew even faster at 70% year
-
over
-
year. To put
 
this growth in a 
perspective, in fiscal 2010, Apple generated almost five times the revenue 
and more than 10 times the earnings it did just five years earlier in fiscal 
2005.
 
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook 
which
 
includes the types of forward
-
looking information that Nancy referred 
to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion 
compared to $15.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect 
gross margins to be about 36% reflectin
g approximately $52 million related 
to stock
-
based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.325 
billion including about $250 million related to stock
-
based compensation.
 
We expect OI&E to be about $65 million. And we expect the tax rate to be 
ab
out 25.5%. We're targeting EPS of about $4.80. In closing, we're thrilled 
with our record September quarter and fiscal year 2010 results. We're very 
enthusiastic about our innovative product line
-
up and our significant 
opportunities for growth as we head i
nto fiscal 2011.
 
And we remain extremely confident in our new product pipeline. Before 
taking your questions, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Steve 
Jobs.
 
Steve Jobs
 
As most of you know, I don't usually participate in Apple's earnings calls 
s
ince you are all in such capable hands with Peter and Tim. But I just 
couldn't help dropping by for our first $20 billion quarter. I would like to chat 
about a few things and then stay for the rest of the Q&A if that's alright.
 
First, let me discuss iPhone
. We sold 14.1 million iPhones in the quarter 
which represents a 91% unit growth over the year
-
ago quarter and was well 
ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global 
smartphone market in the September quarter. And it handily beat RI
M's 
12.1 million Blackberry's sold in their most recent quarter ending in August. 
We've now passed RIM, and I don't seem them catching up with us in the 
foreseeable future. They must move beyond their area of strength and 
comfort into the unfamiliar territ
ory of trying to become a software platform 
company.
 
I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform 
and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform 
after iOS and Android. With 300,000 apps on Appl
e's App Store, RIM has a 
high mountain ahead of them to climb.
 
Well, what about Google? Last week, Eric Schmidt reiterated that they are 
activating 200,000 Android devices per day. And have around 90,000 apps 
in their App Store. For comparison, Apple has a
ctivated around 275,000 iOS 
devices per day on average for the past 30 days with a peak of almost 
300,000 iOS devices per day on a few of those days. And Apple has 300,000 
apps on its App Store.
 
Unfortunately, there is no solid data on how many Android pho
nes are 
shipped each quarter. We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting 
the number of Android handsets they ship each quarter. But today that just 
isn't the case. Gartner reported that around 10 million Android phones were 
shipped in the June qu
arter and we await to see if iPhone or Android was the 
winner in this most recent quarter.
 
Google loves to characterize Android as open, and iOS and iPhone as closed. 
We find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the real difference between our 
two approach
es. The first thing most of us think about when we hear the 
work open is Windows which is available on a variety of devices. Unlike 
Windows, however, where most pc's have the same user interface and run 
the same app, Android is very fragmented. Many Androi
d OEMs, including 
the two largest, HTC and Motorola install proprietary user interfaces to 
differentiate themselves from the commodity Android experience. The users 
will have to figure it all out. Compare this with iPhone, where every handset 
works the sam
e.
 
Twitter client, Twitter Deck, recently launched their app for Android. They 
reported that they had to contend with more than 100 different versions of 
Android software on 244 different handsets. The multiple hardware and 
software iterations present deve
lopers with a daunting challenge. Many 
Android apps work only on selected Android handsets running selected 
Android versions. And this is for handsets that have been shipped less than 
12 months ago. Compare this with iPhone, where there are two versions of
 
the software, the current and the most recent predecessor to test against.
 
In addition to Google's own app marketplace, Amazon, Verizon and 
Vodafone have all announced that they are creating their own app stores for 
Android. So there will be at least four
 
app stores on Android, which 
customers must search among to find the app they want and developers will 
need to work with to distribute their apps and get paid. This is going to be a 
mess for both users and developers. Contrast this with Apple's integrated
 
App Store, which offers users the easiest
-
to
-
use largest app store in the 
world, preloaded on every iPhone. Apple's App Store has over three times as 
many apps as Google's marketplace and offers developers' one
-
stop 
shopping to get their apps to market ea
sily and to get paid swiftly.
 
Even if Google were right, and the real issue is closed versus open, it is 
worthwhile to remember that open systems don't always win. Take 
Microsoft's PlaysForSure music strategy, which use the PC model, which 
Android uses as 
well, of separating the software components from the 
hardware components. Even Microsoft finally abandoned this open strategy 
in favor of copying Apple's integrated approach with their Zoom Player, 
unfortunately leaving their OEMs empty
-
handed in the proce
ss. Google 
flirted with this integrated approach with their Nexus One phone.
 
In reality, we think the open versus closed argument is just a smokescreen 
to try and hide the real issue, which is, what's best for the customer, 
fragmented versus integrated. We
 
think Android is very, very fragmented 
and becoming more fragmented by the day. And as you know, Apple's 
strives for the integrated model so that the user isn't forced to be the 
systems integrator.
 
We see tremendous value in having Apple rather than our u
sers' be the 
systems integrator. We think this is a huge strength of our approach 
compared to Google's. When selling to users who want their devices to just 
work, we believe integrated will trump fragmented every time. And we also 
think our developers can 
be more innovative if they can target a singular 
platform rather than a hundred variants. They can put their time into 
innovative new features rather than testing on hundreds of different 
handsets.
 
So we are very committed to the integrated approach, no ma
tter how many 
times Google tries to characterize it as closed. And we are confident that it 
will triumph over Google's fragmented approach, no matter how many times 
Google tries to characterize it as open.
 
Second, I'd like to comment on the 
avalanche of tablets poised to enter the 
market in the coming months. First, it appears to be just a handful of 
credible entrants, not exactly an avalanche. Second, almost all of them use 
seven
-
inch screens as compared to iPad's near 10
-
inch screen. Let's 
start 
there. One naturally thinks that a seven
-
inch screen would offer 70% of the 
benefits of a 10
-
inch screen. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. The 
screen measurements are diagonal, so that a seven
-
inch screen is only 45% 
as large as iPad's 10
-
i
nch screen. You heard me right; just 45% as large
 
If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an 
imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen, the screens on the 
seven
-
inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iP
ad display. 
This size isn't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion.
 
Well, one could increase the resolution of the display to make up for some of 
the difference. It is meaningless, unless your tablet also includes sandpaper, 
so that the user
 
can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the 
present size. Apple's done extensive user
-
testing on touch interfaces over 
many years, and we really understand this stuff. There are clear limits of 
how close you can physically place elements on a
 
touch screen before users 
cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one of the key reasons we 
think the 10
-
inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great 
tablet apps.
 
Third, every tablet user is also a smartphone user. No tablet can
 
compete 
with the mobility of a smartphone, its ease of fitting into your pocket or 
purse, its unobtrusiveness when used in a crowd. Given that all tablet users 
will already have a smartphone in their pockets, giving up precious display 
area to fit a table
t in our pockets is clearly the wrong tradeoff. The seven
-
inch tablets are tweeners, too big to compete with a smartphone and too 
small to compete with an iPad.
 
Fourth, almost all of these new tablets use Android software, but even 
Google is telling the ta
blet manufacturers not to use their current release, 
Froyo, for tablets, and to wait for a special tablet release next year. What 
does it mean when your software suppliers does not (inaudible) to use their 
software in your tablet? And what does it mean whe
n you ignore them and 
use it anyway?
 
Fifth, iPad now has over 35,000 apps on the App Store. This new crop of 
tablets will have near zero.
 
And sixth and last, our potential competitors are having a tough time coming 
close to iPad's pricing, even with their 
far smaller, far less expensive 
screens. The iPad incorporates everything we have learnt about building high 
value products from iPhones, iPods and Macs. We create our own A4 chip, 
our own software, our own battery chemistry, our own enclosure, our own 
eve
rything. And this results in an incredible product at a great price. The 
proof of this will be in the pricing of our competitor's products which will 
likely offer less for more.
 
These are among the reasons we think the current crop of seven
-
inch tablets 
ar
e going to be DOA, Dead on Arrival. Their manufacturers will learn the 
painful lesson that their tablets are too small and increase the size next 
year, thereby abandoning both customers and developers who jumped on 
the seven
-
inch bandwagon with an orphan p
roduct. Sounds like lots of fun 
ahead.
 
So thank you, and let me turn it back to Peter for the Q&A session.

I had two quick ones, if I could. One is the supply constraints on iPad. Could 
you talk about how severe the supply constraints are on that product and 
how quickly you expect it to improve? And then a follow
-
up for Peter on 
gross margin please.
 
Tim Cook
 
R

September with the limited number of distribution points in the 26 countries 
where we sold the iPad. And so we exited the quarter in a supply position 
that allows us to expand distributi
on prior to the holidays as we've planned 
for sometime. And hopefully you've seen some of the recent announcements 
of added partners in the United States. We're also expanding internationally, 
and will be launching additional countries as the quarter goes 
on.
 
Richard Gardner

Citi
 
And then Peter, you mentioned several sequential tailwinds for gross margin 
during the September quarter. Could you talk about the headwinds in the 
quarter and what impact they had on gross margin sequentially, please?
 
Peter Oppe
nheimer
 
I'm sorry, Rich, for the September quarter?
 
Richard Gardner 
-
 
Citi
 
For the September quarter, yes.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
In our last conference call, we talked about several things that we thought 
would cause margins to come down some. And all those th
ings did play out, 
but margins came down actually about half of what we thought that they 
would. And we did a bit better in the quarter because commodity and other 
costs were better than we thought, and we sold more iPhones than we had 
planned to.

Piper Jaffray
 
If you can talk a little bit about the iPad opportunity you went through, and 
gave us some good insight in terms of the competitive landscape. But as 
analysts, we're here kind of tryin
g to put some estimates out there and 
we're not doing a great job of trying to figure out this trajectory in the iPad.
 
Can you help us understand how you think about the business a year or two 
years down the road in terms of size of your overall 
business, impact on 
enterprise, education, anything you can give to help us on that front? And 
then a follow
-
up question.
 
Steve Jobs
 
Well, the iPad is clearly going to affect notebook computers. And I think the 
iPad proves, it's not a question of if, it's 
a question of when. And I think a lot 
of development and progress that will occur over the next few years. But 
we're already seeing tremendous interest in iPad from education, and much 
to my surprise, from business.
 
We haven't pushed it real hard in busine
ss, and it's being grabbed out of our 
hands. And I talk to people everyday in all kinds of businesses that are using 
iPads, all the way from Boards of Directors that are shipping iPads around 
instead of board books, down to nurses and doctors in hospitals 
and other 
large and small businesses.
 
So the more time that passes, the more I am convinced that we've got a 
tiger by the tail here. And this is a new model of computing which we've 
already got tens of millions of people trained on with the iPhone. And tha
t 
lends itself to lots of different aspects of life both personal, educational and 
business.
 
So, I see it as very general purpose, and I see it as really big. And the 
timing, one could argue about the timing endlessly, but I don't think one 
could argue tha
t it's going to happen anymore.

Do you think this could be your second

biggest business in iPhone?

Peter, just one quick question. Our tracks were that yo
u had about three 
weeks lead
-
time in most of your countries on the iPhone throughout the 
quarter. You mentioned you could have sold more iPhones. How do you think 
about what the true demand could have been in the quarter?
 
Tim Cook
 
I think that which you're
 
referring to is the quote that's on the Apple Online 
Store. What I would say is that the demand in all countries is absolutely 
staggering. And at this point I can't predict when supply will meet demand. I 
feel great about our ability to move the supply an
d the sales up from an 8 
million kind of number to over 14 million. But it's clear, last quarter that 
wasn't enough. And we are obviously working on that, but it will take some 
time to increase further.
 
Gene Munster 
-
 
Piper Jaffray
 
Were you more supply
-
con
strained in the September quarter versus the 
June quarter? Totally different dynamics in the quarter, but any perspective 
on the two quarters?
 
Tim Cook
 
It's clear that the iPhone 4 and the announcement of iPhone 4 and the 
demand for it took the demand to a
n entirely different level. And we had 
anticipated a very different level, but it's even higher than that.

From RBC Capital Markets, we'll go to Mike Abramsky.

Steve, appreciate your commentary. You know, you ar
e the tablet market 
right now. And this is I think the second time now you've come on to talk 
about or certainly at one time during your presentation to talk about 
competition. And I am just wondering, if much like Apple encroaching on 
whims, monopoly and 
enterprise, if you think that Apple's going to able to 
sustain share growth for tablets amid some of those new competitive 
headwinds?
 
Some of those players may try different things and strategies like tethering 
and Flash, multi
-
tasking, less content and ap
p restrictions and subsidized 
pricing. And just wondered if you think that, that may create itself a more 
fragmented market and how you see that rolling out with regard to Apple?
 
Steve Jobs
 
I have a hard time envisioning what those strategies you 
mentioned are. I 
mean, in terms of pricing, so far, the little we've seen, the tablets with far 
less functionality are having a hard time matching us in price. Flash hasn't 
presented any problem at all. As you know, most of the video on the web is 
now avai
lable in HTML 5. And having the iTunes media store and over 
35,000 apps on the App Store for iPad dwarfs anything else. And we think 
we have a very good product here that's going to be hard to match, and 
we're not done. We're working on a lot of things for
 
the future.
 
So I don't know exactly what these strategies are. And we've priced iPad 
pretty aggressively. So we're out to win this one.

And just lastly, the smartphones, do you see that as a zero sum game?
 
Steve Jobs
 
We
ll, as you know the largest market of phones today around the world are 
non smartphones. And so over the next several years, many of those non
-
smartphones are going to convert to smartphones. And the pie is going to 
continue to grow, and I think there will
 
be room for some number of 
companies to be successful. But eventually, as most of those phones do 
convert to smartphones, it will turn into a zero sum game or at least a lot 
closer to that.
 
But I think right now it's a battle for developers and a battle f
or the 
mindshare of developers and a battle for the mindshare of customers. And 
right now iPhone and Android are winning that battle.

First, for Peter, can you just t
alk a little bit about gross margins? You have 
gross margin guidance of 36. With component prices still favorable and 
probably more iPhone's being sold sequentially, can you just talk about why 
margins would go down sequentially, which seems also that you 
released the 
revenue on the bumper program? And then I have a follow
-
up for Steve, if 
you don't mind.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Ben, in providing our guidance we thought about each of those factors that 
you cited, and we do see a small sequential decline. This has
 
been primarily 
driven by a higher than expected mix of new iPod's that we just recently 
announced, and more iPad sales, and which as Steve said, we've been very 
aggressive with our pricing and are delivering great value to customers. So 
it's the higher mi
x of those on a sequential basis that I see impacting the 
gross margin slightly.

Okay. And then Steve, can you just comment on how your hobby is doing, 
Apple TV? You took the hard drive out of there, and it seems like Ap
ple is 
moving more to a streaming model work, you know, potentially a lot of other 
things, and I was just wondering what your thoughts were for the Apple TV, 
maybe that kind of business model proliferating into more products. But I 
was wondering how Apple 
TV is doing and what's your thoughts going 
forward?
 
Steve Jobs
 
Well, we don't talk about unannounced products, but I'm happy to tell you 
what I know about Apple TV. We have gone to streaming model on Apple 
TV; it's complete streaming. So all the content is
 
rented from the iTunes 
store or is streamed from your computer, or soon to be streamed from your 
iPhone or iPad with AirPlay. And so how is our new model of Apple TV doing? 
Well, I can report that in just a very short amount of time we've already sold 
a q
uarter million of them, over 250,000, and we're thrilled with that.
 
I think that it's a great product and I think its $99 price point is very 
enticing. And I think when we get the AirPlay stuff in place before the end of 
this year, it's going to give anoth
er big reason for people to buy it. So we're 
really happy with how it's turned out.

The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley
 
Katy Huberty

Morgan Stanley
 
First, for Peter, how much of the sequential decline in gross margi
n related 
to the iPhone in the September quarter and particularly the bumper 
program?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Katy, we've recorded a revenue deferral of just over $100 million in the 
September quarter for the bumper program. We would expect to record that 
in rev
enue in the December quarter. We did ship a number of bumpers in 
the September quarter, and that is reflected in our gross margin, as is the 
number that we expect to ship in the December quarter. That's reflected in 
our guidance as well.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Mor
gan Stanley
 
And just to be clear, is the iPhone the product segment that dropped the 
most sequentially as it relates to gross margins? I guess people are just 
asking what drove the sequential down tick which we haven't seen for some 
time.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
You mean in the September quarter?
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Yes, in the September quarter.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Well again, this was not a surprise to us. And we, on our last conference call 
highlighted that we would have a higher mix of iPhone 4 
sales, and we were 
very aggressive with feature function there. So it had a different gross 
margin than its predecessor product. We also sold more iPads. Again, we 
were very aggressive there with our pricing. And we had the bumper 
program and some one
-
time
 
items that occurred in June that we said 
wouldn't occur in September.
 
So these were sort of the factors we saw bringing down gross margin. To 
some extent, each of them did occur in the September quarter, but we 
ended up doing about 50% better than we thou
ght as a result of the 
commodity market and selling more iPhones.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
And then Steve, just as a follow
-
up. It seems like you fundamentally believe 
that Apple should be able to out
-
ship Android if you add up all the mobile 
devices 
over time. What are the key risks you're managing the company to 
make sure you don't lose that lead, whether it's distribution, or pricing, or 
features? What do you think the biggest risks are that you need to watch 
carefully?
 
Steve Jobs
 
Well, our goal is 
to make the best devices in the world. It's not to be the 
biggest; as you know, Nokia is the biggest. And we admire them for being 
able to ship the number of handsets that they do. But we don't aspire to be 
like them. They are good at being like them. We w
ant to be like us, and we 
want to make the best ones.
 
So in our part of the market, Android is our biggest competitor. They out
-
shipped us in the June quarter as we were transitioning to iPhone 4. They 
out
-
shipped us for the first time according to Gartner
's numbers, which we 
think are pretty accurate. And so we're waiting to find out what happened in 
this quarter. We'll find out. I don't know how we'll find out, but Gartner will 
put out some new numbers, and maybe others will, so one of these days 
we'll ev
entually learn.
 
And I imagine we'll be competing with them for quite some time. But we 
have very different approaches. And we believe in our approach very 
strongly is providing users products that just work. And we think there is lots 
of users that want th
at in the world, and their approach is very different 
than that. And there maybe lots of users that want that their approach as 
well. But we're going to pursue ours and we think that's the winning 
approach in the end.
 
Operator
 
And that will come from Toni 
Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
 
Toni Sacconaghi

Sanford Bernstein
 
I guess this is for both Steve and Tim. I wanted to just better understand 
your aspirations for iPhone and iPad. Tim, I think I've heard you say, ""Look, 
we think about the Mac business 
as being one where we make the best 
products, but we're competing against kind of strong income and power in 
Microsoft. And we don't aspire to have high market share.""
 
In your iPod business it was kind of the opposite. You had very high volume, 
you drove p
rice points down to entry points in the marketplace. And you 
have more than 50% market share globally. I think when we've talked about 
it in the past, you've actually said that you view the iPhone business as 
being more akin to the iPod business in terms o
f your aspiration.
 
Steve, it sounded like that wasn't really consistent with what you said. You 
said very clearly, we don't want to be Nokia, we just to want to make good 
phone. So perhaps, you can help me better understand how we should think 
about your a
spiration for both the iPhone and the iPad. Steve, you also 
made a comment about seven inch screens aren't going to cut it, and 
implying that you're not going to go down to those lower price points.
 
Is your aspiration for iPhone and iPad to be volume playe
rs and market 
leaders? Or is it simply to make good products? And if you have smaller 
share like you do in Mac, that's fine. Can you help me with that, please?
 
Steve Jobs
 
Sure, and I'll let Tim say what he's going to say too. First of all, Nokia makes 
$50 
handsets, and we don't know how to make a great smartphone for $50. 
We're not smart enough to figure that one out yet, but believe me I'll let you 
know, when we do. So our goal is to make a really breakthrough great 
product. Make the best products in every
 
industry that we compete in and to 
drive the cost down, while constantly making the products better at the 
same time. That's what we did with iPod.
 
We updated our products many times every year, with better functionality 
oftentimes at the same price, and 
sometimes at a lower price. And it was 
this relentless improvement, and in some cases a lower price that was able 
to beat our competition and yield the market share that it did. And as you 
know, we have a very low market share in the phone market in the si
ngle 
digits, in terms of all the handsets. And we have a very high market share 
now in tablets, because we're the first mover.
 
But we don't think about it that way. The reason we wouldn't make a seven 
inch tablet isn't because we don't want to hit a price 
point, it's because we 
don't think you can make a great tablet with a seven inch screen. We think 
it's too small to express the software that people want to put on these 
things. And we think as a software driven company, we think about the 
software strateg
ies first.
 
And we know that software developers they're not going to deal real well 
with all these different size products, when they have to redo their software, 
every time a screen size changes. And they're not going to deal well with 
products where they
 
can't put enough elements on the screen to build the 
kind of apps they want to build.
 
So when we make decisions on seven inch tablets, it's not about cost, it's 
about the value of the product when you factor in the software. You see 
what I'm getting at? S
o we're all about making the best products at 
aggressive prices. And that's what we will do and that's what we've done 
with the iPod, and that's what we will do with the iPad as well.
 
Toni Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Tim, maybe you want to 
comment, if I could push you on that Steve. So if 
the market starts to move towards somewhat lower functionality 
smartphones in that migration of non
-
smartphones to smartphones that you 
talked about. If the market starts to move to dramatically lower price
 
points, 
you feel you can't make an appropriate product that is good at those price 
points, you will cede share under those circumstances. Do I hear you 
correctly?
 
Steve Jobs
 
You're looking at it wrong. You're looking at it as a hardware person in a 
fragme
nted world. You're looking at it as a hardware manufacturer that 
doesn't really know much about software, who doesn't think about an 
integrated product, but assumes the software will somehow take care of 
itself. And you're sitting around saying, ""Well, how
 
can we make this 
cheaper? Well, we can put on a smaller screen on it and a slower processor, 
and less memory."" And you assume that the software will somehow just 
come alive on this product that you're dreaming of, but it won't. Because 
these app developer
s have taken advantage of the products that came 
before with faster processors, with larger screens, with more capabilities 
that they can take advantage of to make better apps for customers.
 
And it's a hard one because it throws you right back into the 
beginning of 
that chicken and egg problem again to change all the assumptions on those 
developers. Most of them will not follow you, most of them will say, ""I'm 
sorry, but I'm not going to go back and write a watered down version of my 
app just because you
've got this phone that you can sell for $50 less and 
you're begging me to write software for it.""
 
Toni Sacconaghi

Sanford Bernstein
 
One more if I may, please, Steve? You now have more than $50 billion in 
cash. You're generating more than $20 billion a y
ear in cash; it rests very 
comfortably on your balance sheet, earning less than 1% interest. What is 
your aspiration for that cash? And why are you not more open to returning 
some of that cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividend?
 
Steve Jobs
 
Of course that's been suggested to us. We strongly believe that one or more 
very strategic opportunities may come along that we're in a unique position 
to take advantage of because of our strong cash position. And I think we've 
demonstrated a really stron
g track record of being very disciplined with the 
use of our cash. We don't let it burn a hole in our pocket, we don't allow it to 
motivate us to do stupid acquisitions.
 
And so I think that we'd like to continue to keep our powder dry because we 
do feel th
at there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future. 
That's the biggest reason. And there are other reasons as well that we could 
go into. But that's the biggest one.

From Cross Research, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.

C

Steve and Tim, could you talk a little bit about the corporate opportunity? 
And what I'm looking for is sort how you're thinking about Apple as it's been 
positioned over the last several years, sort of more of a consumer focused, 
SMB focused 
company, but clearly there is a huge opportunity here with the 
iPad and the iPhone and probably at some point the Macs into the corporate 
world.
 
So how do you think about your position from a marketing standpoint, a 
sales standpoint? Any changes you need t
o make, or how are you sort of 
addressing that?
 
Tim Cook
 
On the iPad, there have been some comments about this earlier, but just to 
give you some stats here, about two
-
thirds of the Fortune 100 are deploying 
or piloting iPad. And I don't know about you, bu
t I've never seen an 
adoption like this in my life in enterprise. Enterprise is historically much 
slower moving on adoption. We're also seeing the iPad begin to pick up 
interest in K12 which is another market that historically adopts very, very 
slowly. And
 
so the early data points look great. And as a matter of fact, we 
have built and are building additional capacity internally in the sales 
organizations, to call on businesses and obviously we have a huge amount of 
sales people already there calling on educ
ation institutions.
 
We're also enabling in training our carrier partners to do the same. You 
probably saw a announcement last week with AT&T, and that's a direct 
result of customers wanting to buy the iPad on a postpaid type plan. And so 
we're putting a lo
t of energy in those. iPhone has followed a trajectory that 
gets into same kinds of numbers as I pointed on iPad where, or a little bit 
higher by now, is 85% of the Fortune 100 are deploying are deploying or 
piloting iPhone.
 
And so this isn't a hobby or so
mething we're doing lightly. We put enormous 
energy in the company, in engineering, in software to build a number of 
enterprise features in the OS. You've seen that, it gets better and better as 
we step through the different OS releases. And we're building
 
the sales 
capability for those groups as well. It's clear that both the phone and the 
iPad have an enormous opportunity.
 
The Mac is also increasingly getting pulled into an enterprise where the 
employees are able to select. And of course, this is a trend 
that we like to 
see, and that we think will continue in larger ways. But when people are 
given the choice, they would prefer a Mac, so Macs are being pulled in as 
well.
 
We don't have as much distribution effort on that, but as we see if it gets 
any larger,
 
we will move accordingly. The great thing is that we're 
maintaining our focus on the consumer, and the consumer is a forefront on 
thinking of all our products. And it's these consumers in the enterprise so to 
speak that are pulling these products in.
 
And 
so we're not developing two different lines like many companies do and 
have enterprise versions and consumer versions. This is another part of our 
simplistic approach to things that I think will pay us great dividend and is 
already starting to do so.

And I had a follow
-
up for Peter, I am getting substantial questions, as I am 
sure everybody on the call is, just about gross margin. So one of the 
questions I have is, as you're seeing the increase in volume, is there any 
kind of 
a change in terms of sort of the scale leverage you have from a 
manufacturing standpoint? I know you guided to lower gross margins, but 
the Street of course was higher?
 
So, just anything you can give us in terms of color on the gross margins with 
the iPhon
e 4 in terms of how that's panning out and how we should think 
about start up costs that were associated with, both that as well as the iPad, 
just any color would be great?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
We don't provide product specific gross margins but we are always
 
working 
aggressively to lower our costs whether it's the iPhone or any of our other 
products. I think we have a very good track record in this regard. And we 
were happy with our gross margins in the September quarter, they were 
ahead of what we thought. A
nd we see them being just down slightly in the 
December quarter as we ship more iPods where we've been quite aggressive 
and continue to ship more iPads as well.

And our next question will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.

I am interested in understanding demand from new carriers to take up 
iPhone 4 and whether or not you're seeing any pressure on subsidies as you 
look to expand your distribution networks on the phone business?

Chris, the 
pressure that I am getting is on supply. Virtually everyone we're 
doing business with wants more supply. So that's the pressure that I feel.
 
Chris Whitmore

Deutsche Bank
 
Can you give us some color, sorry if I missed this, I jumped on late, but 
some color
 
in terms of where you are from a number of carriers with iPhone 
4, how did you end the quarter? Do you have targets for the December 
quarter in terms of carrier penetration with existing relationships?
 
Tim Cook
 
We have, if you count at the country level, 
we have about 166 relationships 
that we ended the quarter with in about 89 countries. And so that's a 
significant expansion across from last year as we in many countries went 
from a single carrier relationship to more than one carrier.
 
The latest country t
hat we have done that in or that we've announced that in 
is Germany and we will be launching both with Vodafone and O2 together 
with our existing partner T
-
Mobile in Germany later this month.
 
Chris Whitmore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
And all 166 of the carriers have 
the phone 4 by year end, is that the target?
 
Tim Cook
 
With iPhone 4, we're in 85 of those 89 countries. And I believe that we will 
be in all 89 by the end of the year.
 
Chris Whitmore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
And what is your experience then when you've gone non
-
exc
lusive from a 
subsidy and margin standpoint on the phone, have you had to give anything 
up in the past?
 
Tim Cook
 
We don't give specific information out on the margins. But I think you can 
look at our ASPs and see that they've generally stayed above $600, a
nd 
that's despite opening up several markets from an exclusive market to a 
non
-
exclusive market.
 
Chris Whitmore

Deutsche Bank
 
Steve, you discussed competitors not matching Apple's price point so far on 
the tablet space. Why do you think you have an advan
tage on the price 
point for iPad versus the PC manufacturers?
 
Steve Jobs
 
Well, I think part of it is because we engineer so much of it ourselves. The 
A4 chip inside it is an Apple creation; everything, again, as I mentioned from 
the battery chemistry to th
e enclosures. And we've learned a lot. We've 
learned a lot from the miniaturization we've done on iPods and iPhones. And 
we're a very high volume consumer electronics manufacturer.
 
So I think we've learned a lot. We've developed a lot of our own components
 
where other have to buy them on the market with middlemen, getting their 
cut of things. I think we're systems architects and know how to build 
systems in a very efficient way. So I think this is a product we've been 
training for, for the last decade.

I'd now like to turn th
e call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory 
remarks.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Thank you, Nancy. We are thrilled to report the results of a tremendous 
quarter, generating the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's 
history. We established numerous 
new records during the quarter, including 
all
-
time highs for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud of 
these results and are extremely pleased with the momentum of our 
business.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $46.3 billion, representing year
-
over
-
year 
growth of 73%. The increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in 
iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, and was also aided by the inclusion of a 14th 
week in the quarter, which we indicated previously.
 
Operating margin was $17.3 billion, representing 37
.4% of revenue. Net 
income was $13.1 billion, increasing 118% over the prior December 
quarter's results, and equaling half of the net income generated in all of 
fiscal 2011. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of 
$13.87.
 
Turning to th
e details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products 
and services. We established a new all
-
time quarterly record with sales of 
5.2 million Macs, setting new records for both desktops and portables. Mac 
sales grew 26% year
-
over
-
year compared t
o IDC's latest published forecast 
of 0 growth for the market overall in the December quarter. While total Mac 
sales benefited from the 14th week, average weekly Mac sales were up 
strongly year
-
over
-
year across the quarter. Mac sales outgrew the market in 
e
ach of our geographies with particular strength in our Asia
-
Pacific segment 
where sales were up 58% year
-
over
-
year. The increase in Mac sales was 
fueled by very strong growth of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as 
the continued strong performance of iM
ac. We began and ended the quarter 
with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look
-
forward 
basis.
 
As we announced last month, the Mac App Store has been a great success 
with customers downloading over 100 million apps in less than a year. The
 
Mac App Store offers thousands of apps in education, games, graphics and 
design, lifestyle, productivity, utilities and other categories, and has rapidly 
become a favorite shopping destination for Mac software.
 
Moving to our music products. We sold 15.4 m
illion iPods compared to 19.4 
million in the year
-
ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our 
expectations and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods 
sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% 
based on t
he latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to 
be the top
-
selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest 
data published by GFK.
 
We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod 
channel inventory on a l
ook
-
forward basis. The iTunes Store generated 
record results with revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion. During the quarter, 
we launched iTunes music stores in Brazil as well as 27 other countries in 
Latin America and Europe, now offering a catalog of ove
r 20 million songs 
from major recording labels, as well as thousands of independent artists. 
And iTunes customers were amazingly busy on December 25, generating 
over 140 million downloads of apps and content that day.
 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We wer
e thrilled to sell a record 37 million 
iPhones compared to 16.2 million in the previous December quarter. This 
represents 128% year
-
over
-
year growth compared to 40% growth for the 
smartphone market overall in the December quarter, based on the latest 
publi
shed estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales 
growth in all of our segments, thanks primarily to the tremendous popularity 
of iPhone 4S.
 
Customers have been captivated by Siri, which let's them use their voices to 
send messages, place pho
ne calls, schedule appointments and more. Siri 
understands what users say, knows what they mean and helps them with 
everyday tasks and information requests. iPhone channel inventory 
increased sequentially by about 200k, leaving us with a little under 6 mil
lion 
iPhones in the channel at the end of the quarter, and below our target range 
of 4 to 6 weeks on a look
-
forward basis.
 
Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $24.4 
billion during the quarter compared to $10.5 billion in the year
-
ago quarter, 
an increase of 133%. Nearly all of the top companies in the Fortune 500 now 
approve and support iPhone on their networks. This includes companies in 
markets such as financial services, consumer products, transportation, 
healthcare and insuran
ce.
 
iPhone is changing the way companies across the globe use mobile devices 
for work. In addition to accessing e
-
mail, calendar and contacts, many of 
these companies are developing and deploying mission
-
critical iPhone apps 
to help improve productivity an
d give employees secure and immediate 
access to information anywhere. Many companies around the world have 
thousands of employees using iPhone and business apps. Some new 
examples include Royal Dutch Shell, Credit Suisse, Kimberly
-
Clark, St. Jude 
Medical, 
Providian, Teradata, Nike, [indiscernible] and Facebook. We were 
very pleased to begin shipping iPhone 4S in China and 21 additional 
countries earlier this month. iPhone 4S is now available in over 90 countries, 
making this our fastest iPhone rollout ever.
 
Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with record sales of 15.4 million iPads 
during the December quarter compared to 7.3 million in the year
-
ago 
quarter, an increase of 111%. iPad was extremely popular with holiday 
season buyers, and we remain very excit
ed about the potential for this 
market.
 
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the 
quarter increased by 99% year
-
over
-
year to over $9.1 billion compared to 
$4.6 billion in the year
-
ago quarter. iPad sales surpassed our expectatio
ns 
with sell
-
through exceeding sell
-
in by about 200,000 units. We exited the 
quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory on 
a look
-
forward basis.
 
iPad continues its unprecedented adoption in business. Nearly all of the top 
com
panies within major Fortune 500 markets including pharma, 
manufacturing, hospitality, consumer products, financial services, healthcare 
and retail are actively using iPad to improve workflows, business processes 
and customer engagements. We are delighted t
o learn how iPad enables 
businesses to change the way they work. Real estate agents at Coldwell 
Banker and Sotheby's access sales presentations and use custom iPad apps 
in the field. Retail chains such as Bed Bath & Beyond use iPads to deliver key 
business
 
metrics on the sales floor. Wineries are using iPads in their 
vineyards to call up weather data and soil profiles, record quality 
assessments and make decisions on the spot about whether to harvest their 
grapes. And in this past quarter, Chinese airline, 
EVA, has also deployed 
iPads to pilots and crew for flight manuals, documentation and training.
 
iPad is extremely popular with students, teachers and administrators as a 
wonderfully engaging and powerful tool for teaching and learning. Today, 1.5 
million i
Pads are already in use in education institutions, including over 
1,000 one
-
to
-
one deployments.
 
We were very pleased to announce iBooks 2 last week featuring iBook 
Textbooks to deliver educational content that is more interactive, current 
and portable than
 
ever from leading publishers, including Houghton Mifflin, 
McGraw
-
Hill and Pearson, as well as thousands of independent publishers. 
And with iBooks Author, anyone with a Mac can create iBook textbooks, 
cookbooks, picture books and more, and publish them to
 
Apple's iBook 
Store. And over 600,000 copies of iBooks Author have already been 
downloaded since last Thursday's announcement.
 
We were also happy to announce the all
-
new iTunes U App last week, 
allowing students using iPads to have access to the world's l
argest catalog of 
free educational content, along with over 20,000 education apps and 
hundreds of thousands of books in the iBookstore that can be used in their 
school curriculum. And as of today, over 3 million copies of iTunes U App 
have already been dow
nloaded.
 
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 315 million cumulative 
iOS device sales, selling more than 62 million in the December quarter. We 
were very pleased to launch iOS 5 and iCloud during the quarter. Customers 
are loving the new fea
tures of iOS 5, including Notification Center, iMessage 
and Reminders. And iCloud is off to a great start with more than 85 million 
customers signed up as of today. With iCloud, customers can store their 
music and photos and documents and keep their person
al information and 
content in sync across all their devices, automatically and seamlessly.
 
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 550,000 apps 
available, including 170,000 apps specifically for iPad. We are thrilled that by 
the end o
f this month, our developers will have earned over $4 billion 
cumulatively from App Store sales, including over $700 million in the 
December quarter alone.
 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record 
results. Revenue was $6
.1 billion, an increase of 59% over the prior year. 
The stores experienced very strong year
-
over
-
year growth in iPhone, iPad 
and Mac sales, establishing new records for all 3. iPhone sales were 
extremely robust, more than doubling year
-
over
-
year thanks pri
marily to the 
very successful launch of the iPhone 4S.
 
Sales of iPad were also up significantly year
-
over
-
year, thanks to continued 
strength of iPad 2 and strong holiday season buying. The stores also sold 1.1 
million Macs compared to 851,000 in the 
year
-
ago quarter. And about half 
the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers 
who had never owned a Mac before.
 
We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, including our spectacular new store 
at Grand Central, as well as 3 stores in
 
Europe, bringing us to a total of 361 
stores. With an average of 358 stores open, average revenue per store was 
$17.1 million compared to $12 million in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase 
of 43%.
 
Segment margin reached a new record of over $1.8 billion and
 
30.3% of 
retail revenue compared to $1 billion and 26.2% in the year
-
ago quarter. 
Store traffic reached new record levels with 110 million visitors compared to 
76 million visitors in the year
-
ago quarter, an increase of 45%. That 
translates to an average 
of almost 22,000 visitors per store per week, 
reflecting incredible interest in our stores and our products.
 
Our EasyPay checkout process has significantly enhanced our ability to 
handle such high customer traffic levels. And now, with personal pick up, 
cu
stomers can order Macs, iPods or iPads from the Apple online store and 
pick up most in
-
stock products within 1 hour at the Apple Retail Store of 
their choice, making shopping for Apple products that much easier and 
faster.
 
Total company gross margin was 44
.7%, which was 470 basis points higher 
than our guidance. About half of this difference was driven by lower 
commodity and other product costs. Another quarter was due to leverage on 
the higher revenue and some onetime items benefiting the quarter. And the 
remainder was due to better
-
than
-
expected mix largely from the record 
iPhone sales.
 
Operating expenses were $3.36 billion, and included $357 million in stock
-
based compensation expense. OI&E was $137 million, and the tax rate for 
the quarter was 25.25%.
 
Tu
rning to our cash. Our cash for short
-
term and long
-
term marketable 
securities totaled $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter compared 
to $81.6 billion at the end of September quarter, a sequential increase of 
$16 billion. About $64 billion of th
e cash was offshore at the end of the 
December quarter.
 
Cash flow from operations was over $17.5 billion. We are actively discussing 
uses of our cash balance and don't have anything specific to announce 
today. In the meantime, we continue to be very discip
lined with the cash 
and are not letting it burn a hole in our pockets.
 
As we move ahead into the March quarter, which will be 13
-
week quarter, 
I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward
-
looking 
information that Nancy referred to at
 
the beginning of the call.
 
We expect revenue to be about $32.5 billion, compared to $24.7 billion in 
the March quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 42%, 
reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock
-
based compensation 
expense. We 
expect OpEx to be about $3.05 billion, including about $350 
million related to stock
-
based compensation.
 
We expect OI&E to be about $125 million, and we expect the tax rate to be 
about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.50.
 
In closing, we are extreme
ly pleased with customer response to our products 
and the record
-
breaking results in the December quarter. We launched 
iPhone 4S to rave reviews, delivered iOS and iCloud to millions of customers 
and surpassed all previous records for quarterly iPhone, iPa
d and Mac sales. 
We are very proud to be delivering the strongest product lineup in Apple's 
history and we are extremely enthusiastic about our new product pipeline.
 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions]

Tim and Peter, can you describe the iPhone momentum as yo
u ended the 
quarter? And what is included for the iPhone in your guidance and your 
enthusiasm for the product as we head into the first half of the calendar 
year? Any more detail in metrics would be helpful.
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Sure, Ben. This is Tim. We were 
thrilled with the 37 million iPhones that we 
sold. It's up 128% against a market rate of growth of about 40%, according 
to IDC's latest projection. And this is substantially above the 20 million unit 
previous record. We would attribute it to a 
--
 
just a br
eathtaking customer 
reception of the iPhone 4S with iOS 5, and key features such as Siri and this 
incredible camera with advanced optics. Customers are absolutely loving this 
product. We also attribute it to 
--
 
we made a very bold bet entering the 
quarter 
as to what the demand would be. And as it turns out, despite it 
being a very bold bet, we were short of supply throughout the quarter and 
did end with a significant backlog as Peter has said. That situation has 
improved some since the end of the quarter, b
ut we still are short in some 
key geographies currently. I would also attribute the performance to the 
delayed purchases from the prior quarter as we discussed in the October call 
as the 
--
 
people were anticipating a new iPhone being announced. I think we 
made the correct decision to go with a broad range of iPhones. It turned out 
to be a benefit as we thought it would. And of course, the 14th week, as 
Peter said, is a part of this, although everyone knew that, as we did as well, 
and factored that into our 
guidance. Geographically, we saw strength in 
literally in every key region. But in particular, I would call out that U.S. and 
Japan, which got billing early in the quarter and had most sale 
--
 
many more 
sales days than most countries. I would also say that
 
was particularly huge 
with the iPhone sales in Greater China, particularly considering that we did 
not launch the iPhone 4S in China until in January. And therefore, had no 
sales into mainland China during last quarter. And so we could not be 
happier. We 
felt we were betting bold, as I think many of you would have 
thought if you would have known what we were doing. But as it turns out, 
we didn't bet high enough. Our customers are loving iPhone and we're very 
happy with that.

My follow
-
up is, as we're doing the math here, it seems like the ASP is up 
sequentially for the iPhone. So it seems like there was a very good mix of 
the 4S and the higher capacity 4S, could you just comment a little bit on 
that 
versus the iPhone 4 which you cut the price of?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
The iPhone 4S was the most popular iPhone during the quarter. And 
consistent with most launches, we typically see a higher mix of the front end 
of the launch.
 
Operator
 
Next, we'll go to Katy H
uberty with Morgan Stanley.
 
Katy Huberty 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Just a follow
-
up on the iPhone discussion. Tim, can you talk about whether 
the pent
-
up demand at the end of December and today 
--
 
is both countries 
like U.S. and Japan that had 
the phone all quarter? Or is it just countries 
that recently received and are able to sell the phone? So if can you talk 
about that, and then the second part would be, does the component 
environment and your production capacity or your suppliers' capacity 
allow 
you to start to address that catch
-
up demand, address China, which is new 
this quarter, and also help you start to rebuild inventory in March? Or are 
there any constraints that you see in the near term?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
I don't want to comment on curr
ent sales trends other than 
--
 
because we 
have included, obviously, that in our guidance. But I would 
--
 
given that we 
just launched in China, I would say the demand there has been staggering. 
We are selling through our reseller stores and our online store
. We're not 
currently selling through a retail store. And the demand is off the charts. 
And so we're very happy with the demand response there. The other 
countries that we launched in earlier this quarter were smaller countries in a 
demand sense. And so we
'll see how the quarter goes from a supply
-
demand 
point of view. We did make progress as we moved from the end of the 
quarter until now, as I alluded to earlier, and got caught up in some 
countries, but there is still some that we are not caught up. So we'
ll see how 
we'll do going forward.
 
In terms of the component environment, generally speaking, the component 
environment is favorable. That was one of the things that allowed us to 
overachieve on gross margin. And we would predict that, that component 
envir
onment stays favorable on most key commodities with the exception of 
hard drives which, as you know, was very much affected by the tragic 
situation in Thailand. And I don't predict Apple having a material supply 
issue during the quarter, but we will pay mo
re for drives during the quarter. 
And that's reflected in our guidance that Peter gave earlier.
 
Operator
 
From Citi, we'll go to Richard Gardner.
 
Richard Gardner 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
I was actually going to ask about the hard drive situation. 
I'd love to just get 
a little bit more detail there in terms of whether it did have any sort of 
meaningful impact on Mac sales during the December quarter? Tim and 
--
 
you mentioned that you expect to pay more for drives. I guess you don't 
expect it to have
 
any sort of impact on revenue for the March quarter?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes, for the December quarter, Rich, there was not a material supply or cost 
impact to any of our product lines as a result of the 
--
 
for the March quarter, 
we're not expecting any mater
ial supply impact. However, in the hard drive 
area, prices have increased and we have included those cost increases in our 
guidance that Peter provided earlier.
 
Richard Gardner 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Okay. And then for the December quarter, you
 
obviously 
--
 
you saw some 
pretty dramatic declines in key components like NAND, down about 10% and 
DRAM down almost 40%. Can you talk about, within that context, how 
favorable you expect pricing to be for some of those key commodities here 
on the March qu
arter and whether the overall industry shortage of HDDs is 
having a material impact on pricing and other categories?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Yes. Last quarter 
--
 
not confirming the percentages that you gave out, but 
we did receive better costs than we had rolled i
n our guidance on 
--
 
particularly on displays and NAND Flash and DRAM. And we would expect 
that NAND, DRAM and most LCDs would continue to be in a position that 
supply exceeds demand for the industry, and therefore those price trends 
should continue to be 
favorable in this quarter and we reflected that in our 
guidance. The big exception is the hard drive, which I pointed out earlier, 
which is constrained on an industry
-
wide basis, and where I believe we can 
navigate the supply issue that we are paying more 
for them and that's rolled 
in our guidance.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Rich, it's Peter. I'd like to just talk a little bit about the gross margin 
guidance to put the component environment in context. We do see that 
helping us sequentially in the March quarter. But
 
overall, we would 
anticipate our gross margin to be down by about 270 basis points. And we 
see that largely coming from the loss of leverage on the sequentially lower 
revenue on the December to March quarter. The nonrecurrence of onetime 
items, which bene
fited us in the December quarter, and the stronger U.S. 
dollar that we've seen.
 
Richard Gardner 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Since you touched on it, Peter, can you talk about how big the nonrecurring 
items were as a gross margin benefit in December?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Yes. They, along with the leverage, the 2 of those together represented 
about 1/4 of the upside that you saw to our guidance. About half of it came 
from better commodity and other product costs, and the remaining quarter 
came from better
 
mix, largely the iPhone sales.

Bill C. Shope

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. Great. I have a question on the iPad. Obviously, a very strong 
shipment number for the December quarter. But with that
 
said, did you see 
any impact at all from some of the new lower
-
priced tablets in the market? 
And I guess looking forward into 2012, how do you think about competition 
from the lower
-
priced content, subsidized tablets like that of Amazon's 
models in 2012?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
We're really happy with the 15.4 million iPads that we were able to sell. And 
as Peter said, we did take down the channel inventory slightly. There's the 
--
 
underlying sell through was slightly higher than that. This is consistent with 
our 
long
-
term beliefs that we've had since 
--
 
before we introduced the 
product, that this is a huge opportunity for Apple over time. And as I've said 
before, I truly believe, and many others in the company believe, that there 
will come a day that the tablet ma
rket and units is larger than the PC 
market. In fact, it's interesting to note that in the U.S., it's clear from the 
IDC's recent data on desktop PCs in the U.S., that tablets exceeded desktop 
PC sales last quarter in the U.S. And so I think you can alread
y see different 
indicators that there is significant momentum in this space. In terms of our 
competitiveness, the ecosystem for iPad is in a class by itself. We strongly 
believed in optimizing applications from day one to take advantage of the 
larger canva
s, and we now have apps totaling over 170,000 available for 
customers. And that compares to what appears to us to be only a few 
hundred for the competition. And so I think people really want to do multiple 
things with their tablets. And therefore, we don't
 
really see these limited 
function tablets and e
-
readers being in the same category. There is clearly 
customers that will buy those. I think they'll sell a fair number of units. But I 
don't think that people that want an iPad will settle for a limited func
tion.
 
And in terms of other tablets, last year was supposed to be the year of the 
tablet. I think most people would agree, it was the year of the iPad for the 
second year in a row. And so we're just going to continue to innovate like 
crazy in this area. An
d we think we can continue to compete with anyone 
that is currently shipping tablets or that might enter in the future.
 
Bill C. Shope 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. Great. And then, I guess digging into the iPhone number a bit 
more, 
you gave us a lot of great color on that performance, but could you dig in a 
bit more to what your learning in terms of iPhone elasticity with the new 
price points for the 3GS, I guess in both the post and prepaid markets? And 
I know in the past, you
've talked about the iPhone and the prepaid market 
that sort of an evolving strategy that you all were approaching with sort of 
an open mind. How are you thinking about that now that you've had a full 
quarter with these lower price points and obviously, so
me success there?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Each of the models, the 3GS, the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S, were 
important in achieving the 37 million total units. And so we're glad to cover 
the broad range with great products. But the iPhone 4S was clearly the most 
po
pular among those. In the postpaid markets, as you know, there's a much 
smaller difference between what the customer pays in each of these. It's 
larger in the prepaid markets, and so it's too early to tell given we just 
started this October as to how this 
will play out over time. But we're thrilled 
with the total result, and you can bet that we're into details in every single 
country in the world trying to learn what we can learn to adjust and even do 
better in the future.

Peter, Tim, I'd like to follow up on your comment that you're actively 
discussing, uses of cash. Is that any different, quite frankly, than what 
you've be
en doing historically? Or is that statement meant to suggest that 
you're thinking more constructively about cash than you have historically?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Tony, it's Peter. We have always discussed, internally as a management 
team and with our board, o
ur cash. We recognize that the cash is growing

A.M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
And then on my follow
-
up, I wa
s wondering, I want to revisit the gross 
margin question. I think in each of the last 10 years, your gross margin has 
actually gone up from Q1 to Q2. I think the last 3 years, which is more 
representative of your mix, it's kind of been going up by 200 basi
s points. So 
by saying it's going to go down 270 basis points, that's kind of bucking 
normal seasonality by 400 to 500 basis points, sounds like the onetime 
items is about 50 basis points. Is the loss of leverage that significant? Or 
what am I missing?
 
Pet
er Oppenheimer
 
The factors that are 
--
 
Tony, that are going to affect our sequential decline 
are primarily 3. They are the loss of leverage from the revenue, so we 
reported $46.3 billion this quarter, which included a 14th week. We see our 
revenues being $
32.5 billion next quarter. So against our fixed cost that will 
have a significant impact. We did have some onetime items in the December 
quarter which won't recur, and the dollar is much stronger. So those are the 
principal 3 reasons. I would also say that
 
44.7 is a high, high, higher than 
we have seen since I've been with Apple in 15 years. And it's hard to 
compare this year versus last because we're in different commodity cycles 
and different currency levels and where we are with our product cycles as 
wel
l. Last year, we did have a sequential increase in iPhones, and that was a 
big contributor to our going up sequentially. We don't see that reoccurring 
this year, especially from the high of $44.7 billion.

So we just got back from CES and everyone has a connected TV, trying to

So just from a high level, how should we be thinking about your strategy in 
the living room?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Gene, it's Tim. The Apple TV product is doing actually very well. In last fiscal 
year that ended in September, w
e sold a bit above 2.8 million units. And just 
in the past quarter, the December quarter, we set a new quarterly record for 
Apple TV at over 1.4 million. But in the scheme of things, if you dollarize this 
in revenue that 
--
 
we still classify this as a hobb
y. However, we continue to 
add things to it and if you're using the latest one, I don't know about you, 
but I couldn't live without it. And so I think it's a fantastic product. And we

Tim, then, try one for you. One thing you didn't mention much in your

And I just wanted to try to get some perspecti
ve: a, what's your perception 
on how it's adding value to Apple's products; and then b, as importantly, 
what are the metrics that you guys are using to determine if it indeed is 
driving success surrounding the various products?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
I think Pete
r shared earlier the number of customers that had signed up for 
iCloud, and it's already over 85 million. So it's incredible that this has 
happened just in 
--
 
just a few months, period of time. We're thrilled with it, 
and the response customers has been in
credible. It's solved a lot of 
problems that customers were having and made their lives incredible, much, 
much easier. And so I see it as a 
--
 
it was a fundamental shift recognizing 
that people had numerous devices and they wanted the bulk of their content
 
in the cloud, and easily accessible from all the devices. And I think we're 
seeing the response from that, and with 85 million customers in just 3 
months, it is a very, very important part. It's just not a product. It's a 
strategy for the next decade.

I wanted to ask about iPhone distribution in the quarter, and outlook for

And in terms of China, what are the prospects for expanding your reach from 
a carrier standpoint in China over the next couple of quarters?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
We are now over 130,00
0 points of sale throughout the world. That's up 
about 35% on a year
-
over
-
year basis. And so we have consistently added 
points of distribution. That's both adding carriers that have captured 
distribution, our own distribution as well as key retailers, whic
h are 
particularly important in some markets. We added carriers last quarter with 
KDDI in Japan and Sprint in the United States. And both of those carriers, 
they can speak for their own results, but we are extremely pleased with both 
companies, and while t
he incumbents that were in the market also did 
incredibly well. And in terms of China, China Unicom continues to be a very 
key partner. I've got nothing to announce today on an expansion there. But 
as I consistently said, China is an extremely important ma
rket for us, and 
we continue to look at how to grow it further.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Okay. And for my follow

up, I wanted to ask about your revenue guidance 
for the March quarter. If you assume kind of weekly sales are adjus
t for the 
14th week, it looks like you're guiding revenue down to about 25% quarter
-
on
-
quarter. However, you started the quarter with a pretty significant 
backlog of iPhones, et cetera, pretty strong momentum. Why would revenue 
be down more than normal sea
sonal or just historical seasonal end of 
March?
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Chris, this is Peter, I'll take that. Let me first start with units and then I'll 
talk about some points on revenue. iPhone, we would expect to have a 
significant year
-
over
-
year increase and
 
be down sequentially, as we reported 
from the 14
-
week December quarter. For iPad, we would expect to have a 
significant year
-
over
-
year increase, and also be down sequentially as 
reported from the 14
-
week December quarter and the end of the gift
-
giving 
sea
son. And for Mac and iPod, we would expect to be down sequentially 
consistent with our typical seasonality. From a revenue perspective, I 
completely understand the question that you're asking, and I want to talk to 
you about 5 reasons why I expect the 
--
 
u
s to be down in greater percent 
sequentially this year than we were last.
 
The first, the December quarter this year included a 14th week, which was 
the week between Christmas and New Year's. That week accounted for 
approximately 1/14 of the December quarte
r's revenue. Second, that week 
between Christmas and New Year's, fell within the March quarter last year 
and it will not be included this year. And sales in that week are typically 
greater than the average for the weekly sales in the March quarter. So when
 
we think about our March quarter on a sequential basis, we would have 
loved to add that week in the quarter that we're now heading into. Last 
year, we increased the iPhone channel inventory by about 1.7 million units in 
the December quarter, so 
--
 
or this
 
March quarter, so that benefited the 
quarter and reduced the comparable. The fourth, our December quarter 
results this fiscal year benefited from the launch of the iPhone 4S. We 
believe there were significant pent
-
up demand for the iPhone 4S heading 
into 
the December quarter, and it's been our fastest iPhone rollout ever. The 
previous iPhone launch took place at the end of June 2010. So in the year
-
ago December quarter marked the second full quarter of new iPhone 
availability. So we have some differences i
n launch timing. And finally, the 
U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent weeks, particularly against the euro, 
and we expect this to have an impact on our sequential compare. Last year, 
the dollar was relatively flat within the comparable time period. All 
that 
being said, we just reported an amazing quarter and we feel very good 
about the momentum of our business.

Tim, I had a question 
--
 
and actually, Peter, I 
realize you're not going to talk 
specifically about cash, but with regard to acquisitions, perhaps you can talk 
a little bit about your strategy behind some other acquisitions including your 
most recent one, which was Anobit.
 
Peter Oppenheimer
 
Shannon, we 
have done acquisitions where it tended be smaller or medium
-
sized companies that have just great engineering and other talent, a great 
start on a product or a technology that we'd like to bring in to Apple, and 
sometimes including the IP. And that's really
 
the acquisitions that we've 
done. We tend to do several a year. We're very, very disciplined in how we 
think about this and how we do it. And I think our track record here has 
been very strong.
 
Shannon S. Cross

And can you talk a litt
le bit about how they're integrated in? I'm just kind of 
curious as to 
--
 
since there's been several sort of semi
-
related acquisitions 
that you've made? I mean, do they sort of become encompassed within 
Apple or do you run them sort of as standalone divisi
ons?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Shannon, we don't believe in lots of divisions like a lot of companies do. So 
we run the company as one instead of a lot of many companies. The 
semiconductor team works for Bob Mansfield, as does all of the hardware 
engineering for the
 
whole company. And so Bob and his team are integrating 
Anobit into that team. Anobit has fantastic technical talent and we're really 
fortunate to have them join us.

Both of my questions kind of link to geographic expansion, maybe for Tim. I 
take the point of your focus in China, but it's also like 
--
 
I think if given what 
you said, you may be at 230 or 235 carriers now. There's about 500 ca
rriers 
in the world, and I was wondering what your ambitions are and what you 
think the reality is over the next 12 to 18 months of I think at least a sizable 
share of them. And I had similar question on geographic expansion, Tim, 
just in terms of country 
rollout, you seem to have at least addressed part of 
China on the retail side, and it sounds like Brazil is next. But when can we 
look forward, Tim, you maybe addressing markets like India or Russia more 
aggressively with your retail presence?
 
Timothy D. C
ook
 
Yes, we are today selling in Brazil through online store and reseller partners, 
including some very key carrier partners. We're selling in Russia through 
carrier partners and reseller partners. And we're selling in India through 
some carrier partners a
nd reseller partners. And so we're in all of those 
countries today. But I've tried to be very clear in the past, and I'll do so 
again, that we have a ton more energy in the China market today. That 
doesn't mean that there is a lack of effort or focus on th
e others. It just 
means that it's less than what we're investing in China today.
 
On the second country on the list of those 4, for us, would be Brazil. I think 
there's a huge opportunity for us there, and we've more than begun to go 
deeper into Brazil. But
 
I don't want to signal that, that means that Apple 
Retail would be there, because I don't envision that occurring in the near 
term. In India where it is small, the revenue went up over 3x last quarter, 
but that's on a small base. And so we're beginning to
 
see traction in most of 
these, but we recognize we have to focus to deeply understand the point 
that we can really get to a large revenue figure like Greater China currently 
is.
 
In terms of more carriers, we have been adding carriers. I anticipate we'll 
c
ontinue to add carriers. We have nothing specific to announce today, but 
you can bet that we're looking at the same list that you are. In terms of 
major carriers there, the number is much smaller than the number you 
quoted, as you know, there is a lot of s
maller carriers on there. And the 
same thing with countries, there's many smaller countries. But all of those 
are important, I'd like to get into all of them over time.

Tim, I want to come back to the tablet market here. Obviously, the iPhone 
was scintillating in terms of the growth, but I think the iPad growth also 
really outpaced a lot of our expectations. And the question really is 
--
 
it's 
kind 
of a loaded question. The question is really around 
--
 
do you think that 
Apple actually benefited from some of these lower cost, reduced features 
that tablets come into the market, where folks came in to check them out 
and realized not really that good, so
 
they trade up to the iPad? And do you 
see that may be happening as well with the MacBook Air this year? Because 
this year seems like to be the ultrabook's version of ""Let's try to be like 
Apple as well.""
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Well, I looked at the data, particu
larly in the U.S. on a weekly basis, after 
Amazon launched the Kindle Fire. And I wouldn't, in my view, there wasn't 
an obvious effect on the numbers plus or minus. The theory that you've got, 
I have heard clearly from some customers that, that occurred, t
hat they 
went in thinking that they would buy that, they'd look at it and decided to 
buy an iPad. Whether that's happening on a very, very large basis, I don't 
know. Again, my own view is looking at our data in the U.S., there was no 
obvious change in the 
data, for what it's worth. That's how I see it. There is 
cannibalization clearly of the Mac by the iPad, but we continue to believe 
there is much more cannibalization of Windows PCs by the iPad and there's 
many more of them to cannibalize. And so we love t
hat trend. We think it's 
great for us. The thing that is very different about the iPad is you can see it 
beginning to appear virtually everywhere. The enterprise has adopted it in a 
very large percent of the Fortune 500, as Peter talked about earlier. That
 
number is also quite large when you look at the Global 500. In education, in 
K
-
12, we sold twice the number of iPads as we did Macs. And generally 
speaking, education adopts new technologies fairly slowly, so that's 
somewhat surprising. And of course, the
 
consumer is 
--
 
has moved in a huge 
way to iPad. And so it's winning market by market, by market. I think that 
consumers that go in and look at it and think about the ecosystem and the 
huge advantages and the overall customer experience, I think we will wi
n a 
fair number of those. And I think you can see that in the results. And so we 
couldn't be happier with doing over 15 million. And I think it's remarkable 
that we sold over 55 million iPads, and we've only been in the business April 
of 2011, I think, whe
n we shipped the first one 
--
 
or 2010, excuse me.

And then the other question I have is given your customer data, are you 
seeing any sort of phenomena now where, because of the accelerated 
refresh 
cycles, the widened gap in terms of what Apple has given to the 
customer base versus the competition's meager efforts, if you will? Are you 
seeing accelerated refresh rates within your customer base in terms of 
someone who buys an iPhone, maybe they're buy
ing it quicker or maybe 
they're also buying now a MacBook Air or an iPad, do you see an accelerated 
refresh rate or a halo effect?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
In the enterprise space, we've seen 
--
 
as an example, we've seen iPhones 
sort of being a catalyst. And the iP
ad moves after the iPhone. And in several 
accounts, we've seen the Mac follow that. And so there are clear examples 
where one product has pulled the other. And at a macro level, how much it's 
happening, it's very difficult to put our fingers on, but many c
ustomers, 
consumers, enterprise, education, they're all pointing that out. And as you 
know, we've seen that phenomenon before with the halo that the iPod 
created for the Mac back at the early 2002, 2003, 2004 range. And so it's 
not a phenomenon that is new
 
to us.

Tim, Android versus iPhone. Is this, in your view, becoming a 2
-
horse race 
similar to Mac versus Windows? And how do 
you see the sustainability of 
your integrated model versus what happened in terms of the growth of the 
OEM model in the PC market?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
I wouldn't classify it like Mac and Windows at all. The Mac has outgrown the 
market for over 20 quarters in a
 
row, but still has a single
-
digit percentage 
of the worldwide market, where iOS, if you look at phones and tablets, and 
the iPod touch, we've sold over 315 million iOS devices. And so I think this 
compares very favorable to any comparison, and over 62 mil
lion of those 
were done in the last quarter alone. I don't have comparable numbers, Mike, 
on Android. I haven't found a way to get very crisp quarterly reporting like 
we do that is straightforward and transparent. However, you can see from a 
momentum point
 
of view, if you look at the MPD data that just came out a 
few days ago, it shows in the U.S., and this is just looking at October, 
November and so this had part of our launch in October and then all of it in 
November, it shows that just the iPhones, looki
ng at phones not total iOS, it 
shows iPhone at 43% and Android at 47%. The Nielsen data that just came 
out a few days ago shows iPhone in the October, November, December 
timeframe at 45% versus Android at 47%. And the comScore data that also 
came out on Oc
tober, November shows iPhone at 42% versus Android at 
41%. And so it seems like all of the data that I've seen in the U.S. would say 
that it's a very close race in iPhone.
 
I think on the iPad side, although I don't have specific numbers to share 
from third
 
parties, I think that all of us inherently believe that iPad is way 
ahead there. And there's really no comparable products to the iPod touch 
out there. And so iOS is doing extremely well. I wouldn't say it's 2
-
horse 
race. There's a horse in Redmond that a
lways suits up and always runs, and 
will keep running. And there's other players that we can never count out. 
And so what we focus on is innovating and making the world's best products. 
And we'll just keep on doing that and somewhat ignore how many horses 
there are. And we just want to stay ahead and be the lead one.

Okay, just as a quick follow
-
up. There's 2 developments in the market on 
--
 
in smartphones that you sort of haven't approached yet, b
ut Android has at 
least approached, which would be 4G and larger screens. In the past, you've 
articulated a fairly firm view both on the iPad and the iPhone of display 
dimensions, for example, you mentioned that earlier in this call in iPad. Has 
the popula
rity, for example, of larger screens on Android phones changed or 
impacted, for example, your view? And same thing on 4G obviously, some of 
these phones have challenges to battery life, but what are your thoughts 
there?
 
Timothy D. Cook
 
Well, I wouldn't com
ment on the future roadmap, I'm sure that's a shock to 
you. But I would point out that we just sold a record 37 million iPhones. And 
so I think there's an incredible number of people 
--
 
and we could have sold 
more if we would have had more supply. But ther
e's a lot of people out there 
that really love what we're doing.

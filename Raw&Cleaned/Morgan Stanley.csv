James Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. In 
the third quarter, the fruits of our 
strategy were evident. Despite a 
challenging quarter for markets, our results demonstrated consistency and 
durability of our business models. Our EPS, excluding DVA and the charge 
for the wealth management acquisition last year, was up sequentially in a 
se
asonally weaker quarter and with higher legal expenses. More important, 
however, we remain focused on our long
-
term objectives.
 
Starting with Institutional Securities, our results underscore the power of our 
integrated models. Our outstanding leadership an
d equity sales and trading 
again benefited us this quarter and we generated our highest revenues in 
the third quarter since 2008. We continue to be first or second globally with 
our continued success driven by the focus on clients, the sustained 
investment
s in technology and targeted investments in certain areas of the 
business. In investment banking, the focus we have placed on improving our 
wallet share in certain areas has paid dividends as growth and our market 
share increase in debt underwriting offset
 
lower market wide advisory and 
equity underwriting volumes. Cross border activity continues to be a 
dominant theme and Morgan Stanley remains the number one ranked firm in 
terms of cross border advisory activity benefiting from the strength of our 
global 
client franchise.
 
The cohesiveness of our model was illustrated by the Verizon deal where we 
are leading one of the biggest M&A transactions in history but also co
-
led the 
$12 billion bank loans syndication and the $49 billion senior note offerings. 
At gro
wing deposit base provided us with an important additional tool in this 
transaction. We also remain focused on ROE in the fixed income and 

doing. We stayed very close to home in rega
rds to risk in third quarter due 
to the liquid markets and this is evidenced both by our average and period 
end VAR.
 
We continue to reduce risk weighted assets in the business and in the third 
quarter at 213 billion. Recalled that this number now excludes 
the IWA is 

income that are core to our future including our people and technology. 
Turning now to wealth management, the third quarter was the first full 
quarter during which we owne
d a 100% of the business and we are just 
beginning to see the benefits. Despite seasonality and a relatively subdued 
trading environment revenues were essentially flat and we improved our 
margins and profitability once again. The revenues and margins were 
supported or driven by some of the benefits of the acquisition. Elimination of 
the order flow agreement and continued growth in net interest income both 
of which generate high incremental revenues and higher incremental 
margins I should say now traditional
 
advice and commission revenues. In 
addition we retained a 100% of the earnings associated with the business. 
Obviously increasing net income to the firm from wealth management in this 
case by over 30% sequentially.
 
As we have discussed with you in the pas
t, this business and the acquisition 
will continue to drive upside for the firm and it's stakeholders as we 
prudently deploy the balance of the deposits from our former partner over 
the next several years in both wealth management and institutional 
securit
ies. We can generate attractive ROEs on the assets supporting the 
deposits in the retail and institutional businesses even in the low rate 
environment and without reaching for risk. This is due to the relatively low 
funding cost, the lack of bricks and mor
tar and our embedded client base.
 
While we do not discuss investment management frequently it's earnings 
contribution continues to grow in absolute terms. We have been very 
pleased with the investment and financial performance of our traditional 
investment
 
management real estate and merchant banking businesses.
 
The continued progress in regards to performance coupled with disciplined 
expense management drove the highest PBT in that business since 2010. We 
remain focused on our expense programs more broadly 
and continued to 
make progress towards our goals although the results are less evident this 
quarter because of elevated legal expenses. We expect to meet or exceed 
our expense targets excluding litigation. In the meantime however we will 
continue to reap t
he benefits of our strategy leveraging our world class 
franchises upside from wealth management and deposit growth, intense 
focus on expense management and thoughtful capital allocation. As you 
would expect we began buying back stock in the quarter. This i
s the first 
time since 2008 and we look forward to increasing capital returns to 
shareholders overtime. I will now turn the call over to Ruth.

DBA. We have provided r
econciliations in the foot notes to the earnings 
release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in the 
quarter was negative 171 million with 141 million in fixed income, sales and 
trading and 30 million in equity sales and trading. Excludi
ng the impact of 
DVA, firm
-
wide revenues were 8.1 billion down approximately 3% versus the 
second quarter.
 
The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the third quarter was 
25.3% inclusive of a discreet benefit. Earnings from continuing operation
s 
applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders, excluding DVA, were 
approximately $983 million. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted 
share, excluding DVA, were $0.50 after preferred dividends. On a GAAP 
basis, including the impact of DVA, fi
rm wide revenues for the quarter were 
$7.9 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan 
Stanley common shareholders were $862 million. Reported earnings from 
continuing operations per diluted share were $0.44 after preferred 
dividends.
 
Book value at the end of the quarter was $32.13 per share, up 
2% versus the second quarter. Tangible book value was $26.96 per share, 
up 3% sequentially.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total assets were $832 billion at 
September 30 up versus last quart
er due primarily to the growth in our 
deposits pursuant to the contractual agreement associated with the 
acquisition of the remainder of the wealth management business. 
Specifically, deposits as of quarter end were $105 billion, up $23 billion 
versus 2Q of
 
which $21 billion was due to on
-
boarding of deposits from our 
former JV partner and the remainder was from organic deposit growth. Our 
liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $198 billion compared with 
$181 billion at the end of the second quarter
. The increase was also driven 
higher by the recently on
-
boarded deposits, most of which have not yet 
been deployed thus resulting in elevated levels of bank liquidity. Our non
-
bank liquidity level also remains elevated.
 
Turning to capital. Although our ca
lculations are not final, we believe that 
our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel 1 will be approximately 12.6% and our 
Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 15.3%. Risk
-
weighted assets under 
Basel 1 and including the final market risk rules are expected 
to be 
approximately $386 billion at September 30. Reflecting our best estimate of 
the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under 
Basel III was 10.8% as of the end of the third quarter.
 
Pro forma risk
-
weighted assets under Basel II
I are estimated to be $414 
billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio to be 
around 4.2%. This estimate reflects the United States proposed regulatory 
rules for the numerator and the denominator and is subject to change if 
rules evolve.
 
Our ratio was consistent with second quarter levels despite no 
longer reflecting the benefit of clearing as a deduction from the denominator 
and the increase in deposits in the quarter, which on a combined basis, 
reduced the ratio by over 30 basis points.
 
We continued to expect to exceed 
the required 5% level in 2015 including an assumption for a greater return 
of capital to shareholders.
 
Turning to expenses. Total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion, down 2% 
versus the second quarter. Compensation exp
ense was down 3%. Non
-
compensation expense was flat to 2Q notwithstanding higher litigation 
expenses, which have been elevated since last year and were higher in the 
third quarter and in each of the first and second quarters.
 
Let me now discuss our busines
ses in detail. In Institutional Securities, 
revenues, excluding DVA, were $3.9 billion, down 8% sequentially. Non
-
interest expense was $3.3 billion, down 2% versus the second quarter. 
Compensation was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, down 8% versus the 
second quarter, reflecting a 42% ratio excluding DVA. Non
-
compensation 
expense of $1.7 billion increased 5% from last quarter, driven by higher 

approximately $25 million, which covers all of
 
2012 and the first three 
quarters of 2013 partially offset by a decrease in activity related costs. The 
business reported a pre
-
tax profit of $542 million, excluding the impact of 
DVA. Including the impact of DVA, pre
-
tax profit was $371 million.
 
In Inves
tment Banking, revenues of $992 million were down 8% versus last 
quarter. Results were driven by continuing strong debt new issuance activity 
and our integrated efforts across Institutional Securities. More generally, 
according to Thomson Reuters, Morgan S
tanley ranked Number 3 in global 
completed M&A, Number 4 in announced M&A, Number 3 in global IPOs and 
global equity at the end of the third quarter. In addition to Verizon which 
James mentioned in his opening remarks notable transactions included in 
advis
ory through our Japanese Joint Venture Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley 
we acted as exclusive financial advisory to Tokyo Electron on it's merger 

underwriting Morgan Stanley acted a
s lead joint global coordinator for the 
2.5 billion follow on equity offerings for Grupo Financiero Banorte, the 
largest Mexican Stock Offering of the year.
 
And in debt underwriting Morgan Stanley served as joint active book runner 
on the General Motors 4.
5 billion debt offering it's first major placement 
since the emerging from bankruptcy protection as well as sole book runner 
on the financing for the previously announced acquisition of Smithfield 
Foods. Advisory revenues of 275 million were down 17% versu
s our second 
quarter results driven by decreased revenues in EMEA. Equity underwriting 
revenues were 236 million down 28% versus the second quarter driven by 
lower results in both the Americas and Asia
-
Pacific.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues were 481 m
illion up 15% versus the 
second quarter driven by investment grade and loan syndication fees. Equity 
sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were 1.7 billion a decrease of 5% 
from last quarter. Results were strong across geographies and products 
evidencin
g less seasonality and it's typical for the third quarter. Derivatives 
revenues increased sequentially as strong risk management offset the 
summer slowdown in certain products. And brokerage balances remained 
relatively constant from the second quarter als
o blocking the typical summer 
trend. Although revenue was down due to seasonality in Europe.
 
Cash revenues declined modestly though held up better than industry 
volumes. Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues excluding 
DVA were 835 million. 
Revenues declined with broader market activity, client 
volumes, market liquidity and thus overall risk levels were generally low 
driven primarily by macro
-
products. DVA was also a drag in the quarter due 
to the tightening of our credit spread and was a sig
nificant driven of 
sequential revenue change. Credit products revenues increased despite the 
challenging environment. Commodities revenues were up modestly driven by 
higher client activity.
 
Investment revenues of 337 million were up significantly versus th
e second 
quarter driven predominantly by the sale of insurance broker hub. Average 
trading bar for the third quarter was 52 million versus 61 million in the 
second quarter driven by low levels of risk taking throughout the quarter in 
fixed income and commo
dities. Turning to Wealth Management, revenues 
were 3.5 billion in the third quarter. Asset management revenue of 1.9 
billion were flat to last quarter reflecting the benefit of higher market levels 
at the beginning of the quarter but offset by lower depos
it referral fees from 
our former JV partner. These fees declined pro
-
rata with the deposits that 
were on
-
boarded in the third quarter.
 
Transaction revenues decreased 4% from last quarter consisting primarily of 
commissions of 507 million which were down a 
11% versus the prior quarter 
due to seasonality and generally subdued activity. Investment banking 
related fees of 185 million which were down 28% versus last quarter 
reflecting lower activity in closed
-
end funds and partially offset by higher 
trading reve
nues of 317 million which were up 42% versus the second 
quarter reflecting higher DCP as well as the benefit of elimination of the 
order flow agreement with our JV partner now that we are on 100% of 
wealth management. Net interest revenue increased 11% to 
493 million 
driven primarily by retiring a preferred security and the JV concurrent with 
our acquisition of the remainder of the wealth management business as well 
as growth in our lending product. Other revenue decreased sequentially to 
75 million from 13
9 million.
 
Last quarter this line reflected revenue from the sale of a business as well as 
[indiscernible] gains that did not repeat this quarter. Non
-
interest expense 
was 2.8 billion flat to last quarter the compensation ratio was 58% flat to 
the second q
uarter. Non
-
compensation expense was $796 million, down 5% 
versus last quarter due to the lack of expense items incurred in the second 
quarter in conjunction with the closing of the wealth management joint 
venture, as well as continued expense disciplines.
 
The PBT margin was 19%. 
Profit before tax was $668 million, another quarter of record profitability.
 
Total client assets were up versus the second quarter at $1.8 trillion. Global 
fee
-
based asset inflows were $15 billion. Fee
-
based assets under 
management
 
increased to $652 billion at quarter end. Global representatives 
were 16,517 higher than the second quarter. Bank deposits were $130 
billion up versus the second quarter. Approximately $94 billion were held in 
Morgan Stanly banks. The third quarter was th
e first in which we did not 
have a drag from NCI from wealth management, because we now own 
100% of the business.
 
Investment management revenues of $828 million were up 23% versus the 
second quarter. In traditional asset management, revenues of $369 millio
n 
were down from the second quarter driven by lower performance fees and 
asset management and administration fees. In real estate investing and 
merchant banking, our revenues were up meaningfully reflecting strong 
investment performance, favorable market c
onditions and catch up of 
carried interest in two funds as we surpassed our hurdle rates.
 
Expenses were $528 million, up 3% from the second quarter driven by 
higher compensation associated with higher revenues. Profit before tax was 
$300 million, up 88% se
quentially. NCI was $64 million versus $21 million 
last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $360 billion driven 
by market appreciations.
 
Turning to our outlook. The impasse in Washington over the last several 
weeks was an unfortunate tax on the economy. Assuming constructive steps 
are now taken, we expect the U.S. growth as well as broader market activity 
to resume the pace that was on prio
r to the events of the last several weeks. 
Although our M&A pipeline has steadily grown over the course of 2013 and 
increase in transaction volume off of the recent lows hinders on CEO 
confidence about the economic outlook. Clearly regarding a long
-
term 
re
solution as distinct from a short
-
term fix is likely needed before there was 
meaningful pickup in new activities. However, M&A revenues for the fourth 
quarter should not be affected to any notable extent by the recent impasse 
in the upcoming decision dates
, because revenues are associated with deals 
that have already been announced and are well on the path to closings. 
Underwriting activity, particularly on the equity side, remained strong. 
Institutional trading activity started off the quarter relatively s
ubdued, but 
may accelerate on the back of the recent temporary resolutions. Retail 
investors have been similarly cautious though they have not pulled away 
from the markets.
 
I will conclude by saying our results evidenced a stable and diverse business 
mix. 
The model weathered a slowing trading environment well but of far 
greater importance is one that is poised for greater upside with normal fees. 
With our high margin predictable wealth management business such a 
significant percent of our portfolio, we have
 
a significant shock absorber in 
weaker markets. In addition, we expect that our earnings will be even more 
predictable with the ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Morgan Stanley 
is well positioned from a resource perspective from a return to somewhat
 
normal market. Our bar is at the lowest levels in the earth and we are 
prepared to take risk on behalf of our clients when demand resumes. 
Liquidity is high and we have a strong and high quality capital base. Thank 
you for joining us. And James and I will
 
now take your questions.

(Operator Instructions) And the first question will come from Glenn Schorr 
with ISI.
 
Glenn Schorr

ISI
 
Hi, thanks. So I heard your comments loud and clear on fixed income in the 
quarter, I jus
t want to make sure that the RWA shrinkage is on track at the 
same pace that you had laid out for us and that there is no necessary 
mindset change in offshore [ph] and still think that you can put up in the, I 

er range in normalcy?
 
 
 
Ruth Porat
 
So our orderly reduction program [ph] is very much on track, has not 
changed that. The only thing that I did discuss at a conference in September 
is to provide greater clarity about our consistent perhaps to reduce 
[indis
cernible] within fixed income. We are breaking out lending from the 

quarter when I said we had 239 billion of RWAs in fixed income if you 
exclude the lending related RWAs that number
 
is 219 billion. This quarter we 
are down to 213 billion and we've similarly reset our end state it was 200 
billion it's now sub 180 billion. So very much on the same path, no change 
there and then as it relates to how we're looking at managing the busines
s 

our cost to capital. We think that the reduction and risk weighted assets is a 
core part of that, expense management is core part of that and that is a key 

at revenues, expenses capital optimization but the key 
lens is really on in ROE and excess of our cost to capital.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Fair enough. On that front just I noticed first is the Basel III ratio that you 
gave at 10.8 is that standardized versus a
dvanced and curious on how we 
got 90 basis point growth in the quarter I mean earnings were okay but risk 
weighted assets were down 2.8% it's a big jump, was just curious how they 
got there.
 
Ruth Porat
 
That's on advanced, it's fully loaded and it is driven
 
by two things, one, 
earnings accretion and then the associated reduction in numerator deducts 
under Basel III and the reduction in risk weighted assets. So both numerator 
benefits and denominator benefits.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Not something we should be loo
king for every quarter, right? I mean it's a 
big, big move.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I'm not going to, I will let you do the forecast they were continuing to drive 
earnings and was continuing to reduce the risk weighted assets.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Okay last one you were 
also on the long
-
term lending commitment page 12, 
there is a wealth management loans and lending lines that's been growing 
sub
-
45% year
-
on
-
year it's up 7% in the quarter. Is that in any way a 
leading indicator for deposit deployment or am I mixing apples a
nd oranges 
there?
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 

the big benefits of the acquisition is onboarding of the deposits. The rate of 
onboarding this quarter this past quarter, the third quarter was un
usually 
high. We had a big slug come over immediately upon shortly after closing 
the acquisition and on a go forward basis we will have 1.75 billion in that 
area, 1.75 billion coming over on a monthly basis. So we had a bigger on 
boarding this quarter but 
the focus really is deployment of those deposits to 
support loan growth both in wealth management and on the institutional 
security side and as we've talked about in wealth management the real 

e got about 
5% penetration, our peers have about 10% and we see very attractive 
growth opportunities both with PLA product that's security based lending as 
well as residential mortgages and so that's what you're seeing and that's 
what we've been building t
owards since 2009 when we created the joint 

 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
I just want to know are those commitments, is that securities based lending 
because my gut is it's a tough environment while refi is dropping by 50% in 
the 
quarter, is that securities based lending? What am I looking at to see 
that kind of growth in commitments? Because something good is happening.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So PLAQUE, the securities based lending PLA you are seeing strong growth 
in it, residential mortgage 
is where you have commitments and that we've 
had a strong pipeline of demand there so even with the slowing environment 

in PLA.

The next question will come from Howard Chen 
with Credit Suisse.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Just a follow
-
up on slower quarter for everyone we can see that you de
-
risk. 
I was just hoping you can discuss where returns are in the major fixed 
businesses today. So we can just track progress over time as the 
environment improves and you do evolve of w
hat you want to do on capital 
and expenses?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the 

 
was that 

 
it was lower volumes industry wide, I would note that 
and I said this in my comments given the tightening in our credit spreads, 
we did also have a meaningful negative swing in CVA 
sequentially. If you 
exclude CVA in both quarters, our FICC results were actually down single
-
digit percentages, but going through the products as you asked, rates was 
challenging, risk remained low. We continue to run with the historically low 
levels ther
e. It tapers down in May as you may recall I talked about that last 
quarter. So we would look to see some upside in that business longer term if 
markets normalize. Foreign exchange was down quarter
-
over
-
quarter. That 
was volumes and mix. Electronic is bett

higher margin. So that was bit of a drag. On credit 

 
on the credit side as I 
noted, it was a bright spot. We were actually up quarter
-
over
-
quarter. We 
had good performance across IT distressed and high yields and was 

Morgan Stanley. Mortgages was also quieter and commodities was up a bit 
modestly, but still running at lower levels. So overall, I mean, the net of it 
you can see in the results was slow
er, quieter, quarter. Our risk was down, 
we are always down in those areas and we would expect to see some upside 
as markets normalize.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay, thanks Ruth. And switching over to supplemental leverage ratio, can 
you discuss what t
he change in centralized clearing assumptions did to the 
model and is it simply earnings generation during the quarter that made up 
to that delta for that model change and with the positive inflows you 

 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of clearing in the second quarter, I think the general industry 
lead was clearing would benefit the denominator. And obviously in the 
second quarter, the rules have just come out prior to various earnings calls 
and we have now had ti
me to assess clarify certain items. There were 
changes in both the numerator and the denominator. And in particular with 


 

d we are still very 
focused on back loading. And we have seen an acceleration in interest in 

one of the few tools to reduce exposures. The other thing that changed 
quarter
-
over
-
quarte
r is the on
-
boarding of deposits that I mentioned, we on
-
boarded $21 billion of deposits. So just those two were 

 
was about a 30 
basis point reduction and the offset to that really was in the numerator 
between earnings and some of the numerator deducts wa
s the offset.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay, thanks. And then you have been speaking to higher litigation 
expenses over the past few quarters, James, you have talked about it more 
broadly to the investment community, I was just hoping you could take a 
s
tep back and just give us a sense of what inning you believe Morgan 
Stanley is in working through just crisis related litigation issues?
 
James Gorman
 

disclosed all of the litigat
ion risks that we have out there and we are working 

elevated expenses for a couple of quarters, I am sure there will be 

 
some of 
that will continue, but we are managing our way th
rough. We have I guess 
the good fortune to be one of the smaller dogs in this price, and as an 
institution and we obviously have less of the traditional mortgage exposure. 
So in some areas, we are just not participants happily, but in the traditional 

 
in 
some of the litigation we are.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay thanks. And maybe just a last follow
-
up to that one, Ruth, how would 
you sort of size the incremental litigation expenses this quarter and could 
you also just give us the size on the gain on s
ale of Hub as well? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So litigation has been running about $200 million to $300 million higher per 


 
same set of 
issues associated with pre
-
crisis matters and so it should come down when 

$300 million. And then with respect to the sale 

 

the overall in
vestments line. There are number of items in that. And I think 
on a go
-

more reflective of future run rates.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay, thanks.
 
Operator
 
Next question will come f
rom Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
I just wanted to clarify a little bit the comments that Ruth made about the 
receipt but not really deployment of the deposits. I mean there must have 
been some impact on net 
interest income for GWM and maybe more broadly 
for the corporation from the receipt of those deposits or is that not fair?
 
Ruth Porat
 

-
boarding 
of deposits we did have a big portion come o
ver in this quarter, a lot still in 

quarter some of the upside in net interest income and wealth management 
is due to growth in our lending balances. The other benefit you see in N
II is 
associated with the acquisition part of the acquisition we eliminated 
outstanding preferred with Citi and the expenses associated with it. So two 
drivers of net interest income but you're absolutely right, there is upside this 
quarter in that and we 

deploying out of cash into AFS and loan growth.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
And then you gave a you told us that your quotes are one of 10.8 under 
Basel III was under the advanced basis. Can you tell 
us what the calculation 
is on standardized basis?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So on a standardized basis RWAs are a bit higher it's obviously the second 


ove that minimum.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
So you're saying the RWAs are higher and so the standardized ratio would 
be lower?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yeah. The standardized ratio will be lower; I guess that's most relevant 
actually under CCAR moving to 
standardized for 2015 but of course 
requirements under CCAR for standardized is 4.5%.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Right. Goldman gave some comments on their investment banking backlog 
and said that it was actually the best it's been in five years.
 
Can you give us 
a sense for your comments sounded a little bit more cautious in that regard 
but can you give us a sense for the direction of your backlog relative to last 
quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The backlog is up, it's actually it's high been in years. My com
ment with 
respect to in particular M&A is the backlog in M&A has been growing nicely 
throughout the year consistently but the main factor really is while we have 
talked about on many other quarters which is M&A is proxy of CEO 
confidence and given the impa
cts in the last couple of weeks and the fact 

just had a caveat that until there is confidence about the economic outlook I 
wouldn't want to suggest that that growing pipeline ac
tually goes through to 
announce and closed.
 
It's frustrating because all signs had been that DC was improving and 
confidence was up and the pipeline was building accordingly and hopefully 
we get a resolution and we actually see that work its way through. T
he 
equity pipeline is also very strong, the highest it's been in years and I think 
that we would expect to see more activity that moving through the pipeline. 
The fourth quarter tends to be seasonally better than the third quarter given 
July blackouts and 
August and it's a very strong high
-
quality pipeline.
 
Guy Moszkowski

And then the final question is on FICC, you have someone else had asked 
identified in the past a minimum target revenue of 6 billion and I think the 
implication has b
een that in order to exceed your cost of capital you need to 
generate that kind of revenue levels year
-
to
-
date on a cleaned up ex
-
DVA 
basis. You have done about 3.5, so let's say that you're cracking for 4.5ish 

ion, do you remain as confident as 
you might have been a couple of quarters ago that the $6 billion is a 
realistically achievable level and if not have you, are you making any 
incremental changes to your resource deployments?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We remain very focu
sed and confident about the path to a higher ROE in 
fixed income and as I said there are three major levels, revenues which is a 
function of the operating environment among other things. And so we will 
put that to the side expenses and capital. And we are 
looking at all three 
levers, but the main thing is controlling that which we control to drive ROEs 
greater than the cost of capital within fixed income. And so between expense 
management, some of the things that we have been doing there continue to 
do and 
capital optimization we have a flight path to an ROE in excess of cost 


 
Guy Moszkowski

Autonomous Research
 
Got it. So 
it sounds like you feel that you might be able to achieve that cost 
of 

 
that, that return ahead of the cost of equity without necessarily 
achieving $6 billion in revenue given the expense and other capital levers 
that you can use. Is that fair?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.

Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
 
Mike Mayo

CLSA
 
Hi. I just wanted to follow
-
up on your comment James tha
t you are just 
beginning to see the benefits from acquisition of the 100% of the joint 
venture. I mean your branches are already down your profit margin is up 
some to have the deposits aside from additional loan penetration to your 
customers, what other be
nefits are still to be achieved?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So I will start on that. There are quite a number if you just go through the 
items that we talked about that are the contractual benefit as a result of the 
acquisition that will probably give you a sense of why w
e believe we are just 
beginning to see it. So one is the order flow agreement that we terminated 
that upon completion of the acquisition and so order flow previously went 

line. H
owever, given industry volumes were lower in the third quarter just 
with the overall markets having seasonality, we had a more modest benefit 
lower than we would expect on a quarterly basis and then a more normal 
environment still upside there.
 
Net interes
t income I already commented on, but with continued loan 

given the margin on that 

 
on loan products we see real upside in NIM. 
There are couple of other ins and outs to deposit ref
errals in the FDIC fees 
smaller and then obviously the elimination of NCI, which is below the line, 
but does benefit earnings. And so again a more normalized environment 
continuing to build out the loan book the upside from that lending product 
are droppin
g to the bottom lines.
 
James Gorman
 
And I think, Mike, I would add a couple of additional thoughts. One is if you 

concentrated. And during the period of turmoil of the 
crisis, post
-
crisis and 
then our acquisition of Smith Barney and various staggered pieces that we 
hurdle on the way, there was a lot of attrition, a lot of moving people 

inconv
enient for clients in many cases, but that level of turnover has 
dropped significantly and we expect it to continue to drop. So that reduces 
your overall compensation costs, because obviously recruiting deals can be 
very expensive, number one. Number two, 
the strength of the old Smith 
Barney business at its core was its managed money program and the 
strength of the Morgan Stanley business at its core was its capital markets 
capability, which is based upon Westchester. And we are continuing to see 
each of th


growth in the managed money side and you are seeing very good retail 
distribution of institutional underwriting. So I
 

more robust business and the broader industry structure is more 
accommodating to better performance over time.
 
Mike Mayo

CLSA
 
As far as the outlook for the number of reps, the number of offices, how 
much you are looking t
o organically grow the business from here and also 
how long will it take to deploy the new $20 billion of deposits again?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of FA headcount, it was up this quarter for a couple of reasons. 
One, attrition has been running at low levels 
for some time. It was even 
lower this quarter and then we had a higher number of trainees with the 
probably the training program and the time of the year. You could see that 

are sti
ll focused very much on as a productivity and we just had a larger 

in and around that level. In terms of branches you saw the number of 
branches come down this quarter, the way we
 
look at that it it's a function of 
really market by market analysis, [indiscernible] the question is do you have 
completely fully staffed offices within any market, strong culture, no more 
room in this space. No need to consolidate or should you consolida
te so at 
this point the big reductions that we've seen are really behind us now it's 
just market by market analysis and then in terms of the deployment of the 
deposits to support loan growth, you're really going to see that the deposits 
deployment go not j
ust into wealth management products but also 
institutional products and of course the AFS portfolio and as we consistently 

management. So there is nice growth near
-
term and we've been build
ing 
that infrastructure as I've said since we created the joint venture back in 

using the term prudent study pace and you will continue to see it deployed 
over the next continued st
udy phase.
 
Mike Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
Then last follow
-
up what specific loan products by category would it be a lot 
of mortgages or what else in addition to that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well the main thing is really this PLA product, the securities based lending 
product 
which is a more flexible product for our clients really enables them 
to retain their securities portfolio, continued to be invested in the market 

mortgage is next on the list, the next ma
jor category for our retail area and 

and again given the low levels of penetration. And then on the institutional 
security side its product very consistent with our strong areas withi
n our 
franchise to James opening comment where we have strong client franchise, 
strong bankers that built the incremental infrastructure required. So for 
example in commercial real estate, in project finance areas consistent with 

dy in where we are already serving clients, we're 
now just expanding the suite of products. So it's growth in both areas.

Just a follow up on the SLR, you mentioned some changes in that process. 
You guys have gone through the proposal, in terms of getting from 4% to 
5% in 2015. Can you just give us an update on that glide path again in the 
past you said collapsing is in tra
de but anything that has changed based on 
further review of the proposal?
 
Ruth Porat
 

path there because there are opportunities with both the numerator and 
denominator and very consi


rules and starting with the denominator where we see the biggest 
opportunity, the first is with our focus on reducing risk
-
weighted
 
assets and 
fixed income that leads to a reduction in the balance sheet, a reduction in 
the grossed up balance sheet of this relationship between RWAs and grossed 
up balance sheet. So that's number one, its very much on strategy. The 
second is derivatives 
growth as I said can be reduced through compression 
trade; we've been focused on that for some time. We had not previous as of 

opportunity. All that we've done in central clearin
g, our focus in particular on 
back loading helps facilitate the pace of compression trades and just in the 
SLR was announced and the BIS proposal was announced, we have seen an 
interesting in compression we think both in U.S. and in Europe and the total 
co
mpression opportunity is greater than what we had assumed from 
clearing. So that is very much in the plan. There is also numerator benefits 
from capital accretion and some of the numerator mitigation so that the 
combined gets us to a strong glide path to g
reater than 5% in 2015 and also 
important to know it includes the assumption that we would have spiteful 
capital returns to shareholders.
 
Mike Carrier

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
And then just on the asset management business it seems like each quarter
 
it comes in stronger than expected. I guess just two questions on that on 
the traditional side it seems like it was a little weaker you mentioned 
performance fees to just trying to figure out how much that impacted it? And 
then when I think about the real
 
estate and merchant banking, just longer 
term you just want to try to gauge how much of that business you guys can 
still do meaning its funds managed by others versus anything that you might 
have to shrink over time. Just want to get an update on that?
 
Ru
th Porat
 


 
it was down due to higher performance fees in the second quarter. And then 
we had higher waivers on liquidity funds this quarter. And then on real 
estate and merchant ba
nking as I said the upside was gains there. We 
recently broke through hurdle rates on two funds. So we had catch up on 
carry for those two funds. We are now close to the end of the catch up for 
those two funds. We are earning carry on several other funds, 
but good 
performance and had attractive catch up on carry. And then in terms of 
looking forward and those funds we have strong teams in place. We are 

capital you have in those business
es.

can understand how much is recurring and how much was sort of more one

Ruth Porat
 
No

 
Brennan Hawken

UBS
 

management just to sort of verify because I think there was a little bit of 
confusion before to be open on this, woul
d you guys had a bump in your 
investments line in the investment management division, but that really 

 

that right?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, within investment management, we had carry catch 
up as we indicated, 
because we broke through the hurdle rate on a couple of funds. And so a 
majority of that actually is retained at Morgan Stanley and NCI can see as 
well, there is still NCI associated with the funds, but now we retain a large 
portion of 
that in
-
house.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay. So that was the primary source of the carry and then we have got to 
just basically come up with our own assumptions about how much is catch 
up and how much is repeatable?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Correct.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Ok
ay. And then you gave some great color on the strength in the equities 
business of remarkably strong quarter really especially looking at the U.S. 
counterparts, they have reported here to
-

there were any kind of one
-
time comp

but just kind of just want to verify, is there anything that we should think 
about as one
-
time in nature in that number?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, we have consistent 

 
I feel like quarter
-
after
-
quarter we talk about the 
strength
 
in our Institutional Equities business. There was another strong 
quarter across products and geographies and I have said that a number of 
quarters in a row here balanced across the franchise. DV balances were very 
resilient and that was notable given summ
er seasonality. And cash equities, 
the market data indicates that we outperformed with industry volumes 
down, so a strong quarter. Typically, the fourth quarter is lower in part with 
PB balances lower as managers go into year
-
end, but nothing to note other
 
than consistent strong performance by the Institutional Equities business.
 
James Gorman
 
One of the things that has been a determined move by the equities 
management is to provide a much more integrated approach across cash 
derivatives prime brokerage to o
ur clients. And I think that help me as gain 
market share and obviously helps with the stability of the revenues.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Terrific. Thanks. And then last one for me just on the buybacks, is this the 
right pace we should assume or should we ass
ume some pick up here in 4Q 
and the buyback is approved through the first quarter too, so we should 
carry that through that right, just want to verify my understanding there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. The approval process for CCAR through the end of the first quarte
r of 
2014. So you should assume that we will use it no later than the end of the 
first quarter of 2014.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
And is it okay; is it right for us to assume that there is a space for a pickup 
in the phase?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well the map would 
just that given what we've used so far.

The next question will come from with Fiona Swaffield with RBC.
 
Fiona Swaffield

I just have a couple of follow
-
up questions on [indiscernible] and deductions. 
Firstly on the deductions they seem to hav
e fallen quite significantly on 1.5 

whether its into institute GTA [PH] or private equity funds I'm not sure and 
then the secondary is on the Basel III RWAs, they have gone do
wn outside 
of fixed income I think for the first time, I remember it. Are you doing 
something particularly outside fixed income as well on the Basel III 
efficiency basis? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of Basel III RWAs the main focus really is in the fixe
d income as 
you know as you said I think it just consistent with overall wider market low 
volumes the backdrop that we have been talking about. In terms of the Tier 
1 common and numerator and deductions there obviously the buckets and 
waterfall of numerato
r deductions based on Tier 1 common levels and so 
again as we create capital there are reduced deductions, numerator 
deductions kind of the waterfall.

The next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.
 
Eric Wasserstrom

Sun
Trust Robinson
 
Just two clarifying questions, one back to the SLR glide path, does the 
continued on
-
boarding of deposits is that done sort of ratably over the 
period of time in terms of their contemplation in SLR or is the endpoint 
somehow fully loaded in 
the current figure?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So there are two parts to that question, the on
-
boarding of deposits was 
very large in the third quarter due the, that was contractual nature of the 
acquisition, one large tranche came on as I said a couple of weeks after 
clo
sing and then the balance of fit is about 1.75 billion per month through 


month through mid
-
2015 and yes
 
that is fully loaded into the estimate of 
greater than 5% in 2015.
 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
SunTrust Robinson
 
Got it, it's just that the influence of the incremental is just not so significant 
over the
-
 
Ruth Porat
 
Exactly and as you have deployment you have gre
ater earnings though 

 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
SunTrust Robinson
 
Got it and then just returning to FICC, it sounds like the most significant 
comment you made is that adjusting for some of the items that your results 
quarter
-
on
-
quarter would have been down actually relatively little and so I'm 
just trying to reconcile that with the and of course it looked like there was a 

just trying to reconc
ile that with the continued reduction in RWAs to 
understand how it is that there is this group of assets that seem to have so 
little profitability associated with it.
 
Ruth Porat
 
That's precisely the problem they have so little profitability, associated wit
h 
them currently and on a go forward basis. So the RWAs that we identified 

are drag on the overall returns in the business and through passive and 
active mitigation we are please
d to be shutting them at the fastest pace that 
we can. You've seen that we are materially ahead of anything that we laid 
out you know we were 390 billion on the old [ph] basis, RWA is back in the 
third quarter of '11 it's been a lot of heavy lifting and we
 
are getting near to 
the 
--
 
there is light at the end of the tunnel given the pace of execution and 
with business leaders having the analytics, dashboards to know how to 

exiting th
em and it does help on the overall returns because it not only helps 
free
-
up capital from fixed income but I think that it's providing us with more 
consistent quality earnings base within fixed income which is one of the key 

t how to resize any kind of capital return on 
a go forward basis.

Hi, good morning. Just on the 

 
back on the share repurchases, you think 
you c
ommented I think earlier, greater share repurchases to hit the greater 
than 5% target. And obviously also as part of the ROE expansion, does that 

 

approved for, is that right?
 
Ruth Po

I mean the answer what I think your question was and then let you have a 
follow
-
up if I missed it.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
Okay.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So I was answering one question regarding the very small share repurchase 
program we approved to do 
this year that ends through March, we enter the 
end of the first quarter. And as we look forward given all that we have done 
to build capital given the greater consistency of results, the accretion of 
capital, we are building in our view increased flexibil
ity to return more 
capital on a go
-
forward basis. We are not going to judge CCAR or timing 
cadence, but it does build greater flexibility on a go
-

what I was trying to convey. I am not sure if I hit your questions.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
B
arclays Capital
 
Yes, mostly. I guess the point being that greater share repurchases is part of 

would expect to do higher than the small repurchase next year as that gives 
you a y
ear?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We have certainly built in that in providing this guidance of higher than 5%, 
but until we see the CCAR number, we have the capacity to do it.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
Got it.
 
Ruth Porat
 
As what the greater than 5% means and my cave

CCAR rolls, the shocks. So we are not going to prejudge CCAR as that I am 
not going to say what it will be next year, but we certainly have the capacity 
with the glide path to greater than 5% with much higher share repurchase 
even i
ncluded in that number.
 
Roger Freeman

Barclays Capital
 
Okay. And then I just wanted to maybe get any updated thoughts you have 

yet, but there has been a lot of obviously 
discussion in the industry and 
others have gotten out, this is where 
--
 
how do you think this stands for you 
strategically?

years. We want to be 
smart about what we do to drive returns in the business for the firm overall 
and so really no update at this point.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
Okay. And just a small one on the 

 
back on the carry, I know you are not 
quantifying 
the size, but what percentage of the way 

 
the carry catch up, is 
this typical 80
-
20 in catch up?
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
Roger Freeman

Right, 75% and 80% away there?

The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
 
Jim Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
Hey, good morning. One quick follow
-
up on the SLRs, are compression 
trades and OTC clearing, are the
y in your guidance? I thought it was 
excluding that, it was just sort of the run
-
off would get you to 5% or did I 
misunderstand that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in the second quarter as I said, the general industry read was that 
clearing would benefit the denominator. 
Since then its clarified clearing unto 
itself does not, so take that out. When you take that out and you add the 

However, what we have separately 

 
we have the time now to do is g
o 
through and quantify the benefit from compression trades. So compression 

pace of activity with compression trades volume that we are targeting with 
compression trades is what he
lps is one component of what drives the 
leverage ratio higher. The fact that we have been focused on central clearing 
for some time and that we have been focused on back loading facilitates the 
pace of compression but put those two as distinct issues and i

clearing itself, but just compressions.
 
Jim Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
Fair enough, the compression in your guidance of that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. Compression is in the guidance.
 
Jim Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
Okay, thanks. And then on the c
ost saves, can you give us some sense in 
where you are, you targeting $1.6 billion net by the end of next year? Where 
do you stand at this point?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we are very much on track for the expense reduction goals. When we set 
out the goal, as you may 
recall, of $1.6 billion reduction, it's at the end of 
2012 and said by the end of 2014 we would be down by 1.6 billion but we're 
also very careful to say that that was predicated on revenues flat to 2012 
and indicated that it was higher revenues which we e
xpected certain 
expenses would go up in particular those that are activity
-
based but that we 

hold for it number of different components and when you look at the 
components of non
-
compo
sition expense year
-
to
-
date, activity related costs 
like brokerage and clearing and transaction taxes are up while non
-
activity 
related costs like occupancy and market data are down and so when you 
kind of go through the map take 2012 revenues, deducts tha
t our expense 
ratio back then was I think it was 84%. If you deduct the 1.6 billion expense 
savings, we said we would get that takes your expense ratio down to 79%. 
We now have revenues up from activity related costs up but net
-

that level and 
if you exclude elevated litigation expense we're ahead and our 
view is that litigation expense will be a cost for the industry for the near
-

that at some point. So very much on
-
track
 
for the expense program ex
-
litigation.
 
Jim Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
Right I mean I understand what you're saying you had targeted ratios but 
revenues are up where do you think they should be current revenues or I 
guess another way to say if you thin
k your 50% of the way through it 25% 
or 75%. I mean obviously you must have some kind of thoughts on absolute 
headcount or something like that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Just on the numbers given we are already at the 79% expense ratio that 
was implied back in 2012. One 


way through executing it and so we have the balance of next year fourth 
quarter balance of next year to continue to execute on programs tha
t we've 

we're continuing to execute on the programs that we identified back at the 

reduce expense rate.
 
J
ames Gorman
 
I will just add that there is a culture of expense management across the firm 
but we haven't seen for long time whenever I travel around the world local 
offices, sub
-
business groups everybody understands the program; 
everybody understands what 

-
coordinated 
program with 40 or 50 executives as part of it. So this is going to be 

already at the 79% but that's honestly that's not our focus, our focus
 
is 
continue to make the firm more efficient by bringing in together as one firm 
which we did taking three platforms to one in wealth management, 
operating wealth management closer to institutional securities, lot of the 
electronic development within insti
tutional securities. So there have been a 
lot of things that are going to be ongoing for next several years and I think 
we will continue to add.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we completed three of eight quarters and achieved the target in the end 

g to work.

The final question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
 
Matt O'Connor 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
You guys provided a lot of details on fixed RWAs but if you talked about the 
total assets in that business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We have not 
broken that up, no.
 
Matt O'Connor 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
I guess if I can take a stab at trying to get to the opportunity of reducing 
those assets if we think about RWAs coming down by 30 billion to 40 billion 
obviously there is a multiplier effect for the overal
l firm. I will thing it's more 
for FICC. It seems like it might be in the 100 billion to 150 billion range in 
terms of total assets within FICC that might come down?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I'm going to go through the map on the call if there is some technical you 
want
 
to follow up with IR, you can do that.
 
Matt O'Connor 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay but it should be a multiple of RWAs I would think, right?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we're looking at the RWA reduction, we're looking at grossed up balance 

usinesses through a risk based capital 
lends, leverage based capital lends, increase doing an SLR lend. So again 

is coming down as we 
--
 
and grossed up balance sheet is coming do
wn even 
more as we reduce risk weighted assets.
 
Matt O'Connor 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay and then just separately as we think about the remaining 35 billion or 
so deposits coming in some of the benefits that you still get from what just 
came on, how should we th
ink about the blended yields you deploy that into. 
Obviously, this could be a mix of retail loans, corporate loans and some

eturn on cash, AFS,

James Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. 
We will again 

priorities we delineated in January that will drive our return on equity and 
return on tangible equity, excluding DVA to greater than 10% and 12% 
respectively.
 

 
during the quarter and we met or 
exceeded several of the goals. Let me just go through them quickly. First 
was to acquire 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture. As you know 
we closed on the final 35% of that joint venture on the last business day of
 

not going to spell them out again. Suffice it to say however the deal was a 
game changer for this firm and for our shareholders, now and for decades to 
come.
 
Secondly, we put out a g
oal to achieve Wealth Management margins through 
expense management and through revenue growth. In addition to owning 
100% of the business, one of the key drivers for our way upside is the 
revenue and margin upside in the Wealth Management business. Both w
ere 
higher this quarter. The margin of 18.5% represented the fifth consecutive 
quarter of margin improvement, excluding non
-
recurring costs associated 
with the integration in Q3 2012.
 
We reached our highest margin level since the first quarter of 2008. In 
addition, we increased our margin goals for the Wealth Management 
business at our financials conference in June to 20% to 22% by the end of 
2015 without the benefit of high rates of markets and more than 23% if 
markets or rates increase. Why the increase? 
The margins reflect the simple 
math of the upside from 100% with ongoing investment in the business, 
using the first quarter of 2013 results as a base.
 
Our third objective was to significantly reduce RWAs in fixed income and 
commodities. We continued to ma
ke progress regarding our fixed income 
RWA reductions, ending the quarter at $239 billion, down from the first 
quarter. We continue to expect fixed income RWAs to be below $200 billion 
by the end of 2016.
 
Our fourth goal was to drive expenses lower in 2013
, 2014 and beyond. 

through this in more detail. As you can clearly see, our expense ratios have 
improved as we said they would with revenue growth.
 
Our fifth point was to grow earn

opportunities. We recently received approximately $16 billion of deposits in 

The team is executing against our plan to prudently deploy those depo
sits in 
support of loan growth in both institutional securities and wealth 
management. Now that we own 100%, we can execute on more of the 
initiatives we have in place to better align institutional and wealth 
management, including a deeper partnership betw
een the businesses and 
their trading days. Because order flows no longer split with our former 
partner, we expect deeper and more efficient markets to both our 
institutional and retail clients, as well as greater revenue opportunity for 
fixed income, in ad
dition to the order flow benefit we discussed [with you] 

products and increasing the efficiency of firm funding.
 
So our sixth point asked, what did it all add up to? Well, despite difficult
 
markets, our results this quarter evidenced strength and resilience. 
Revenues in all of our major businesses were up double digits year over 
year, with Institutional Securities excluding DVA, up 40% and Investment 

ased to commence the share 
repurchase we announced this morning, which will offset some of the 
dilution relating to employee stock programs and also benefit ROE. We 
recently received a non
-
objection from the Federal Reserve to return 1% of 
our tier
-
1 capit
al and will execute on the buyback in the forthcoming 
quarters.
 

term returns with businesses that balance each other in volatile markets. 
With the acquisition of 100% of Wealth Manag
ement, that business model is 
solidly in place. Our Wealth Management business complements our leading 
institutional securities business and the adjacencies across the entire 
platform will drive upside for all of Morgan Stanley. We have strength across 
are
as of fixed income and are consistently in the top three in equity 
underwriting and M&A lead tables with increasing momentum in fixed 
income underwriting. Our investment banking franchise is a leader globally 
and we demonstrated the power of our footprint 
with important cross
-
border 
deal announcements in the quarter.
 
I would now like to draw particular attention to our institutional equities 
franchise which consistently ranks top two globally in market and wallet 
share. In the second quarter we continued to
 
execute extremely well against 
challenging markets. In the cash product we benefitted from the hybrid 
voice and electronic model centered around integrated client coverage. We 
approached this business with the delivery of research driven content, 
market i
nsight, and state of the art trading technology to a wide variety of 
client types. Our electronic offering spends cash, synthetic cash and 
derivatives, and has more than doubled market share over the last three 
years.
 
In equity derivates, our team is capit
alizing on the investments we have 
made over the last several years driven by the breadth of our client reach, 
deepening relationships and partnerships across the firm, and ongoing 
strong risk management. And last but not least, in prime brokerage with 
sig
nificant balances we have a practice focused on market access, service 
excellence and innovative solutions for clients, all leading to an outstanding 
performance by institutional equities this quarter.
 
With Morgan Stanley's global reach, we are confident t
here is continued 
upside for this business and for the firm.
 
Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Ruth and look forward to your 
questions later on.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the 
effective DVA
. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures. The impact of DVA 
in the quarter was $175 million with $114 million in equity sales and trading 
and $61 million in fixed
-
income sales and trad
ing. Excluding the impact of 
DVA, firm wide revenues were $8.3 billion, down approximately 2% versus 
the first quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the 
second quarter was 31%.
 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morg
an Stanley common 
shareholder, excluding DVA, were approximately $720 million which included 
a negative adjustment of $152 million related to the acquisition of the 
remaining 35% stake in the wealth management joint venture. Earnings 
from continuing operat
ions per diluted share excluding DVA was $0.37 after 
preferred dividends. EPS included a negative adjustment of $0.08 per share 
from the acquisition of the remainder of the wealth management joint 
venture.
 
On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm
 
wide revenues for the 
quarter were $8.5 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to 
Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $831 million. Reported earnings 
from continuing operations per diluted share also inclusive of the negative 
adjustme
nt of $0.08, were $0.43 per share after preferred dividends. Book 
value at the end of the quarter was $31.48 per share, tangible book value 
was $26.27 per share reflecting a reduction of $1.49 due to the completion 
of the acquisition of the wealth manageme
nt joint venture partially offset by 
earnings.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total assets were $806 billion at June 30, 
essentially flat versus last quarter. Deposits were $82 billion, basically 
unchanged from the prior quarter. Quarter end deposits di
d not reflect the 
first tranche of deposits that are transferred to Morgan Stanley in 
conjunction with the acquisition of the remainder of the joint venture. The 
initial deposits come in on a lag basis with $16 billion transferred this week. 
We will receiv
e the remaining deposits on a monthly basis through the 
middle of 2015.
 
Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $181 billion compared 
with $186 billion at the end of the first quarter. The decline was driven by a 
reduction in bank liquidity as 
we deployed excess liquidity to support loan 
growth. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 
common ratio under Basel 1 will be approximately 11.8%, and our Tier 1 
capital ratio will be approximately 14.1%. Risk
-
weighted assets 
under Basel 
1 and including the final marker risk rules are expected to be approximately 
$404 billion at June 30.
 
Reflecting our best assessment and expectations of the recently received 
Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel 
III 
was 9.9% as of the end of the second quarter. We know that this ratio 
reflects our best interpretation at this time and it's subject to change as we 
further study the new rules. We estimate our pro
-
forma supplementary 
leverage ratio to be 4.2%. This es
timate reflects the most recent United 
States proposed regulatory rules for the numerator and the denominator and 
is also subject to change as we study the guidelines. We have a clearly 
identified path to exceed in 2015 to 5% regulatory requirements.
 
Turni
ng to expenses, total expenses this quarter were $6.7 billion, up 2% 
versus the first quarter, with compensation expense down 3% and non
-
compensation expense up 11%. Relative to the expense reduction targets 
that we articulated in January, we remain on tra
ck as best evidenced by our 
expense ratios relative to our 2014 target. Recall that we expected that 
some of our expense reduction effort to result in $1.6 billion decline from 
2012 reported expenses to 2014 full year expenses. Our $1.6 billion target 
was 
set based on revenue consistent with 2012 levels, notwithstanding our 
expectations for growth. Thus we further indicated that on higher revenues 
our variable expenses would grow, but the overall expense ratio would 
improve.
 
Our revenues excluding DVA were 
up 8% in the first half while expenses 
were up 5%. Excluding higher litigation costs, our expenses would have 
been up 2%. Our $1.6 billion cost reduction target on flat revenues implied 
an expense ratio of approximately 79% for the firm for 2014. We are at
 
that 
level in the first half of 2013 and would be even better than 79% without 
higher litigation, with still more expense savings to be realized over time. As 
a reminder our target for two year target and expenses have and will likely 
continue to vary fro
m quarter
-
to
-
quarter. Recall that we had some non
-
recurring expenses in the second half of last year.
 
In addition, we had severance and certain wealth management items in our 
result in the first half of this year. Our targets include an expectation for 
con
tinued elevated legal expenses, but of course those tend to be lofty and 
difficult to forecast. We continue to work through our cost cutting programs 
and they will drive operating leverage through the end of 2014.
 
Let me now discuss our businesses in detai
l. In Institutional Securities, 
revenue excluding DDA were $4.2 billion down 5% sequentially. Non
-
interest 
expense was $3.4 billion, up 3% versus the first quarter. Compensation was 
$1.8 billion for the second quarter, down 7% versus the first quarter, 
ref
lecting a 42% ratio excluding DDA. Non
-
compensation expense of $1.6 
billion increased 16% from last quarter, driven by increased litigation 
expense as well as revenue and activity related costs. The business reported 
a pretax profit of 4785 million, exclud
ing the impact of DVA. Including the 
impact of DVA, the business reported a pretax profit of $960 million.
 
In investment banking, revenues of $1.1 billion were up 14% versus last 
quarter, with strong growth in EMEA. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan 
Sta
nley ranked number two in global completed M&A, number three in 
announced M&A, number two in global IPOs and number three in global 
equity at the end of the second quarter.
 
Notable transactions included, in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as lead 

takeover offer from Vodafone. In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley 
successfully priced the $4 billion IPO of Suntory Beverage & Food Limited. 
Morgan Stanley acted as joint global coordi
nator and [lead left] book runner 
on the international tranche. Our JV partner MUFG also acted as joint book 
runner on the domestic tranche. And in debt underwriting Morgan Stanley 
acted as an active book runner on Petrobras Jumbo $11 billion fixed tranche
 

offering.
 
Advisory revenues of $333 million were up 33% versus our first quarter 
results, driven by cross border activity and improved performance in EMEA 
and the Americas. Eq
uity underwriting revenues were $327 million, up 16% 
versus the first quarter, driven by a significant increase in IPO activity and 
the highest level of sponsor related activity in several years. We had 
strength in the Americas and Asia, particularly Japan
. Fixed income 
underwriting revenues were $418 million, up 2% versus a strong first 
quarter driven by loan syndication fees.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.8 billion, an 
increase of 13% from last quarter. Equity revenues were up br
oadly across 
products, regions and client segments versus the first quarter. Client 
revenues were the highest level in over a year driven by higher market 
volumes, increased volatility and greater prime brokerage balances. In cash 
equities, the revenue inc
rease was driven by continued strong market share 
and volume growth, in particular in the Americas. Derivatives revenues were 
up versus last quarter with strength across regions particularly in Japan and 
the Americas and in part driven by higher volatility
. Prime brokerage 
revenues also increased driven by increased activity during the European 
dividend season and higher client balances which increased with overall 
market levels.
 
Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA 
were $1.
2 billion. Fixed income revenues decreased versus the first quarter 
due to higher volatility that resulted in lower client activity. However, a 
reduction in our risk levels during this period helped offset price volatility. FX 
delivered its fourth consecut
ive quarter of revenue gains benefiting from 
ongoing strong contribution from the firm's electronic trading platform. 
Commodities results were up meaningfully versus the first quarter benefiting 
in particular from increased client activity in North America
n power and 
natural gas as well as precious metals volatility.
 
Generally, however, the oil liquids market which overtime has been the most 
important driver of our commodities business, continues to operate at 
historically low levels. Finally, there was a m
odest CVA benefit in the 
quarter. Other sales and trading negative revenues of $57 million compared 
with positive revenues of $73 million last quarter. Average trading VAR for 
the second quarter was $61 million versus $72 million in the first quarter 
drive
n by a reduction in risk in May in fixed income and commodities.
 
Turning to wealth management. We achieved revenues of $3.5 billion in the 
second quarter, a record level. Asset management revenues of $1.9 billion 
were consistent with the first quarter, ben
efiting from higher market levels 
that were offset by lower deposit referral fees due to a rate reset late in the 
first quarter. Transaction revenues decreased 7% from last quarter 
consisting primarily of commissions of $567 million which were flat to the 
prior quarter.
 
Investment banking related fees of $258 million, down 6% versus last 
quarter, reflecting lower new issue volumes. And trading revenues of $223 
million which were down 25% versus the first quarter, reflecting the impact 
of lower activity due 
to difficult market conditions in June. Net interest 
revenue increased 8% to $446 million driven primarily by growth in our 
lending product. Other revenue increased to $139 million in the quarter, 
primarily due to a gain on the sale of our global stock pla
n business and our 
investment portfolio gains.
 
Non
-
interest expense was $2.9 billion, flat to last quarter. The compensation 
ratio was 58% versus 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a higher level of 
net interest income and higher non
-
compensable revenues
 
in the other 
revenue line. Non
-
compensation expense was $834 million up 3% versus 
last quarter due to a number of expense items incurred in conjunction with 
the closing of the wealth management joint venture, including software write 
offs, branch consolid
ation and increased advertising expenses. The PBT 
margin was 18.5%. Profit before tax and the PBT margin benefited modestly 
from the net impact of the unusual revenue expenses in the quarter. Profit 
before tax was $655 million, the highest level of absolut
e profitability since 
the inception of the joint venture.
 
We reported non
-
controlling interest of $100 million in the quarter, reflecting 
a full quarter of earnings. Prospectively we will not have the NCI deduction.
 
Total client assets were basically flat 
to 1Q at $1.8 trillion. Global fee based 
asset inflows were $10 billion. Fee based assets under management 
increased to $629 billion at quarter end. Global representatives were 16,321 
up slightly from the first quarter. Bank deposits were 127 billion effec
tively 
flat to 1Q. Approximately $70 billion were held in Morgan Stanly Bank. As 
mentioned previously, we received the first wave of deposits associated with 
the final 35% ownership this week.
 
Investment management revenues of $673 million were up 4% versu
s the 
first quarter. In traditional asset management, revenues of $419 million 
were up from the first quarter, driven by higher performance fees and asset 
management and administration fees. In real estate investing revenues 
decreased 11% versus the first 
quarter when the firm realized strong, 
principal investment gains. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, 
the majority of these revenues are passed to third
-
party Investors in the 
non
-
controlling interest line. In merchant banking, revenues were up
 
31% 
compared to the first quarter driven by higher principal investment gains.
 
Expenses were $513 million, up 12% from the first quarter, reflecting a 
change in revenue mix. Profit before tax was $160 million, down 14% 
sequentially. NCI was 421 million ve
rsus $51 million last quarter. Total 
assets under management increased to $347 billion driven net inflows of 
$9.8 billion.
 
In terms of our outlook, in the U.S, positive economic data suggests that 
headwinds are abating. Improving employment, signs of stren
gth and 
discretionary consumer spending, a healthy outlook for housing and a 
declining deficit are encouraging signs for our clients and our businesses. 
Recent Federal Reserve guidance is also constructive, in particular its 
emphasis on interest rate polic
y. Institutional clients are repositioning in 
response to the Fed comments. Equity activity in the U.S. remains strong 
with U.S. Equity viewed as a relative safe heaven. Our M&A pipeline remains 
healthy with corporate clients increasingly focused on execut
ing strategic 
priorities ahead of potential rising rates. And our retail clients remain 
engaged in the markets.
 
In the Eurozone our outlook for GDP remains subdued. We expect to see 
higher activity levels, but only relative to anemic lows in recent periods
. 
Japanese markets remained strong and we are well positioned to give 
partnership with MUFG. In short we benefit from our leading positions 
globally, our franchise momentum continues and we are increasingly 
leveraging strengths within business unit to the 
benefit of the entire firm.
 
Thank you for joining us and James and I will now take your questions.

hitting the margins, you do the buy in. The one area that it just seems like 
for that business it still looks little bit on the lower side would just be on the 
retur
ns and grant this quarter. There is a lot of charges and you don't get 
the full benefit. But it just seems like even on an adjusted basis, it might be 
in that 7% to 8%. Just going forward, what's the driver there of improving 
those returns? Obviously as th
e margins pick up, that's going to benefit it. 
But just what's the long
-
term opportunity for the return in the Wealth 
Management business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well a couple of points, given there was an acquisition, there is goodwill 
associated with it. So the retu
rn on tangible equity in the business is about 
30% today. And we do see the profitability, the profit margin and the 
returns on that business increasing. So up nicely year
-
over
-
year increased 
versus the last quarter and really reflects the ongoing strength
 
on the 

line. I did call out that there were some higher expenses this quarter, but 
fundamentally the benefit on the expense line. And we do see longer term 
upside as we continue to exe
cute on the lending products. So again upside 
from lending. We revised our target to 20%
-
22% by the end of 2015. And 
again to be clear, that was with no assumption about higher equity market 
levels or rate changes and we expect that we would be above 23% w
ith the 
benefits of market and rates.
 
The other thing I would note is that this quarter we did take the charge 
associated with buying in the balance of the wealth management business. 
That's $152 million charge, so the return on equity excluding that 10%, 
but 
again I would focus you to the return on tangible equity given the 
acquisition.

So you gave the color on the leverage, you kno
w ratio and the outlook in 
terms of 2015. In terms of 
--
 
how do you get there? What are the different 
leverage points that you have? And then any impact on the revenues of the 
business. And the probably more importantly, given that you have got the 
buyback
s this quarter and for the rest of the year, how do you think that 
plays in? Because obviously their earnings power is improving, the leverage 
ratio is lower, but you are getting some buyback opportunity. So when you 
think about buybacks going into '14 and
 
'15, any view on that just given the 
different dynamics. Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. So let me start with the leverage ratios. I indicated we estimate we 
are spot at about 4.2% this quarter and as I said we expect to be above 
15% in 2015. We do see opportuni
ties with both the numerator and the 
denominator, and most important they are very consistent with the strategy 
against which we have been executing. So starting with the denominator 
where we see a big opportunity, there are a couple of things to note. Fir
st, 
with our focus on reducing risk
-
weighted assets in fixed income, this is not 
model approval but passive and active mitigation and as a result we are 
taking balance sheet down because there is a relationship between risk
-
weighted assets and gross balanc

repeatedly said, we are taking risk
-
weighted assets down in areas that are 

 
The second is our focus on central clearing. We have talked 
about that on 
many calls. We have invested meaningfully in central clearing. We are well 
positioned to increase the volume of our derivatives through central clearing 
and back
-
loading old trades leads to an elimination of the gross up in the 
denominator. W
e are obviously accreting capital which benefits the 
numerator. So when you incorporate those items, 500 million share 
repurchase we talked about and then assumption that we do continue to 
return capital on the future, that takes us to this glide path to a
bove 5% in 
2015.
 
Now to be clear, on top of those items we do believe there are additional 
opportunities to reduce the denominator but it's too early to quantify. A 
couple of examples. With banks on both sides of the Atlantic focused on 
reducing 
balance sheet, we believe there could be lower derivatives 
notionals by compressing offsetting trades between clients and 
counterparties for non
-
clearable derivatives. A second opportunity is more 
upside in central clearing. In our calculation, we only inc
orporated our 
expectation for the amount to be cleared in the next 12 months. We didn't 
go beyond one year. This is an important area and so we do see, again, 
upside in the reduction in the denominator from the amount that's centrally 
cleared.
 
And then fin
ally, consistent with all that we have been doing to optimize 
capital, business unit leaders have the analytics to optimize the returns, we 
have talked about this in the past. We charge them for the capital balance 
sheet and liquidity needed to support the
ir business. And when you look at 
the way we are organized with our bank resource management effort, we've 
talked about that in the past, BRM. It's a centralized resource governance 
structure. We are well positioned to make appropriate resource allocation 
adjustments. So we do feel good about the strength of our capital base. We 
have baked in returning more capital into that calculation and I would note 
that we are already above 6% at the bank.

Very encouraging to see the buyback. Can we assume that, that was 
something that was approved as part of your approvals process with Fed just 
ahead of the joint venture buy
-
in?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, just to
 
break it down, in the 2013 CCAR, the only request we put in, as 
we've talked about on prior calls, was for the wealth management 
acquisitions given how strategically important that is. And there is a 
provision though within CCAR, once you have capital app
roval you can apply 
for an additional 1% of tier 1 capital for capital action. So upon closing it, I 

as we went to the final closing of the wealth Management acquisition, we put
 
in the request to use this incremental 1% of tier
-
1 capital for capital actions. 
We thought it was the logical next step and are pleased to have the 
approval, no objection and to be commencing the share repurchase. It 
hasn't yet started. We just got appro
val for it, so it gives the ability to use it 
as James said in his opening comments.
 
James Gorman
 
I think, Guy, that the key first I'd say consistently is to focus on the strategic 
platform, get Morgan Stanley in the shape that it needs to be in for the ne
xt 
decade and more. And then the financial management through buybacks 
and other capital actions obviously follow from that. So were very careful to 
make sure we got the deal done even though it was a modest capital outlay 
of $400 and some million before s
tarted anything on the capital action. And 

 
Guy Moszkowski

Autonomous Research
 
But just to follow up on it then, as we think about the platform and the 
capital that's needed in it, I look a
t the capital allocations that you give for 
the different business unit, which is as I told before a very, very helpful 
disclosure which a lot of people don't do. So thanks for that. I noticed that 
you brought the capital in ISG down this quarter by a litt
le over $1 billion. 
And with the accumulation of retained earnings you brought the parent 
unallocated capital up by a little over 2 billion. Are we supposed to read or 
can we read anything into that and to what you think you need for the 
different business
 
platforms and how much you might be accumulating for 
ultimate return?
 
Ruth Porat
 

absolutely right, the parent capital number went up. The allocation is based 
on the final Basel I
, Basel 1 plus 2.5 if you want to call it that. And with the 
reduction in risk weighted assets and fixed income that we require less 
capital in fixed income, which is why the ISG number went down and the 
parent number went up, accretion of earnings plus th
e reduction of capital 
required in the business. Now the way we are managing the business is with 

III as soon we are 
--
 
the industry is reporting on the Basel III basis 
complete
ly. But fundamentally, what you see here is that we are continuing 
to accrete capital. That's why we said we believe we are increasing our 
degrees of flexibility that's reflected in our Basel III tier
-
1 common ratio and 
in particular the clarity we think w
e have with the execution path on the 
leverage ratio. So directionally, yes, and then the numbers have changed a 
little as we move to Basel III.

The next question will come from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.

Congratul
ations on the buyback and results. On the core client fixed 
franchises, it's been a challenging backdrop, but I think you've expressed 
some level of disappointment on absolute basis, and the results somewhat 
like it appears. As you looked at broader fixed 
franchise performance, what 
do you attribute under performance to? And what's within your control from 
here to improve those results and the trajectory of it?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, it was a tough quarter. We reduced risk in May given our concerns 
about the pote
ntial market volatility within fixed income products. You can 
see that. When you look at VAR, we ended the quarter with VAR down about 
15%. And as I noted risk weighted assets were down, down to $239 billion. 
In our view it does set us up well going forwar
d to support higher client 
activity. And we do 
--
 
I think that we have upside in quite a number of the 

across our franchise given the benefit of adjacencies.

We don't frankly compare for size. We have a different structure business

those paths as we laid out at the last analyst call getting to their individual

e sum aggregate obviously gives us a decent return for the 

 
Howard Chen

Credit Suisse
 
Understood, thanks. And then switching gears over to GWM. Ruth, asset 
administration fees grew but may be 
not as much as we expected with the 
lag pricing dynamic. So, I was just hoping you could walk through the 
dynamics of the moving parts of the referral fees this quarter? And any other 
notable trends ex the referral fees that you might have seen through the
 
business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, you went right to the key point which was the referral fees. That 
referral fee is set on an annual basis and it's based on rates at the time. It 
was reset late in the first quarter. So this is the first full quarter of the lower
 
deposit referral fees. It gets reset again next year. And the deposit referral 
fee, just like the higher FDIC fee as well, both of those roll off as the 
deposits roll over to Morgan Stanley.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
And then my final question, thanks f
or all the thoughts on the supplemental 
leverage ratio, just, if I heard you correctly, it sounds, Ruth, like most of the 
mitigating actions you could take are mostly on fixed income. And I guess 
when I take a step back, I inherently think of yourselves in
 
trading 
franchise, equity is being inherently more levered business than fix. So how 
do we kind of marry that with you having fantastic equities results with that 
inherently being a higher leverage business with you achieving the glide 
path, if that makes
 
sense? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So a couple of things. One, we are managing a leverage
-
based capital 
--
 
looking at both leverage
-
based capital and risk
-
based capital and a portfolio 
actually, when you manage those two, results in the highest overall 
return. 
Second, on the gross up. In terms of the gross up for the balance sheet, the 
areas that we're running down are areas entirely consistent, as I said, with 
the strategy we're executing upon. So back to James' comment that we are 
not focused on fixed 
income size for size's sake, we are looking at the 
returns on the business. And so the run down in risk
-
weighted assets 
enables us to focus on the areas that are core to our client franchise where 
we are continuing to put risk behind clients and the reduct
ion in 
denominator associated with the move to central clearing. Again, we have 
repeatedly said on calls that we believe that central clearing is not only good 
for the market because it increases transparency and standardization, but it 
does play to Morgan
 
Stanley's strength because it's less about competing on 
size of the balance sheet and more about content and service and execution. 
So we were moving in that direction in any event and the opportunity to 
back load old trades in the central clearing and th
ereby reduce the 
denominator, again, consistent with our ability to have a right, a focused, 
fixed income business that plays to our strength and again benefits from all 
that we are doing across the franchise.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay. Maybe just o
ne follow
-
up on that. I guess what I am asking is, it 
doesn't sound like there is a high level of concern that this supplemental 
leverage ratio and mitigating to that will disrupt these great results, share 
gains that you have all made in the equities busi
ness over the last few 
years?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I know as I said, I think what the elegance of the rundown to 2014, if that's 
the right word to use, is it is consistent with the strategy that we have 
already articulated and against which we're executing. And our 
equities 
franchise is a stellar franchise, continued strength across products and 
geographies, balanced across the franchise and so again able to continue to 
execute.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
I just
 
wanted to clarify, Ruth, when you said getting the leverage ratio of 5% 
that has an assumption for return of capital in the future. What did you 
mean by that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We included an assumption but I don't want to prejudge where 2014 CCAR 
comes out, and
 
given flexibility that we have as I enumerated the various 
other items to further reduce denominator. We have built in levels of 
flexibility so that again it will be based on where CCAR is at the end of this 
year and managing the mix of levers that we hav
e. But I noted it because 
500 million is a good first step in terms of a share repurchase and it is a tool 
that we believe we've built flexibility to use on a go forward basis, but don't 
want to prejudge 2014 CCAR by putting a number out there.
 
James Gorma
n
 
I would just point out though, since the last CCAR we have had earnings of 
800, round numbers, 800 of [BM2] and 900. So we are obviously accreting 
reasonably healthy levels of capital quarter
-
by
-
quarter.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
Still on the topic of capital,
 
the ROE is about half of where your target is. 

is in this quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yeah. So James laid out in January the six point ROE plan and as he said 
we've already made progress, s
ubstantial progress on a number of the 
items. Completing the Wealth Management acquisition obviously a key step. 
The earnings this quarter don't have to benefit of that incremental 35% we 
closed on the last day of the quarter. That starts July 1. The reven
ue and 
margin upside, we've delivered, but as we indicated we think there is more 

very much on track, if not ahead of track and we do believe that there is 
upside in that business. 
We're continuing to execute on the wealth 
management 
--
 
sorry, on the expense ratios.
 
And expenses were a bit higher this quarter as we noted. Litigation was a bit 
higher and again we're on a good trajectory to have tighter expense ratios 
as we go through 

which again gives us some upside and capital as well. So the ROE this 
quarter was obviously also depressed by the charge associated with buying 
in the Wealth Management business. But when you roll those 
items 
together, excluding the charge about 6% and then we see upside from the 
six items that we've consistently taken you back to.
 
James Gorman
 
Mike, I'd just say there is nothing that we have seen in this quarter that 
changes our view on what we laid out 
on our ROE projections. We stand by 
them.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
And you mentioned backlogs a little bit, but could you elaborate a little bit 
more?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. The pipeline does remain healthy. U.S. Activities is strong as I did 
note. Europe is up, but 
that's versus a very week prior 12 months. Japan 
continues to be strong. Emerging markets are mixed. China is slow. Brazil 
has a big pipeline, but as challenged. We think that's on pause at least for 

c. So it's very 
country specific. I think the intriguing element is this backlog in M&A which 

that to CEO confidence. But what we are increasingly hearing is 
reassessments of ti
ming, in particular as Fed comments are that any moves 
are data dependent. Where there are signs of improvements in the 
economy, that isn't inspiring, in conjunction with concern about higher rates 
and what that means is if there is a delay. So we are hope
ful to see that 
backlog start moving through the execution. The drivers today on activity 
have been more cross
-
border as I noted in the sponsor and activist related 

Mexico and Japa
n.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
And two more smaller ones. Litigation, how much was it this quarter and 
where do you expect that to go and what's normal?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the second quarter was up a 140 relative to the first quarter. It's proven 
to be an 
ongoing cost for the industry associated with all the pre
-
crisis 
matters. It's proven to be lumpy, tough to forecast. But we called it out in 
terms of the expense comparison, because at some point the financial crisis 
is behind the industry and these start
 
to abate. And just to give a sense, first 
half this year versus first half last year we were up $250 million.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
And then lastly your VAR was down, at some others, it was up. What is that? 
Is that just a more cautious risk profile or is t
his just temporary?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The VAR was down in particular on the interest rate and credit line. And that 
really goes to my comments that we reduced risk in May given concerns 
about potential market volatility within fixed income products. And I think 
t
he team did a good job managing that, but it does set us up well to put to 
support client activity this quarter going forward. We have capacity there.

The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
So a quick one on
 
leverage. Does the new rule change your view on moving 
derivatives over to the bank sub?
 
Ruth Porat
 

now. And the way we are looking at it, it's obviously just come out and it's 
st
ill in the proposal stage. But if we move derivative to the bank, we get a 

unsecured any more, but with deposits. So there is some optimization there. 
And I think the way we are thinki
ng about it is client preference, efficiency, 
logic of it, how the market is evolving, we have some capacity in the bank 
that we have a clear flight path for the holding company. So it's much more 
about looking at the specific asset classes and assessing i
t and it's too early 
to actually answer it more specifically than that.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
That's fair. So, switching gears then, I guess as you guys continue to work 
to improve margins in wealth management, is there a way we should think 
about FA headco
unt going forward?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, FA headcount is up a bit this quarter. We continue to be very focused 
on FA productivity which as I noted is at a record high. And kind of in and 
around this level is logical and again our focus is primarily on FA 
produc
tivity. So it's not a line in the sand here.
 
James Gorman
 
It will bounce around a little bit quarter
-
to
-
quarter. Honestly, I wouldn't 
think about it too much.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
But really productivity is probably the bigger driver in the way that we 
sho
uld think about it more so than actually the number it has?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.
 
James Gorman
 
By far.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Great. And then last one from me. As NII becomes sort of more important to 
you all and the asset leverage increases paying a lot more 
attention to that, 
and so this question is a little dated, but I kind of not pay as much attention 
to [NII] guys for a while. It seems as though NII and ISG has been really 
weak since 2008. What's been behind that? Is there any way to think about 
that or w
hat are the drivers there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, I think your opening comments actually answered it. NIM is much more 
a banking book than a trading book concept and so it's much more relevant 
for the wealth management business and it has been improving nicely and
 
should continue to as we deploy deposits. So really it's less relevant in the 
trading business.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay. And on the [latter] business, the wealth management business, we 
have seen kind of a move here in the two and three year 
treasury. Is there 
any benefit that we can expect down the line for you guys from that move or 
is the deposit investment for shorter and only really like the six months 
LIBOR would have an impact?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yeah, we've indicated that it really is 
--
 
we fo
cus on the much shorter end. 
So the first 150 basis points in Fed funds is about $1.1 billion in PBT for the 
business. To the extent we're seeing rising rates because there is improving 
economic activity, that's constructive for all of the businesses but t
he 
guidance that we provided was really anchored at the short
-
end.

Could I just ask a follow up question on the derivatives business as you

have you done any work trying to figure out what the, if any, capital benefit

derivatives to centralized clearing platf
orm?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Still too early.
 
James Mitchell

But is it at least 
--
 
it makes sense that you get some benefit or there is just 
no way to tell at all.
 
Ruth Porat

trying 
to quantify it for our call, it's too early, or to estimate (inaudible) capital, too 
early.

Okay. And just a follow

up on the spread question on the deposits. As you 
pull in $55 billion over the next 24 months. 
How do we think about, you

end, but in the near
-
term I 
assume you are putting it mostly in the AFS portfolio.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Correct.
 
James Mitchell

Buckingham Research
 
And with the backup in yields in the inte

get some benefit. I know your target was 1% spread before the rate spike, 
should we be assuming a little bit better than that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We are still fairly short and it's been our philosophy given we have been in 
the low 
interest rate environment is to keep duration short, given the 
inevitable rise in rates would prove to be a financial drag, and I think that 
was the right thing to do.

you can, but just thinking about the 1%, is that a mechanical outcome of 
this provision to be able to apply for that and not to read into that one way

requests with say your leverage ratio where it is against the target? Are they 
separate issues?

businesses. How's that going from yo
ur perspective? And it seems like what 

found the same thing?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. The big event was obviously category two. The move went well. Clients 
are ready. We didn't have operation
al issues. We do think the staggered 
rollout of clients was constructive between category one and category two. 
At this point it's premature to judge I think the impact fully on market 
activity because there were so many other exogenous events. But it went
 
well and we feel we are well positioned.

Fiona Swaffield

RBC Capital Markets
 
Two things. Firstly on the Basel III look through the 9.9 versus Q1. I don't 
know if you could talk about th
e numerator and the denominator, because 
the RWAs keep on going down in fixed income, but there seems to be 
something offsetting it was the first question. And the second question was 
the total exposure number. So the supplementary leverage ratio exposure 
and the move to that through to full. If we look back and you have that big 
reduction in FICC Basel III RWAs, could you tell us where the exposure 
would have been or the leverage ratio would have been at the bottom, just 
to work out what the correlation is
 
potentially?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Okay. So, on the first question, the Basel III firm wide RWAs are $426 
billion. Some of the movement between the first quarter and the second 
quarter obviously there is earnings accretion. There was obviously the 
charge associated 
with the Wealth Management acquisition and then just 
finalization of the rules. That gets you to the 9.9%. And then could you 
repeat the question regarding the leverage ratio?
 
Fiona Swaffield 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets
 
I'm just trying to understand the moving p
arts on the total exposure, 
because we've obviously seen the fixed income RWAs come down a lot in the 

how much is the total exposure going down is really due to the fixed 
income? Is
 
it 
--
 
those total exposure numbers would have been much higher 
before you started reducing the fixed income book.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It would have been much higher before we started reducing the fixed income 
book. And I think the two buckets that I broke out, one
, the RWA reduction 

$239 billion and most of that really is in areas that are relevant to the 
growth subs, in particular our structure credit, credit correlation business. So 
yes, 

be on an execution perhaps to take it down even more, which is what gives 

moved, already moved quite a bit. We were ea
rly in central clearing. And so 

central clearing and look forward to continuing to execute on that portion.

The final question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
 
Matt
hew Burnell

Wells Fargo Securities
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the disclosure, 
particularly specific to Wealth Management loans on page 12. I guess I'm 
just curious as to if there is any dollar target or growth target of tho
se loans 
now that you've got deposits obviously flowing in from the MSSB 
transaction, given your ongoing statements about trying to grow the spread 
revenue within wealth management?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, I may give you a somewhat unsatisfactory answer because I'm
 
not going 
to be able to quantify it by buckets, and the reason is, we've said 
consistently that we are leading with credit risk management and that it will 
be a prudent build
-
out of the portfolio and that is how we are continuing to 
build it. So, the depo
sits are going to continue to grow and support growth 
and lending product both for wealth management and institutional securities. 
And on the wealth management side, the biggest growth is on the securities 
based lending and secondarily on residential mortg
ages. We have 5% 
penetration of our clients relative to our peers who have 10%. So, our view 
is that there is tremendous upside. We've got a tailwind there but we're, 
again, leading with prudent steady growth and that's going to be the 
continued philosophy
 
around it.
 
And then on the institutional side, that's also how we are going to be 
utilizing some of the deposits. We do get a funding benefit when we move 
dollar for dollar funding benefit when we substitute unsecured debt with the 
more efficient deposits
. So, certain product does move to the bank and 
obviously our relationship or maybe not obviously, our relationship in that 
lending is in the bank. And then we have an attractive opportunity growing 
bank appropriate product in the bank. So areas where we a
lready have very 
strong teams, domain expertise, client base, like commercial real estate 
lending, asset
-
based funding, project finance, we can grow the lending suite, 
an area we hadn't here too far been focused on. So, it is a real diversified 
portfolio o
f assets supporting growth on both wealth management and the 
institutional securities businesses that we'll build over time. And we'll be 
sharing more about the bank and the bank strategy over time given the 
growth that we are seeing there.

Then just switching gears a little bit, James, maybe a question for you in 
terms of how you are thinking about the long
-
term total payout ratio of the 
firm given that you've now taken a big step towards that with the 
announ
cement of the 500 million share buyback?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, as I say, journey of the 1,000 miles begins with a single step and 
we've had our first step, that's really what mattered. We don't want to get 
ahead of that obviously. It's what payout ratios are.
 
It's going to be a 
function of where absolute earnings are and managing against the changing 
regulatory environment. But what we wanted to do is put ourselves in a 
position where we could launch a buyback and begin that process which is 
what we did.

James P. Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. We will review the progress 

comprehensive steps we laid out in January 
that will drive our return on equity and return on tangible equity, excluding 
DVA to greater than 10% and 12% respectively, assuming a flat revenue 

owards 
each goal during this quarter and we remained committed to the targets as 
laid out.
 
First and the first point number one to acquire 100% of the Wealth 
Management joint venture. As hopefully you know during the first quarter 
we received a non
-
objecti
on in the CCAR process to our request to use $400 
million of our excess capital to buying the remaining 35% of the joint 

consistent with the process for the 14% purchase last year and we lo
ok 
forward to hearing from the Fed over the next several weeks or months.
 
Number two, to achieve Wealth Management goals through expense 
management and to exceed them through revenue growth. Due to better 
expense controls and a more robust revenue environm
ent we were able to 
drive another 17% margin resulting Wealth Management in the first quarter, 
despite seasonally higher expenses.
 
In addition, our flows in the managed accounts were very strong at over $15 
billion. Long
-
term we continue to believe this is
 
an extremely attractive 
business for Morgan Stanley. There is continued upside to profitability driven 
by a constructive environment in expense controls that gradually shifts back 
into equities by our clients, continue migration of managed accounts from 
c
ommission based accounts, and finally revenue and margin upside from 
earning a 100% of Wealth Management.
 
Point three, to significantly reduce risk weighted assets in fixed income and 
commodities. We made good progress with the fixed income risk
-
weighted 
a
sset reductions and in the quarter at $253 billion, down from $280 billion at 
the end of 2012 and slightly below our year
-
end target of $255 billion. Our 
progress was partially driven by passive mitigation with much of the decline 
driven by credit derivati
ve contract expiries. Although we are pleased with 
that progress, we remain comfortable with our year
-
end target of $255 
billion.
 
Point four was to drive expenses lower in 2013, 2014 and beyond. Non
-
compensation expenses continue to come down sequentially 
consistent with 
the progress we have made last year and the targets we outlined in January. 
In addition, our firm
-
wide NIC compensation ratios excluding DVA in 
severance well below our full
-
year 2012 ratios, while our total compensation 
dollars were also b
elow those from year
-
ago. This largely reflects the 
significant headcount reduction we made over the past 12 months across 
that business.
 

opportunities. As we discussed when we repor
ted the fourth quarter, we 
believe there is significant revenue upside and expense savings for both 
institutional securities and Wealth Management as we move closely along 
those businesses. Institutional securities and Wealth Management launch the 
joint ve
nture in September 2012 to increase collaboration between the 
businesses and there are currently of 40 initiatives in various stages of 
execution. We are already seeing the benefits in the first quarter and expect 
additional upside over the next several ye
ars.
 
For example, prior to 2013 the firm had two separate groups focused on 
fixed income middle markets institutional clients. In January these groups 
were integrated under a uniform platform on leadership and are evidencing 
positive early results. Revenue
 
generated on these accounts was up despite 
aggregate market volume declines for the particular products in the same 
period.
 
During the quarter, we continue to deploy our excess bank deposits more 
efficiently. Our mortgage lending was again higher and we m
ade significant 
progress in regards to our PLE or Portfolio Lending Efforts, where we expect 
to drive the majority of our retail lending growth over the next several 
years.
 
On the Institutional side, we added two new initiatives to our bank suite 
platform 
in the first quarter, and we are in the early stages of execution for 
commercial real estate and warehouse lending. There remain significant 
opportunities from growing our bank. As we have previously discussed, our 
deposits will grow to approximately $140 
billion after we acquire 100% of 
the Wealth Management joint venture. And we have a prudent disciplined 
strategy to deploy those deposits over the next three years.
 
Point number 6, so how does all this set up? Well, our 8% ROE and 9% ROT 
both excluding DVA
 
or solid start to the year; we expect that these levels 
will improve driven by the steps I've updated you on. The consistency of our 
returns is as important as the absolute level of our returns and we have 
made progress in this regard as well, particularl
y over the last several 
quarters. In addition, we believe many of the regulatory headwinds face the 
industry are already reflected in our results such as the cost of 
subsidiarization and because our growth areas of those that are unlikely to 
be much impact
ed by further regulation, our path is clearer.
 
In closing, I'd like to briefly touch on that Japanese business before I turn 
the call back to Ruth. Its top of mind because of the trip I made to Tokyo 
last week to meet with our partners. I saw firsthand the
 
impact of new 
monetary and fiscal policies on the markets there and the impact they're 
having on our business. Joint ventures with MUFG, Morgan Stanley MUFG 
Securities and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities are uniquely 
positioned in Japan to take a
dvantage of what is a macro resurgence due to 
the global client network and capabilities of Morgan Stanley and the 
domestic Japanese corporate and retail footprint of MUFG.
 
Combined, we have an unparalleled distribution in mediating invested capital 
flows 
into Japan and helping Japanese companies grow abroad. In Japan we 
have top three positions in equity and fixed income underwriting and M&A. 
As Japanese domestic firms consolidate their IBD market share, JV is 
differentiated as a domestic firm but truly un
ique origination capabilities. 
Outbound M&A volume was up significantly in 2012 and Japan became the 
number two acquirer nation globally versus number nine in 2009. We're also 
well positioned in sales and trading and have and will continue to benefit 
from 
cross
-
border flows into Japanese equities where we have a nearly 14% 
share in equity trading.
 
As we approach the third anniversary of the JV on May 1st, the financial 
contribution of Morgan Stanley continues to show positive momentum which 
we expect to con
tinue for some time and was worth calling out at this unique 
point in transition in Japan. So now let me get back to the broader results 
and particularly the first quarter and turn it over to Ruth. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GA
AP results and results excluding the 
effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures. The negative 
impact of DVA in the quarter was 370 million with 238 million in fixed 
income s
ales and trading and 79 million in equities sales and trading. 
Excluding the impact of DVA, online revenues were 8.5 billion, up 
approximately 13% versus the fourth quarter.
 
Non
-
interest expense was 6.5 billion, up 7% versus the fourth quarter. 
Compensatio
n expense was 4.2 billion this quarter which included 
approximately 132 million related to severance. Non
-
compensation expense 
was 2.3 billion, down 6% from last quarter. The effective tax rate from 
continuing operations for the first quarter was 21%. Excl
uding discrete 
items, the effective tax rate was about 30%.
 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders excluding DVA were approximately 1.2 billion. Earnings from 
continuing operations per diluted share were $0.61 
after preferred 
dividends. On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm
-
wide 
revenues for the quarter were 8.2 billion. Earnings from continuing 
operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were 977 
million. Reported earnings from cont
inuing operations per diluted share were 
$0.50 after preferred dividends.
 
Book value at the end of the quarter was $31.22 per share; tangible book 
value was $27.39 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $801 billion at March 31, 
up 
from $781 billion last quarter. Deposits were $81 billion consistent with 
fourth quarter levels. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was 
$186 billion compared with $182 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. 
$118 billion of our liquidity thi
s quarter was parent and non
-
bank liquidity 
versus $111 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. We increased our 

of the 35% stake in the Wealth Management joint venture.
 
With
 
respect to our capital ratios, as a reminder beginning this quarter the 
definition of Basel I capital ratios reflect the implementation of the Basel 

Basel 2.5. Although our calcula
tions are not final we believe that our Tier 1 
common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 11.5% and our Tier 1 
capital ratio with be approximately 13.9%. For the fourth quarter the pro 
forma Tier 1 common ratio under the new framework would be 10.6%.
 
Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $403 billion 
at March 31. Subject to final rule making and reflecting our best assessment 
of the rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 9.8% as 
of the end of the fir
st quarter.
 
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, 
revenues, excluding DVA, were $4.4 billion, up 22% sequentially. Non
-
interest expense was $3.3 billion, up 8% versus the fourth quarter. 
Compensation which included sever
ance of $113 million was $1.9 million for 
the first quarter, reflecting a 43% ratio excluding DVA. Excluding DVA and 
severance the compensation ratio was 40%. Non
-
compensation expense of 
$1.4 billion decreased 6% from last quarter. The business reported a 
pretax 
profit of $1.1 billion, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of 
DVA, the business reported a pretax profit of $830 million.
 
In investment banking, revenues of $945 million were down 23% versus last 
quarter. According to Thomson Reuters,
 
Morgan Stanley ranked #2 in global 
completed M&A, and #3 in global equity at the end of the first quarter. 
Notable transactions included in equity underwriting, Zoetis which raised 
$2.6 billion in its public offering, the largest IPO of the U.S. Company 
-
-
 
of a 
U.S. Company in almost a year. In advisory, Benckiser acquired DE Master 

joint leader ranger on committed financing to the bidder group. And in debt 
underwriting as joint b
ook runner we successfully priced $3.5 billion of 
senior unsecured notes for Intelsat, Luxembourg to refinance existing 
indebtedness.
 
Advisory revenues of $251 million were down versus our strong fourth 
quarter results due to lower industry wide volumes an
d timing of the 
recognition. Declines were primarily in the Americas. Equity underwriting 
revenues were $283 million up 19% versus the fourth quarter, driven by 
improved performance in the U.S. and Asia offset by declines in EMEA. 
Overall revenue mix for t
he market was less favorable in the quarter with 
fewer IPOs in greater block activity. Fixed income underwriting revenues 
reflected continued strong demand across products although our revenues of 
$411 million were down versus our record fourth quarter. Th
is quarter the 
market was more heavily driven by high
-
yield and leverage loans where our 
share has historically been lower versus investment grade where we have 
stronger positioning.
 
Equity, sales and trading revenues excluding DVA, were $1.6 billion, an 
i
ncrease of 14% from last quarter. Equity revenues were up broadly across 
products, regions and client segments versus the fourth quarter. Client 
revenues were the highest levels in over a year driven by market share 
gains and growth in prime brokerage bala
nces. Prime brokerage balance 
growth in fact outpaced the overall market due to greater balances from 
existing clients and from new business. Strength in our core businesses was 
partially offset by the PDT spin
-
off that was effective January 1, of this yea
r.
 
Fixed Income Commodities and Commodity sales and trading revenues, 
excluding DVA, were $1.5 billion. Revenues increased versus our fourth 
quarter results reflecting seasonal patterns, despite a period of challenging 
market conditions in March.
 
CVA, 
net of hedges, continued to be a drag this quarter in part due to the 
tightening of our credit spreads. Results in both macro and credit products 
were up versus the fourth quarter, driven by strong client activity. In 
general, clients focused on higher yie
lding products.
 
Credit corporates were up significantly as secondary trading volumes 
increased. Securitized products results outperformed due to very strong 
volume and several CMBS securitizations in the quarter.
 
Commodities sales and trading revenues cont
inued to be challenged by 
cyclical headwinds but were ahead of fourth quarter results. Other sales and 
trading revenues of 73 million compared with negative revenues of 34 
million last quarter. Average trading VAR for the first quarter was 72 million 
versu
s 78 million in the fourth quarter.
 
Turning to Global Wealth Management; revenues of 3.5 billion were up 4% 
versus the fourth quarter. Asset Management revenues were consistent with 
the fourth quarter reflecting comparable market levels at the beginning of
 
each period. Transaction revenues increased 15% from last quarter, 
consisting primarily of commissions of 559 million which increased 5% 
reflecting greater mutual fund activity despite fewer trading days versus the 
fourth quarter.
 
Investment Banking relat
ed fees of 274 million which increased 32% versus 
last quarter, driven by strong activity for closed
-
end funds and trading 
revenues of 298 million which were up 22% versus the fourth quarter, 
reflecting the impact of deferred compensation plans and higher 
fixed 
income revenues.
 
Net interest revenue increased 6% to 413 million, in part driven by higher 
average BDP balances and more efficient deployment of our investment 
portfolio. Non
-
interest expense was 2.9 billion, up 4% from last quarter. The 
compensatio
n ratio was 60% versus 57% in the fourth quarter, reflecting 
seasonally higher compensation expenses in the first quarter.
 
Non
-
compensation expense was 808 million, down 6% versus last quarter, 
reflecting continued expense discipline and the roll off of pl
atform integration 
expenses. The PBT margin was 17%.
 
Profit before tax was 597 million, the highest level of absolute profitability 
since the inception of the joint venture. Non
-
controlling interest was 121 
million, up from 103 million in the fourth quarte
r, reflecting stronger results 
in the joint venture.
 
Total client assets increased 6% to 1.8 trillion, reflecting higher market 
levels and inflows. Global fee
-
based asset inflows were 15.3 billion, fee
-
based assets under management increased to 621 billion
 
at quarter end. 
Global representatives were 16,284, essentially unchanged from the fourth 
quarter.
 
Bank deposits were 126 billion versus 131 billion at year
-
end, as clients 
began to shift back into the market in January. Approximately 69 billion is 
held i
n Morgan Stanley banks.
 
In Asset Management we continued to benefit from the steps we have taken 
to strengthen the business with higher revenues and another quarter of 
positive flows into fixed income funds, which is an area of focus for us.
 
In addition, a
s of March, in excess of 76% of our Long
-
Only strategies, 
excluding liquidity, outperformed their benchmarks over three, five and 10 
years. Specifically Asset Management revenues of 645 million were up 8% 
versus the fourth quarter, driven by higher marks a
nd growth in 
management and admin fees.
 
In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of 401 million were up from the 
fourth quarter, driven by higher global equity markets and continued 
positive net flows into the Long
-
Only Business, partially offset by outfl
ows in 
our liquidity funds.
 
In Real Estate Investing, revenues increased 24% versus the fourth quarter. 
Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these 
revenues are passed to third
-
party investors in the non
-
controlling interest 
line.
 
In Merchant Banking, revenues were down compared to the fourth quarter. 
Expenses were $458 million, up 21% from fourth quarter on higher 
compensation expense primarily due to DCP. Profit before tax was $187 
million, down 15% sequentially. NCI of $51 millio
n was essentially flat in the 
last quarter, total assets under management increased to $341 billion driven 
by market appreciation.
 
In terms of our outlook, a number of factors continue to support our 
expectation for healthy activity levels not withstanding
 
the persistent 
structural issue that must be addressed globally. In the U.S. positive 
economic data are encouraging with monetary policies supporting 
momentum despite the negative impact of the federal spending reductions 
rippling through the public and p
rivate sectors. Strong liquidity inflow 
supports both equity and credit market activity as evidenced for example by 
higher PB balances and the greater engagement by retail investors that was 
first evidenced in January.
 
In the euro zone there is work still 
to be done, however the market liquidity 
facilitated by the ECB has inspired some reentry by investors, a modest 
uptick from the low market volumes in prior periods. The Japanese market is 
clearly benefiting from a surge in investor and corporate activity 
on the back 
of the recent bold Central Bank moves there. Notably Japanese retail 
investors are still heavily in cash while many international investors are 
under weight the market, suggesting the potential for continued healthy 
activity.
 
On the corporate s
ide, global M&A dialogue is active, the CEO seem to 
require sustained evidence of economic strength to act. The periodic 
setbacks as evidenced in markets over the last several weeks remainders 
that global economic recovery and market healing may not come i
n a 
straight
-
line even if major economies are clearly on firmer putting just a 
year
-


position within institutional secu
rities, demonstrable upside in Wealth 

sheet is a source of strength driven by our success in doubling our capital 
base since 2010 and fundamentally improving both the quantum and 
durability of liquidity.
 
Thank you for joining us and James and I will now take your questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Guy Moszkowski 
with Autonomous.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Resea
rch LLP
 
Good morning.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Hi, Guy.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
So a handful of questions for you. The first one is I think we can see plenty 
of evidence of the cost management moving towards, capturing your $1.6 
billion 

through the year, your specific progress against the $1.6 billion?
 
Ruth Porat
 

compensation and our compensation expense
 
I think you know through 
2014 and predicated on a flat revenue scenario, so we do remain very 
comfortable with that target. There is some quarterly seasonality, so I think 
as we go through the year you will continue to see progress against the $1.6 
billio
n.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
Is there some way that maybe starting with next quarter you could actually 

 
Ruth Porat
 
We will try and highlight, so you can see the progress that we h
ave in other 

the goal.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
Okay, great. I think that will be helpful. Moving on to just the whole question 
of the risk
-
weighted assets and what
 
we saw happening in the fixed income 
business more broadly in the quarter, you 

 
what you call that rates and 
commodities as contributing to the year
-
over
-
year decline in fixed income 
revenues. But what we did see the commodities VaR come down quite a bit
 
if we measure year
-
over
-
year the rates bar was actually up pretty 
materially. Can you help us square that with both the revenue momentum 
and with the decline that you called out in terms of the FICC RWAs that got 
you ahead of your year
-
end targets by the 
end of the first quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. Obviously a couple of questions in that. So, within VaR the interest 
rate line is obviously both an interest rate and credit line and as you know 
that it was up year
-
over
-
year flat to the last quarter and its effe
ctive by 
couple of things. First and foremost is the measure of risk not necessarily 
correlated with revenues. It does pick up the activity in credit as you know 
that I call that out as an area that was quite strong for us both corporate 
credit and securit
ized products and mortgage business generally. So it's the 
function of the shape of the book and volatility of the market generally, but I 
think what we're looking at when you look at the total line is pretty 
consistent with prior period, prior year. I thi
nk you then had another 
question regarding risk
-
weighted assets.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
Yeah, I mean to the extent that risk
-
weighted assets are going to be driven 
in some measure by your stress VARs, I was just wondering if you could try
 
and reconcile for us the movement in VAR versus the decline in RWAs? And I 
guess the follow
-
up question on the RWAs is, if you already exceeded your 
year
-
end target, why stick with that as a target basically for the end of the 
year a couple billion more?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the reduction 

 
when we look at this reduction over the next period of 
time to 2016, it's ballpark 60% passive and 40% active. This quarter it was 
mostly passive. It benefited from the structured credit contract maturities, 
as James noted, bu
t it also reflected a change in the shape of the book and 
some other changes such as active mitigation. And our view is that we're 
very confident that we'll be at that year
-
end target of 255 billion if not lower, 
but given part of the reduction was the cha
nge in the shape of the book we 
just built in some degrees of flexibility over the year. And as I said, we're 
confident we're going to at least meet that year
-
end target. It may not be a 
straight
-
line down quarter
-
over
-
quarter just depending on the shape o
f the 
book to be higher in the second or third quarter. And again, we remain very 
committed to the reduction this year and taking it down to that sub
-
200 
level by 2016.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
Okay, thanks for that. And then just to sort o
f continue I guess along the 
same lines, you allocated a large part of the parent company capital down to 
ISG, 11 billion in the quarter, after holding a lot of that really at the parent 
for a pretty long time. Can you talk about what prompted the decision
? And 
is there anything about that move that kind of traps capital in the business 
in any way if in fact your RWA declines continue and you might otherwise 
free up capital?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the way we run the business and the way we look at capital is we real
ly 
won it with a Basel III lens. And as I think you know, we actually charged 
capital and liquidity down to the business unit 

 
for the product level, so we 
can look fully
-
loaded at risk
-
adjusted returns. The question then became 
over the last year or so i
s what do we do with parent capital given the rule 
for Basel II and a half and Basel III were still in flight and they hadn't been 
implemented. And our view was that once the Basel II and a half rules were 
implemented at the end of last year and so there w
as complete clarity on it, 
no guess work and what was being charged to the very segment, it was the 
appropriate time to take that parent capital number and allocate it up to the 
businesses. So consistent with moving our Tier 1 common ratio to the Basel 
II 
and a half metrics, we allocated the parent capital. And just to make sure 
it's clear because it can be confusing given the nomenclature. It is still Basel 
I even though it's using the market risk rules under Basel II and a half, our 
fourth quarter '12 Bas
el I number was 14.6, the Basel II and a half for the 
fourth quarter was 10.6. So if you're looking at where our Basel I ratios were 
last quarter under an apples
-
to
-
apples basis to Basel II and a half 10.6 last 
quarter going to 11.5 this quarter consistent
 
with reporting ratios that way, 
parent capital has allocated into the businesses. And then to your very good 
question of does that mean that there is trapped capital, as we think about 
the businesses we look at a 

 
again, a Basel III lens with that [SIFY]
 
buffer 
and then above that, we believe we have degrees of flexibility with respect 
to capital return and we're continuing to build that Basel III ratio based on 
that capital accretion from earnings as well as the capital optimization 
through things like t
he risk
-
weighted asset reduction and so that does give 
us greater degree of flexibility.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
Okay, that's a very helpful description. Thanks. I'll just ask one more which 
is the Moody's announcement and conference call 
a couple of weeks back, 
kind of puts into focus that Morgan Stanley still has a lot of its derivates 
booked held outside of the bank unit and I was wondering if given what 
they're talking about doing, that pushes you to try to move more into the 
bank to th
e extent that you can?
 
Ruth Porat
 


prior calls and move old foreign exchange derivatives into the bank and we 
d
o plan to write new interest rates derivatives into the bank this year and 
timing and speed is really a function of some of the regulatory processes. 


on Morgan Stanley for greater quality and 

changes to the business mix and funding on calls like this with clients and 
counterparties which really all go to the strength of our stand
alone credit 

in the business mix for example with fixed income, it really moved more 
towards cash than derivatives, and so that puts us in a good spot. And 
obviously the industry cha
nged as well in the past year with adjustments 
post the ratings action. So, it would mute the impact of anything that maybe 
done on the ratings front, but I think the main thing is our 

 
we think that 

credit profile.

The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Hello.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Hi, Glenn.
 
Glenn 
Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Just one quickie follow
-

like it had much of an impact on revenues. I just want to make sure that 

 
I 
clarify that point.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Correct. The majority of it was passi
ve. The active was P&L neutral, and on 

out the revenue and risk.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Okay, great. And then on commodities; it's been a tough revenue backdrop 
for everybody given the lower trending prices. I just want to make sure that 
you still feel this is mostly cyclical trending lower oil and things like that and 

 
Ruth Porat
 
Our view i
s that, it is a cyclical headwind as you said, it continued 
backwardation and it won't turn on a dime. Cyclical changes can take time to 
turn, but it is cyclical. It affects opportunities for us. It affects opportunities 
for clients related to in particula
r structured solutions which benefited us last 
year, but we do view it as cyclical.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Got you. And in terms of the physical oil, you tend to hedge that at all times, 
correct?
 
Ruth Porat
 

positions. We hedge our physical inventory.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Super. And last one is, there were some not overly 

 
not that big but modest 
shifts of revenues and expenses in the reporting from last quarter from 
Wealth Management to 
the institutional securities group, I mean had a drop 
of an effect on 

 
positive effect on the margin. But the real impact on the 
margin besides the good markets was a core drop in non
-
comp at Wealth 
Management. And I just want to see is that a function of
 
the systems 
integration cost running off and this is good run rate to run with?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, a couple of things. In terms of the international Wealth Management 
market and you nailed it, it's a small move. If you look at the supplement 
from the fourth q
uarter to now, it's about a 10 basis point difference, so a 
small portion of the 

 
a small difference. In terms of the overall margin, I 

underwriting activity. In particular closed
-
end f
und activity was very 
favorable last quarter and that helped on the top line. So, that you can 

a positive. Expenses clearly we have remained focused on and the 
integration being done 


forward to the second quarter assume expense is pretty much hold at that 
level, not withstanding the fact that we remain tight 
on expense discipline, 

-
end fund new issue activity hard to forecast. We do 
see new issues activity generally a lot of that is outside the U.S. and the real 
catalyst comes from the U.S. At the same time the S&P is about 10% higher 
than
 
at the end of the first quarter which benefited our fee based revenues. 
I think those two revenue items sort of offset one and other. And so at this 

where it is although you can se

continuing to push.
 
Glenn Schorr

The next question will come from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Credit Suisse AG
 
Hi, good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Morning.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
On the remainder of the MS/SB volume, what specific approval are you 
waiting for from the Fed regarding that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We've gon
e through obviously the CCAR which is a capital approval and 
gotten the non
-
objection there and then the approval Dodd
-
Frank process 
approval. We did the same thing last year when we did the 14% buy
-
in. 
That approval 

 
so it's process approval versus capit
al approval, that 
approval last year came in May which wasn't really as relevant for timing 
because we didn't have the call until June and then we went through the 
arbitration process which took it out basically to the end of the summer. And 
I'm not sugges
ting they can read anything into that May date but it's the 
only proxy we have for what that timeline was at least last year.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Great, thanks for reviewing that, Ruth. And then James, speaking of the 
CCAR, the test results came
 
in a bit 

 
your own test results came in a bit 
below down to the Fed and I just wanted to get your thoughts on what you 
believe drove that difference? What's in your control to maybe bridge that 
gap going forward? And how does it impact timing and quantum
 
of the next 
stage of capital return post the buy
-
in?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Why don't I start on some of the technical? I think you're pointing in 
particular to our PPNR versus the Fed, which you could see in the disclosure. 
Our understanding is that the Fed had its 
own model which relies on historic 
data and given we've invested meaningfully to increase the quality and 
consistently of earnings, there have been charges that have obviously been 
going through the P&L such as MBIA which are negatives and short 
financials
, but on a go
-
forward basis eliminated drag, improved the quality 
and consistently of results. And so it's understandable there's a difference 
between the two if one forecast is based on historic results on the impact 
and the other is looking at a fundamen
tally different business mix. We don't 
know the extent to which those historic results in the Fed model were 
adjusted and so it's hard to know precisely how the models are different. But 
that in our view is one of the key things that we're focused on worki
ng on 
over the next period of time before the next submission to (inaudible). That 
being said if you just look at our fourth quarter earnings and our first 
quarter earnings, the first two quarters of the CCAR submission that would 
add an additional 60 basi
s points to our ratios. So we will be focused on 
dealing with the PPNR differences and methodology. We are continuing to 
accrete capital and we think that that does continue to give us degrees of 
flexibility.
 
James P. Gorman
 
And I think Howard, the differe
nce between what we submitted and believed 
the models should throw out and what ultimately came out of the black box 
that is the CCAR process was actually narrower 

 
the difference was 
narrower than what it was last year. We've obviously got better at it a
nd I 
think it was relative to some of the other firms out there was frankly not a 
very surprising result. So we'll play this forward. Our focus now is getting 
the Smith Barney which we got the capital approved.

Understood, th
anks. And then quick numbers on Ruth. I realized 

 
you said 
that RWA reduction this quarter was P&L neutral, but what's driving the 
other sales and trading results. It seems to be less of a headwind than it was 
in the past.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, it's a number o
f items that does move around and it's difficult to 
model. It includes things like our long
-
term debt hedging program and our 
bank liquidity portfolio, our loan book, DCP. So it's kind of an aggregation of 
a number of different items.

Crédit 
Suisse AG
 
Okay, thanks. And then just finally from me, it remains a pretty fragile 
environment for you and peers within the Institutional Securities business. I 
was just hoping you could comment on overall attrition levels, both 
absolutely and relative to 
your expectations? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think that beginning of the year and having some departures is not in any 
way unusual. We actually feel very good about the strength of the team. 
We've got a very talented senior team, been together for many 
years. We've 
hired and think it's a great time at Morgan Stanley to be adding senior 
talent. People are excited to join given the clarity of where we're going and 
the momentum moving in that direction. So it's kind of seasonal and we 
don't read anything in
to it.
 
James P. Gorman
 
And more specifically, the attrition is actually trekking along exactly what it 
was last year. And I believe and Celeste will correct me later, a little low 
than what it was the year before.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.

Hi. I guess my questions can be grouped into the good, bad and the ugly; so 
I'll start with 
the ugly. Financial advisory, if you look at it linked quarter or 
year
-
over
-
year among the five largest U.S. players, it looks to perform the 
worst based on fees and you had some management changes there. Can 
you reassure that franchise is still as strong 

 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, it is. The M&A lead tables are exactly the same as they were last year, 
it tends to be lumpy in the first quarter and particular given market 

a very 
strong M&A franchise as I noted in my comments, part of it is just that lower 
volume and it tends to be lumpy and part of it we had a very strong fourth 
quarter and there were some fee realization that moved in 

 
within the 
fourth quarter, so that p
artially explains it as well, but we feel very good 

year and last year it [dwells] throughout the year.
 
Michael Mayo

CLSA Asia

Pacific Markets
 
And then in my bad category the 

to do that, but trading at such a big discounted tangible book if you have 
confidence in the value of your balance sheet, which I assume you do, why 

ot be more 
aggressive with your big targets? Why not take some other action to 
strength to move up that Basel III ratio even faster?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Well, I think Mike there are couple of questions meshed together there. I 
think the actions on reducing our
 
risk
-
weighted assets and fixed income 


the years point already in the first quarter of this year, it 
would be easy to 
reduce it faster, but you would also destroy revenues and destroy good 
businesses. So, our job is to balance a sensible risk
-
weighted asset 
reduction without destroying revenues and parts of that business that we 
find very attractive. So, 

bringing it down from $390 billion to a committed sub $200 billion by 2016. 


 
The capital buyback is completely diffe
rent topic. The 

 
as we said at the 
beginning of the year, we adopted a very clear posture with our regulators, 
which was that our focus was on the strategic benefits of buying Smith 
Barney for two reasons. One, it was an attractive business and being alre
ady 
carrying the effective cost of the capital for that business, so we wanted the 
earnings from it. And its $600 million pre
-
tax a quarter, 35% is real money. 

focus. We did not wa
nt to jeopardize that focus by prejudging where we 
come out on CCAR or prejudging how the beginning of the year would start. 
The beginning of the year has started at $1.2 billion, significantly above 
where we were in the fourth quarter as CCAR came out at 
5.7, I think 5.6 

reserves to go through the application process. When they do that we know 
our number and as we go through the year, obviously the next question 

 
is when and under what conditions we have to see 

-



re now well on that path.
 
Michael Mayo

CLSA Asia

Pacific Markets
 
And then the good category would be the brokerage margin which came in 
higher than what you guys had expected last quarter. What is your 
brokerage margin target? Is it still 15%, it seems p
retty low and you had 
one peer yesterday reported margin over 20%. So what are you really trying 
to achieve margin wise in that business?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Well, I have to take that one again Mike, because I was the one who 
foolishly couple of years ago went
 
out with a 20% margin when we had then 
three years of zero interest rates following out. So I admitted to my mistake 
on that and we set a more conservative margin target for the middle of this 

 

certainly not going to turnaround and reset margins based upon short
-
term 


those margins. The co

to observe that they actually have a different business mix that comprises 
that ultimate margin number.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA Asia
-
Pacific Markets
 
Was there anything unusual with the 17% margin this quarter
 
or can we 
consider that a base looking ahead?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, there was nothing unusual. As I said the strength versus what is usually 
a seasonally lower margin, it's typically seasonally low because 
compensation expense tends to be a bit higher in the fir
st quarter. But what 
we had offsetting that, as I noted, was the stronger transactional volume, 
the new issue activity with closed
-
end funds. That really helped coupled with 
the ongoing expense discipline. And so if we look forward, you're starting 
with th
e good base in the first quarter was at 17%.

The next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
 
Matthew H. Burnell

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
 
Good
 
morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions. 
First of all, on the deposits, you saw about 4% decline in deposits in Wealth 
Management, I think overall 3% down. Was that largely seasonal or was 
there something else going on there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Deposits came up in December. We saw some selling out of the markets. We 
think it was primarily tax driven by investors as distinct from real concern 
about the market. But our expectation was that it would come back into the 
market in the beginn
ing of the first quarter and it did. So it's really just the 
positioning by investors at the end of last year, then coming back into the 
market and staying in the market as they have. So no, there's not anything 
more to it than that.
 
Matthew H. Burnell 
-
 
W
ells Fargo Securities, LLC
 
Okay. And then just thinking about your debt underwriting business, given 
that there's obviously been pretty strong demand for that product over the 
last couple of years, you've admitted that you're a little bit subscale on high 
yields relative to some of your competitors. Does that have any effect on 
your desire for a couple 100 basis points of market share gains within fixed 
income if that business continues to be relatively robust over the next couple 
of years?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. W
e set a target of 2% market share increase, kind of 8% total market 
share for fixed income sales and trading. We feel very confident with that 
given the products that our fixed income underwriting, which is actually 
reported 

 
those sales are reported in t
he investment banking line and we 
did have a record 

 
we had a record quarter last quarter. The first quarter 
was actually the best ever first quarter that we've had. What that ends up 
driving is the secondary sales and trading as you know well, but we fee
l very 
good about 

 
we remain very much focused on our share gains, equally 
focused on how we optimize returns. So it's really both of those, but no 
change.
 
Matthew H. Burnell 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
 
Okay. And then let me just confirm finally; the 60
% compensation ratio in 
Wealth Management, you mentioned last quarter that that we should about 
that ratio being pretty unchanged for the next couple of quarters. What 
would allow you to get that ratio down presuming a steady revenue 
environment? And is th
at something that we should be looking for towards 
the end of the year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The 60% compensation ratio in the first quarter is precisely the reason we 
had indicated that the margin tends to be seasonally weaker in the first 
quarter, these tend to ha
ve fairly higher comp in the first quarter or things 
like FICA and other factors. So it does tend to be a bit higher. Coming down 
a point or so near term is very 

 
it's a reasonable way to think about it, but 
the great 

 
the best driver of the comp ratio o
ver time is really the growth of 
our lending product. As we talked about, we're going to have deposits up to 
about 140 billion in the two years, post buying in the rest of the Wealth 
Management business. That's going to support growth of both Wealth 
Manage
ment lending product and Institutional product. And on the Wealth 
Management side, it's on a different compensation grid relative to the 
[formulate] grid that generally drives that comp ratio and that is what really 
gives us meaningful operating leverage i
n the comp line and that brings it 
down to the high 50s.

The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
 
James Mitchell

Buc
kingham Research
 
Hi. Good morning.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
Just want to follow
-
up on 

 
you're sitting on about 23% of your balance 
sheet in excess liquidity. Can you discuss where you are sitting in terms of 
the L
CR, do you feel like you're pretty comfortable for that or do you need to 
build more?
 
Ruth Porat
 
On the LCR, we're over 125% and that really has given all that we've done 
terming out the secured book. It's obviously just a 30
-
day test and we do 
triangulate
, as we've talked about on some prior calls, with an outlook over 
12
-
month period of time in a stress environment. One of the reasons 
liquidity is running at these higher levels as I noted, is that we want to 
ensure that we have ample liquidity assuming we
 
do acquire the 35% of 

 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
Okay, maybe just to follow
-
up on 
--
 
as you buy in the rest, should we 
--
 
what is the timing around the deposits and how quickly do yo
u think you can 
reinvest, and then I guess longer term do you think that can help you bring 
down the excess liquidity and obviously help to improve profitability?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, the deposits, the way it works is, they come in over the two
-
year period 
of ti
me. We get about 14 billion of deposits within a few weeks of closing, 
and then 40 billion ratably over the following 24 months. And that will 
--
 
that supports as I just said both retail lending as well as institutional 
lending. And I think the best way to
 
think about it is, one it gives us growth 


funded with unsecured debt versus substantially more efficient depos
its, but 


real
-
estate those are good examples of areas where we get our incremental 
growth opportunities based on o
ur competencies today and our clients 
today, but it would be funded with more efficient deposits in the bank. And 
then there are also areas where we will be able to move businesses from 
institutional securities into the bank and that enabled us to do it do
llar
-
for
-
dollar substitution, reducing unsecured debt and replacing that with deposit 
funding which is more efficient. And so yes there is some efficiency that 
comes in, in that way. And then overall if the question is also and what does 
that do for liquid
ity. As those deposits which are currently really supporting 
the AFS portfolio go into support the lending product the bank liquidity 
comes down as those are moving into support loan growth.
 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
So we should see that 
excess liquidity start to come down, as those deposits 
come in?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yeah, it's all 

 
if you take a look over time the answer to that is yes, but as 

 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Re
search
 
Oh, sure. Right, in the short
-
term it could go up.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It goes up; then it goes into the AFS portfolio; it's positive carry on the AFS 
portfolio as it comes down again because it's supporting loan growth. Yes, it 
does come down again but at a
 
higher return.
 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
Right. Okay, thanks a lot.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks.

The final question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Knocking under the wire. Good mor
ning, guys.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Brennan, good morning.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
So, just a quick follow
-
up on FICC, it was obviously pretty volatile in some of 
these markets here this quarter. Is there an
y, which we think about maybe 
the fact that revenue might have been a little bit lower than usual just 
because there might have been some principal loss given some of that 
volatility and this is actually really a pretty lousy run rate?
 
Ruth Porat
 
You know 
the run rate we do think given the markets where more 
challenging especially in March just affected activity and as I noted rates 

talked about. So, I think it is very fair to say we 


with quarterly seasonality. And you know I point you to the strength that we 
have in a lot of areas like credit and the mortgage product and foreign 
ex


 
rates are higher, so we do think that 
given the strength of the client activity levels that there is upside from here. 
I think an interesting way to even just look at client activity and volumes 
across the platform is jus
t looking at the brokerage and clearing line which is 

think that $1.5 billion in revenues is a ceiling and look forward to the 
continued activity.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investme
nt Bank, Research Division
 
But where there any principal losses to specifically highlight or was it mostly 
volume driven within the FICC line?
 
Ruth Porat
 
It was not principal losses, no.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay, great. Thanks. And on capital, once I understand that its uncertain 
about when you get the green light on MSSB, but if we assume that happens 
prior to mid
-
year, is it too aggressive for us to think about given where you 
guys are on the capital ratio 
front. In fact at MSSB is already fully baked into 
Basel III that you could be looking to take a second bite of the apple here 
with the regulators in a potential buyback with a 

 
with the new submission?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well as James said, our number one focus 
is closing the Wealth Management 
acquisitions, given the strategic benefit in the upside, promoting 100%. So, 
we're just focused on closing that acquisition, which was our capital 
progress. We are accreting capital. Your question is fair, but we want to ge
t 
it closed before we think about anything else.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
I figured I'd give that a shot. And then the last one. The lending platform, is 
there anything operationally that you guys are waiting on to get going 
because it seems as though you have excess deposits currently. So it's not 
really a matter of funding and not having the right funding. So, is there like 
a system investment process you need to go through in order to get 
everything up and running? Or is th
ere any operational issues holding you 
back? Do you want to have all of MS/SB completely bought in before you 
really start more aggressively pushing the lending platform? I guess I don't 
understand what's 

 
why it's been so slow to ramp so far?
 
Ruth Porat
 
In 2009, it became clear that over time we would be buying in the 
remainder of the Wealth Management business, and at that point started 
investing in the systems, the risk management personnel, analytics to 
ensure that at the point we ended up with the ful
l 140 billion in place, we 
had the systems and infrastructure requirements there. The gating factor is 
and we've used this word so often in describing how we're building up the 
banking team and the banking effort within Wealth Management its prudent 
consis
tent growth. There is no reason to rush it. We want to make sure that 
we do it in a high quality way and that we're leading with risk management. 
So, it is better to do it prudently over time than to try and rush it. That is 
really the governor of the grow
th in that business. We feel good about the 
strength and the build. As James said, it's both on the mortgage side and on 
the PLA side and that's what we're continuing to do.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I will no
te one other thing, we've said this I think last quarter that relative to 
our peers we are under penetrated in the lending product, and so what we're 
seeing is good take up and we're just keeping it at a measured pace.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank,
 
Research Division
 
Okay. At some point after that book assuming that you guys want to grow 
that book to a certain size. Does that mean that there will be a transition to 
accrual accounting and we'll start to see sort of that level of detail for you 
all?
 
Ru
th Porat
 
Well, so we talked about the fact a couple of quarters 

 
I think over a year 
ago now that we moved from fair value to HFI for our lending products, 
that's most relevant for what we're doing on the institutional side. And at 
this point, about 69% o
f the book is on HFI. So that has been the approach 
that was very clear coming out of the CCAR process over a year ago that 
that was a logical way to approach it and that's what we've been doing 
systematically.

James P. Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. As we say goodbye to 2011, 
we are 
happy to report that our prospects are much better going forward 
than they have at any point since I became CEO 2 years ago. Let me briefly 
review the year and share our outlook.
 
We know 
--
 
as you all know, we had a disappointing start to 2011 when we 
suff
ered a considerable loss in the Japanese joint venture. However, it 
proves to be a positive catalyst because it helped MUFG and ourselves 
reevaluate our partnership and determine that we should take steps to align 
the 2 companies more closely. The result w
as the creation of what I believe 
is one of the most exciting partnerships in the global financial services 
industry. The partnership bore abundant fruit in 2011, including the 
conversion of the preferred into common; the elimination of the preferred 
divid
end, and now MUFG equity counts through our earnings; MUFG now has 
2 board seats; the enhancement of a loan marketing agreement for the 
Americas; and we're continuing to look for other ways to expand this 
partnership around the world. All of these show our
 
commitment to each 
other for decades to come in good times and in bad. Now taking you through 
this in detail, because I believe our deeper relationship is perhaps the most 
underappreciated of all the strategic moves that have taken place.
 
On the business 
front, we had terrific progress against our goals in 2011. In 
particular, look at equities. The growth in our share in equities, where we 
increased wallet significantly, with a more than 300 basis point increase in 
the first 9 months.
 
We grew share in Fixe
d Income. We also increased our wallet share in this 
business, as has been our focus, while deemphasizing certain parts of 
securitized products and other Basel III capital
-
intensive areas.
 
We grew our share in Investment Banking capital markets, where we 
a
chieved 100 basis point improvement in overall wallet share and significant 
positions in all of the rankings. We improved our margin and flows in Smith 
Barney.
 
While margin improved modestly for the year to 10%, net managed flows 
were the highest since the
 
inception of the JV at $43 billion.
 
We are now moving to the final stages of integration of MSSB. Our 
technology platform will be fully integrated this summer.
 
We revitalized MSIM, which is evident in the flows in that business for the 
year and our moment
um exiting the fourth quarter after several years of 
outflows.
 
Finally, we restored Research through its preeminent place in the industry, 
where we have seen improved Greenwich rankings and II rankings through 
the year.
 
On the organization front, we sought
 
stability in management and a 
successful transition among our senior team. That has been done.
 
On the legacy front, we resolved the last major significant issue for us, 
MBIA, which was settled through the difficult decision to take a loss of $1.7 
billion.
 
But most importantly, in the process, we freed up approximately $5 
billion of capital pro forma under Basel III.
 
We also continue to tightly risk
-
manage our exposure to the periphery, with 
exposures before hedges well below where we ended the third quarte
r. Ruth 
will review this with you in detail in a minute.
 
In addition, we've reshaped our balance sheet. Consistent with our 
commitment to you when I took this job, we exited 2011 with no outside 
risks and have fortified with a much stronger balance sheet.
 
With regards to compensation, 2011 represented a high
-
water mark for our 
deferrals due to the unusual aggregation of prior periods into this year. We 
are acutely aware of the impact of deferral decisions on future periods. But 
with the last year behind us,
 
we will have more flexibility in the years to 
come.
 
Ruth will address the meaningful progress we made with respect to capital, 
funding and liquidity. But let me end with a few brief comments. First, this 
management team was determined to clear the decks o
f significant legacy 
issues and material exposures from 2008 and prior years. And we have done 
that. For the first time in 2 years, our to
-
do list is not our problem list, and 
we can focus our energies on enhancing our franchise. Second, this 
management te
am is determined to gain share in the businesses we have 
chosen to remain in, and we are doing that. In addition, we're assuming we 
come to acceptable terms, we would look to purchase the next 14% of 
MSSB.
 
Finally, this management team is resolute in its g
oal to generate acceptable 
and clean returns in quarters and years ahead. The recent decision to 
execute a reduction in force of 1,600 employees, as well as the ongoing 
reshaping of Fixed Income, are examples of important steps to achieving 
better performa
nce on a sustainable basis.
 
We cannot control the accounting noise of DVA, the movement of 
counterparty spreads, the capital requirements imposed by our regulators or 
the evolving Dodd
-
Frank regulatory framework. However, there is a 
tremendous amount that 
we can and do control, and we will remain nimble, 
highly focused and disciplined in doing so. 2011 was a very difficult year for 
the markets and for the financial services. We are very glad to have it 
behind us. Although the markets remain fragile, Morgan 
Stanley is 
dramatically better positioned than it was just 12 months ago.
 
With that, I'll now turn over to Ruth to take you through our earnings in 
greater detail.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. As James said, we are particularly pleased this quarter with 
the st
eps we have taken to address legacy issues and position the firm for 
the future. Given the magnitude of the loss associated with the MBIA 
settlement, a $1.7 billion reduction to revenue and approximately $0.59 to 
EPS, to simplify comparisons to prior perio
ds, I will provide reported 
numbers but then also provide certain amounts excluding the impact of the 
loss to help with comparability. Additionally, I will provide data with and 
without the impact of DVA.
 
Our firm
-
wide revenues for the fourth quarter were 
$5.7 billion, down 42% 
sequentially on a reported basis and down 15% when excluding DVA in both 
periods. DVA in the quarter was $216 million. Excluding the MBIA loss and 
DVA in both periods, revenues of $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter were up 
12% over t
he third quarter. Our noninterest expenses were $6.2 billion, 
virtually unchanged from last quarter. The firm
-
wide compensation ratio was 
67% in the quarter compared to 37% in the third quarter. Excluding the 
effect of DVA in both quarters and the MBIA los
s this quarter, the ratio was 
53% in the fourth quarter versus 57% in the third quarter. We expect to 
incur $150 million of severance expense due to the recently completed 
reduction in force that James mentioned.
 
Non
-
compensation expenses were $2.4 billion
, down 6% from last quarter. 
Although we have historically experienced a seasonal increase in non
-
compensation expenses in the fourth quarter, firm
-
wide discipline resulted in 
the sequential and year
-
over
-
year declines.
 
Overall for the quarter, income from
 
continuing operations applicable to 
Morgan Stanley was a loss of approximately $227 million. Net loss from 
continuing operations per diluted share was $0.14 after preferred dividends. 
DVA positively affected our results by approximately $0.06 per share. A
nd as 
I mentioned, the MBIA loss negatively impacted our results by $0.59 per 
share. Period
-
end shares outstanding were 1.93 billion, while our diluted 
average shares outstanding were 1.85 billion. Book value at the end of the 
quarter was $31.42 per share 
and tangible book value was $27.95 per 
share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $750 billion at December 31, 
down from $795 billion last quarter, reflecting lower client activity. The 
liquidity pool was $182 billion at the end of the quarter 
and has remained at 
or above those levels, even after paying down $2.5 billion of debt in early 
January. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 
common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 13% versus 13.1% in the 
third quar
ter, and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 16.6% versus 
15.1% in the third quarter. Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected 
to be approximately $316 billion at December 31. The change in RWAs from 
last quarter reflects the impact of th
e MBIA settlement, our move away from 
RWA
-
intensive businesses and the reduction in the balance sheet.
 
You'll note that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I is down slightly from 
last quarter despite the significant reduction in our RWAs. This was 
driven by 
2 adjustments to Tier 1 common. First, the dilutive impact of the MBIA 
transaction under Basel I, as we indicated when we announced the MBIA 
settlement. Second, a release by the Federal Reserve in December in which 
the regulatory definition of Ti
er 1 common capital was formalized to require 
the reduction of goodwill and nonservicing intangible assets associated with 
non
-
controlling interests. This means that we deduct $4.2 billion of goodwill 
associated with MSSB and NCI. There is no impact to our
 
Basel III ratios 
from this change because our current and future estimates of Basel III 
capital reflect the deduction of NCI.
 
We continue to build our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III, which was 
approximately 8% pro forma as of the end of the fourth qu
arter. Assuming 
full Basel III inflation of RWAs, no benefit from mitigation and unfavorable 
treatment of NCI. In addition, we expect to have a Tier 1 common ratio 
under Basel III of close to 10% at the end of 2012, reflecting passive 
mitigation driven by 
position rolloffs and consensus earnings.
 
Now turning to our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, reported 
revenues of $2.1 billion were down 68% from last quarter, including the 
$1.7 billion negative impact related to the MBIA loss that flow
ed through our 
Fixed Income business. Excluding the impact of DVA in both periods and the 
MBIA loss this quarter, revenues were up 20% sequentially. Noninterest 
expenses were $2.9 billion, down 4% from the third quarter. The 
compensation ratio was 75% in t
he quarter. Excluding the impact of DVA 
and the MBIA loss, the ratio was 43%. Non
-
compensation expenses declined 
10%. The business reported a pretax loss of $779 million.
 
Turning to Investment Banking. Our results reflect our strong market 
positions agains
t the backdrop of generally low market activity, resulting in 
revenues of $883 million, up slightly versus last quarter. At the end of the 
fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in 
global completed M&A, #2 in global announce
d M&A and #2 in both global 
equity and global IPOs. Notable transactions included Kinder Morgan's $39 
billion acquisition of El Paso Corporation, Groupon's $805 million IPO and 
Amgen's $6 billion investment
-
grade debt offering.
 
Advisory revenues of $406 mi
llion were roughly flat to the third quarter as 
higher revenues in the Americas offset lower results in EMEA. Equity 
underwriting revenues were $189 million, down 21% versus the third 
quarter, driven in particular by lower activity in Europe.
 
Fixed income 
underwriting revenues of $288 million increased 36% from last 
quarter. Results primarily reflected a higher loan syndication activity and 
investment
-
grade bond revenues.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues of $1.3 billion included negative DVA of 
$23 million
 
and were down 36% versus last quarter on a reported basis. 
Excluding DVA, revenues were down 5% sequentially and were up 8% from 
a year ago.
 
Although market volumes and liquidity declined in the fourth quarter with 
the Eurozone crisis weighing on client a
ctivity, our client revenues remained 
relatively resilient, and we successfully navigated the turmoil. The fourth 
quarter results capped a strong year overall for the equities business. 
Specifically, cash equities and electronic trading volumes, in particu
lar, 
outperformed broader market volumes. After 3 sequential record quarters, 
derivatives were down in a seasonally weaker period. Prime brokerage 
revenues similarly reflected typical fourth quarter seasonality and lower 
market levels in the quarter. The n
umber of clients remained unchanged 
from the prior quarter and up from the prior year.
 
Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading negative revenues of $257 
million included positive DVA of $239 million and the negative $1.7 billion 
impact from the MBIA
 
loss. Revenues were down 107% on a reported basis. 
Excluding DVA in both periods and the MBIA loss this quarter, revenues were 
up 13% versus last quarter and up 52% versus a year ago. We continue to 
increase share in our focus areas and position the busin
ess for Basel III. The 
investment in our rates franchise maintained its momentum with revenues 
up modestly sequentially and up materially year
-
over
-
year. FX results were 
modestly lower than last quarter and up significantly year
-
over
-
year.
 
Our credit busin
esses recovered from a weak performance in Q3 but were 
still down materially versus the year ago. Commodities revenues were lower 
due to unseasonably mild Northern Hemisphere temperatures and slower 
global GDP growth. Results in the Fixed Income business w
ere positively 
affected by the release of credit valuation adjustments due to the 
restructuring of certain peripheral exposures. The other sales and trading 
line reflects revenues of $83 million versus a loss in the third quarter.
 
Turning to VAR. Average V
AR decreased from $130 million in the third 
quarter to $123 million this quarter using a 4
-
year data series. Period
-
end 
VAR declined from $143 million at the end of Q3 to $87 million at the end of 
Q4. Total trading VAR was down at period end in large part 
due to the MBIA 
settlement closing towards the end of the quarter. Related positions were 
captured in credit portfolio VAR. Our average aggregated VAR by primary 
risk category for the quarter was $66 million versus $93 million in the third 
quarter, reflect
ing reduced activity, particularly in credit products.
 
Global Wealth Management revenues of $3.3 billion were roughly flat to the 
prior quarter, in a period marked by low client volume and a headwind of 
lower market levels at the end of the third quarter. 
Specifically, Asset 
Management revenues were down 7% because fees are based on asset 
levels at the close of the prior quarter. GWM's Investment Banking
-
related 
fees were relatively flat to last quarter, in line with the firm's underwriting 
revenues. Tradin
g revenues were up significantly versus Q3, primarily driven 
by markups in deferred compensation plans, although it is important to note 
that this increase was offset nearly 1
-
for
-
1 in the compensation expense 
line. Commissions were down 6% from last quart
er, reflecting reduced levels 
of client activity. The other revenue line includes lower realized AFS gains 
compared to the prior quarter. Net interest was up 12% sequentially, 
attributable to the continued buildout of our lending business and 
performance o
f our investment portfolio. Noninterest expenses were $3 
billion, up 4% from last quarter.
 
The compensation ratio of 64% in the quarter continues to be driven 
primarily by the formulaic payout grid but was elevated this quarter by the 
revenue mix, certain 
year
-
end adjustments and severance charges. Non
-
compensation expenses were $932 million, up from $896 million in the third 
quarter, reflecting seasonality and more normalized FDIC expenses, as I 
mentioned on our last earnings call. Integration costs were a
pproximately 
$73 million in the quarter.
 
Profit before tax was $244 million, while the PDT margin was 8%, which 
reflected the revenue mix and the expense movement I mentioned. NCI for 
the quarter was $16 million, down from $52 million in the third quarter.
 
Total client assets increased to $1.6 trillion due to market appreciation and 
net asset inflows of $6 billion in the quarter. Global fee
-
based asset flows 
were $4.9 billion. Fee
-
based assets under management grew to $496 billion 
at quarter end, up 6% year
-
over
-
year. Global fee
-
based asset inflows for the 
full year were $43 billion, the highest since the inception of the JV. We are 
focused on growing this portion of flows because they enable to us deliver 
the best of our content to clients while building st
able fee revenue and are 
more relevant to the economics of the business.
 
Global representatives at quarter end were 17,156, down just over 130 
sequentially. In preparing for the move of Smith Barney advisors onto the 
new platform, we reviewed and harmonize
d role definitions for Morgan 
Stanley and Smith Barney FAs, resulting in an increase of approximately 500 
in the FA count as shown in our supplement as global representatives 
adjusted. Our disclosure going forward will provide the FA count using the 
new me
thodology. Turnover in our top 2 quintiles was at the lowest level 
since the fourth quarter of 2009. Bank deposits were $111 billion at the end 
of the quarter with approximately $56 billion held in Morgan Stanley Banks.
 
Turning to Asset Management. Revenue
s of $424 million were up from $205 
million in the third quarter, due primarily to markups in the Merchant 
Banking and Real Estate funds this quarter versus sizable markdowns last 
quarter. In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of $290 million were flat
 
to the third quarter. In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $111 million 
compared favorably to the prior quarter, which included markdowns on 
investments. Given the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of 
these revenues are passed to third
-
par
ty investors in the non
-
controlling 
interest line. In Merchant Banking, revenues of $23 million were up from 
third quarter results, which included markdowns related to declines in global 
markets.
 
Compensation expense was $183 million in the quarter, up fro
m $132 
million in the third quarter, driven primarily by favorable markups in 
deferred compensation plans. Profit before taxes was $78 million. NCI was 
$44 million versus negative $18 million last quarter, again reflecting 
markups in funds versus markdowns
 
in Q3. Total AUM increased $19 billion 
sequentially to $287 billion, driven by net asset inflows of $15 billion and 
market appreciation. Net asset inflows included $8 billion of net inflows into 
AIP funds, leveraging both the institutional sales force as 
well as the MSSB 
platform and $7 billion of net inflows into liquidity funds.
 
With respect to our exposures in the European periphery in France, we have 
provided updated and expanded disclosure in our earnings supplement. 
Specifically, we added a column fo
r unfunded commitments, which are now 
included as a component of our exposure before hedges and our net 
exposure. Previously, we disclosed unfunded commitments in a footnote.
 
For the most part, the unfunded commitments and the exposures excluding 
the unfun
ded commitments are consistent with the prior quarter. The 
notable change is with respect to Italy. In December, we began to 
restructure certain derivative positions and amendments to those positions 
settled in January. As a result, our Italian exposure wa
s higher at year end 
relative to the third quarter. However, as we highlight in the footnote to our 
exposure schedule, upon settlement in early January, the exposures declined 
materially. Thus, the data in the footnote most accurately reflect our 
positions
 
post settlement. Following settlement of the restructuring and 
excluding the unfunded commitments, our comparable exposure to last 
quarter for the periphery are $4.3 billion before hedges and $2.3 billion net 
of hedges. For France, our comparable exposure
 
the last quarter are $1.7 
billion before hedges and less than $100 million net of hedges.
 
In conclusion, I will end where James started. We are focused on that which 
we can control. The markets continue to be affected by ongoing uncertainty 
in the Eurozon
e. However, the strategic steps that we took in 2010 and 2011 
cleared out legacy positions and enabled us to focus our attention on 
building on the momentum we have across our businesses. Notably, these 
strategic steps have both a P&L benefit as well as a 
balance sheet benefit, 
reducing our funding needs. Our banking pipeline is healthy globally. Our 
equity business continues to distinguish itself. Our Fixed Income business is 
on its way to reestablishing itself as a market leader in the areas we have 
targe
ted, where we continue to focus on capital efficiency and balance sheet 
velocity. Our Wealth and Asset Management businesses begin 2012 well 
positioned to leverage 2011 flows, the highest in some time for both 
businesses. The steps we took also fortified o
ur capital ratios, beginning in 
the first half of the year with the MUFG equity conversion and ending the 
year with the MBIA settlement, providing additional capacity to deliver for 
our clients.
 
Our strategic moves have resulted in diversification of our f
unding sources, 
allowing us significant degrees of freedom. Because of our increased funding 
diversification, our plain vanilla debt issuance should be meaningfully lower 
than last year as we benefit from efficiencies available from additional 
channels, su
ch as we have $66 billion of wholly owned deposits across the 
firm, a benefit of our MSSB joint venture. Deposits are an attractive source 
of funding, not only for our loan book but increasingly for certain derivatives, 
which we are moving into the bank co
nsistent with new regulations, 
including Dodd
-
Frank.
 
Our relationship with MUFG opened a new funding channel for the firm. We 
issued Uridashi bonds through our joint venture in Japan in the last 2 
quarters. With our ongoing shift to more liquid flow busine
sses, we reduced 
the number of assets that require unsecured debt funding or what we refer 
to as cash funding per our asset liability management governance. And we 
have incremental flexibility in our liquidity pool because our rolling 12
-
month 
maturities w
ill be $10 billion lower at the end of the first quarter versus the 
peak in September of 2011, thus lowering our funding needs by a portion of 
that amount.
 
Now in 2012, with legacy problems behind us, we are relentlessly focused on 
maximizing the return le
vers of our franchise. We have momentum in our 
businesses. We have and will continue to show discipline with lower 
noncomp expenses and have our peak compensation deferrals behind us.

James, your comments on capital management seemed more definitive on 
proceeding with the first phase of the buy
-
in, where previously it seemed 
you were a bit more open to kind of buying back the sto
ck. Am I reading 
that correctly? And if so, what's driving that change in thinking?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Well, I think, listen, the first tranche is only 14%. It is a core plank in our 
overall corporate strategy, which we've made very clear. We're very happy 
wi
th the business. I know the margins aren't where we'd all hope they'd be 
at this point. But the stability of the revenues, the stability of the asset flows 
and the stability of the managed money gives us great confidence in the 
business. And frankly, we're
 
getting close to the end of the integration 
period. So in a tradeoff between sort of financial management being a short
-
term decision around buybacks versus a long
-
term strategic management 
bides [ph] us on the long
-
term strategic management, which is the
 
first 
tranche of the purchase. Now all of that said, it's subject to price and it's 
subject to an appropriate price at fair market value. So if we felt that we 
couldn't come to appropriate terms, we wouldn't move ahead with it. We 
have no problem with tha
t.
 
Howard Chen

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Great. And what about both? Would it be a disappointing outcome if you had 
to choose between either doing the first phase or repurchasing the stock this 
year?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Listen, from my perspective,
 
you'd take these things sequentially. I think 
that you have plenty of opportunities to move forward with buying back 
stock, raising dividends or buying the remainder of Smith Barney. And what 
we have tried to do, as a firm over the last couple of years, i
s be very steady 
and methodical and take one step at a time.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Great. And then in equities, you both highlighted the share gains within the 
business over the recent year quarters. But could you just elaborate
 
on what 
businesses and/or regions have been the primary contributors and how 
sustainable you believe those share gains to be?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we've had actually strength globally and across the products, as I noted, 
and are pleased with the strength of the 
global team. I think that as we've 
gone through the year, you've heard it on both the banking side and the 
sales and trading side, given the ongoing overhang of issues in the 
Eurozone, that's been a more challenging market, but real breadth across 
--
 
aroun
d the globe.
 
Howard Chen

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
And then Ruth, quick one on the numbers on that $600 million crystallized 
CVA gain this quarter. Can you help quantify what losses to date were on 
those exposures prior to this quarter's gain?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I don't have that. But that is, as you characterized, it's a reversal of prior 
losses that have bled through the P&L.
 
Howard Chen

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay, finally. And then I know it's early in the year, but could you just giv
e a 
flavor for how businesses is progressing? One of your peers mentioned 
yesterday, business was about the same as the beginning of last year, and 
wanted to get your thoughts on that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, with the caveat that it is 
--
 
2 weeks is not a quarter
, I would say that 
we ended the year feeling better about the state of the markets. There's a 
lot of cash on the sideline from clients. Our banking pipeline is very healthy. 
The equity new issue pipeline, in particular, has been on hold for quite some 
time
, given the volatility in the market last year. The M&A pipeline is 
healthy. So with that very large caveat that 2 weeks is not a quarter, it's 
feeling a bit better. But I come back to that point, there's still uncertainty in 
the Eurozone, there's still is
sues in the macro environment. We're feeling 
better, but it's still early.
 
James P. Gorman
 
And I would just add to that on the broader economic front, that our view 
has been that the U.S. is a little better off than has generally been 
perceived, and that E
urope is more likely than not to resolve itself, although 
over a period of a couple of years, not a couple of weeks, which was our sort 
of collective attention span in the fall. So against that macro outlook, it is 
--
 
we are as Ruth said.

Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
If you could elaborate a little bit more on MUFG. You commented on the 
funding. What's your intention in highlighting that so much at the top of 
today
's call? Is it that they are there 
--
 
someone with deep pockets if you 
needed some extra help? Or am I just missing the point?
 
James P. Gorman
 
No, listen. How many times in the history of financial services have you seen 
a cross
-
border equity 
investment from one bank to another of this kind and 
the merger of different parts of their businesses, which we do with our 
securities business in Japan? And so number one, there is a strategic story 
here. Number two, the conversion obviously improved our
 
capital and 
reduced a mandatory dividend that we were paying. And I just felt 
--
 
and 
maybe I'm the only one who felt this, but I felt that the world at large did 
not appreciate both the strategic and financial value of this transaction. And 
they are the s
econd largest depository institution in the world. I think they 
have 70% more deposits than any U.S. institution. I may be incorrect on 
that, but I think I'm roughly correct. And I think because they're in Japan, 
they're just not just as well understood if
 
frankly they're in our backyard. 
They're great partners and they have worked hard with us over the last 
several months to find ways to do business together. And I think that's a 
strategic imperative for us, to keep growing with them as partners in finding
 
ways to do business around the world. And I just felt it was important to get 
that message out there.

Right. And then one separate question. When you think about rightsizing the 
firm, the company
 
has hired many employees in the past few years. And 
now you need to reduce employees, it's always very difficult in markets like 
this, but can you talk about the tradeoff between rightsizing for the current 
cycle and investing for the long
-
term?
 
Ruth Pora
t
 
So we were focused on 
--
 
have been focused on the pacing of the recovery. 
It continues to be slow. We, therefore, felt it was appropriate to reduce 
headcount. But that reduction is very consistent with what we've been 
describing strategically and it's qu
ite targeted. So we've been judicious in 
investment areas, particularly within sales and trading. So for example, in 
rates, which has obviously been a focal area, and as I noted, up again this 
quarter, up year
-
over
-
year. We've continued to make key hires i
n research 
and trading to protect and support those growth areas. We've also been 
making, taking steps deemphasizing and reducing balance sheet and risk in 
areas that are inefficient under Basel III. So for example, within our sub
-
investment grade securiti
zation through 2011, we were reducing risk, which 
not only freed up capital and liquidity but enabled us to make some 
headcount reductions. But we have a strong team there that's been 
proactive and repositioning the business. And now they are focused on th
ose 
portions within securitization, the higher
-
quality credit quality tranches that 
actually are quite consistent with the new Basel III regime. So what we've 
tried to do is really strike that right balance between reducing headcount 
where we were could, w
hile making sure we're well positioned for the 
recovery, which as James said, hopefully comes sooner rather than later.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.
 
Guy Moszkowski

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
I 
wanted to ask you if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the 
headwinds that you had in 2011 from sort of multiple years of deferred 
comp. And if you can just give us a little bit more granularity on how that 
rolls off after 2011, in 2012 and beyond
.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in Institutional Securities, we did take comp down meaningfully per 
person this year. And as we said in the fourth quarter of last year call, we 
increased the deferral rate to 60% for 2011 versus 40% previously and 
made a number of other ch
anges. This resulted in a higher comp expense in 
2011, notwithstanding the decrease in comp per person, because 2011 was 
a transition year with an unusual aggregation of deferrals coming into 2011. 
But as James said, when we look at that deferral schedule 
going out from 
here and going most important into 2012, prior year deferrals normalize, 
and in fact, decline in 2012, and we do have more flexibility. So it's really 
about 2011 being that transition year.
 
Guy Moszkowski

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Divis
ion
 
Right. Is there any more sort of quantification that you can provide us as we 
try to accurately reflect this in our model?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, we're not doing that.
 
Guy Moszkowski

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Okay, fair enough. Wanted to ask abou
t the Global Wealth Management and 
the divergence in the fourth quarter of the revenue versus the expense 
trend. I think you did cover it a little bit. But it was a pretty meaningful 
divergence, not for the full year but certainly for the fourth quarter. A
nd yet 
I would hope that by now we would be starting to be able to see some of the 
benefit of the efficiency movements that you've made and being able to take 
advantage of the single platform.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Fair point. I mean, fundamentally we had consistent 
revenues, which 
underscored the stability of the business. But as James said, the margin 
wasn't quite where we want it. And there were a couple of factors affecting 
that. As we said on the third quarter call, revenues are meaningfully affected 
by the S&P c
lose at the end of the year. You know that better than anyone. 
And the 9/30 S&P close was pretty depressed. That is used as the basis for 
setting Asset Management fees for the quarter. I think the good news, as 
we're sitting here today, is the S&P close at
 
the end of the fourth quarter as 
of 12/31 was 11% higher than it was at the end of the third quarter. But 
that was a headwind for the fourth quarter. The other thing was there was a 
lighter equity issuance calendar. And again, that's market
-
related, and 
h
opefully, we see some more activity coming out of that new equity pipeline, 
which does remain strong. The other factors, though, that were fourth 
quarter
-
specific affecting, in particular, the comp expense. One, we've been 
taking out 
--
 
reducing headcount 
of the lower performers. And so we had 
some severance costs in there. The other is that productivity of financial 
advisors has been increasing. And at higher productivity levels, they're 
entitled to a higher comp. And this year, that was a fourth quarter t
rue
-
up. 
Last year, it was a fourth quarter true
-
down. And then the other factor I 
noted is market appreciation from the deferred compensation program, 
that's those that are invested in funds, generally flows through the revenue 
line and the comp expense li
ne, so it becomes 0 margin revenue. And it was 
really a number of different factors. But you're right, and the focus of the 
team is very much focusing on expense across the board so that we can 
continue to drive the margin higher.

BofA Mer

I have one final question, which is just on the Investment Banking and 
trading opportunities that you might be seeing emerging from the problems 
that some of your European competitors are seeing and their need to shrink 
balanc
e sheets maybe faster than some of the U.S. firms. Are you seeing 
significant revenue opportunity starting to develop there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, we are focused on it across industries, given the strength of our 
banking franchise globally but in particular in 
Europe. So on the financial 
institutions side, the expectation is there will be more opportunities to help 
clients raise capital and restructure balance sheets. But I think the other 
factor to consider is it's not just within the state client base. It's re
ally more 
broadly across industries. As we look at in 2008, European banks took share 
from U.S. banks. And that's obviously when this country was going through 
its capital rates focus and liquidity raise. And given that European banks are 
now going through
 
similar issues, our view is that, that creates an even 
broader set of opportunities beyond just, say, again given the strength of 
our franchise, we do see this as an opportunity to gain share. On the sales 
and trading side, we're well positioned and hope 
to built off of the 
momentum that you've seen in some of the numbers through this year. And 
then on the balance sheet side, I think that, again going back to James' 
comments about the strength of our partnership with MUFG, it just further 
strengthens our a
bility to help clients in Europe as well.
 
James P. Gorman
 
And I think, Guy, as you 
--
 
in any industry restructuring, as the players 
between sort of 10 to 20 range exit, clearly that share is going to flow to 
those at the top. And a lot of our businesses we
re ranked 1, 2 or 3 in the 
key businesses we're in. So I think there's probably a little bit of a short
-
term impact, but I do think there's a longer
-
term change in industry 
structure that should play to our advantage.

The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.

Two quick follow
-
ups on FICC and equities. First, in FICC in general, whether 
or not you want to include the CVA changes. If you back out DVA, CVA, 
MBIA, is the right starting point for the quarter for FICC on a clean
 
basis, 
going forward, $600
-
ish million?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I'll let you judge how you want to look at it.
 
Glenn Schorr

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Excellent. I can read that. In equities, Ruth, your comments were very clear 
that cash and elect
ronic was a better driver in the quarter, and PB and 
derivs sequentially were lower. I mean, something's going really right in 
cash and electronic. And I just don't know if you have any more you can tell 
us. Is it what you and James both just alluded to in
 
Europe? Or is this just 
constant progress and getting a greater share of client wallet? Of course, it's 
a significant outperformance if it's cash and electronic.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It is real outperformance relative to the market volumes that we saw. With 
market 
volumes down, there was strength there. I would say that the 
strength of the team across products continues to be a real driver for the 
performance in the business. And you see it year
-
over
-
year, when you look 
at the sequential improvement, the strength th
at we had in derivatives goes 
back to a lot of the comments we've had on prior calls, which is that the 
team has been focused on really building adjacencies across its business, 
ensuring that we've built up what we did on the derivative side. You go back 
2
 
years ago when we said we were going to build up equity derivatives. We 
had 3 sequential strong quarters there. And so it's really across products 
working together as well as they do and around the globe. So the benefit of 
the electronic platform is there
's still delivery to clients, electronic invoice. 
It's working well, and it's really enabling us to stay as well connected to 
clients as possible.

Sounds like you feel it's sustainable as well. I
 
appreciate that you are the 
only person I cover that actually expanded the European exposure 
disclosure. But what's the net
-
net? Meaning, I don't know if I heard the, ""We 
feel very comfortable, we think their exposures are collateralized."" And 
what's your
 
net
-
net feeling on your Euro exposures?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We do feel 
--
 
I think you've summed it up well. We feel very comfortable 
with our exposures. We think that continuing to provide the transparency is 
helpful. And so we've expanded the disclosure this quar
ter, but we feel very 
comfortable with our exposures. We've got a strong business in Europe, and 
we remain present. But we like the way we've managed over the last several 
years here.
 
James P. Gorman
 
And I would say, Glenn, we were never quite in the camp 
of the hysteria 
that surrounded us last October about our European exposures. We're a little 
bewildered by it, to be honest, which led us to a very fulsome disclosure in 
the appendix last quarter, and it's been netted to with the unfunded 
commitments this 
quarter. And frankly, the position has been improved by 
reducing one of the larger concentrated positions.

And then lastly, is the overhang in Europe and uncertainty there, is that the 
major impe
tus to remove a cloud to get to a higher earnings level? I 
appreciate all the progress made, but I'm sure people are still looking for 
more in '12.
 
Ruth Porat
 
That is the primary overhang. This year 
--
 
the past year, 2011, has the dual 
complexity of all of
 
the drama around the debt crisis and the downgrade for 
the U.S. But as James said, I think there are more signs of progress so far in 
the U.S., and that the ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone continues to be a 
big cloud. There clearly also is some of the
 
question marks around 
regulatory uncertainty. But if you were to rank them, I think the Eurozone 
and therefore, the issues that are holding back some clients from executing 
on transactions is a problem.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Roger Free
man with Barclays Capital.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
I guess, first, just 
--
 
you talked about some of the sort of resizing that 
you've done. And I guess, I'm curious. How much sort of the forward
-
looking 
--
 
and you said, too. Y
ou've kind of identified businesses you want to be in. 
But how confident are you around where the outstanding regulatory 
questions, rules around derivatives, Volcker, are going to land such that, 
that may still be subject to substantial revision going forw
ard? Or do you 
think you kind of have a pretty good sense of positioning at this point?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Well, I think, as we've said for a while, the most important regulatory 
change are the capital requirements coming out of Basel III. And I think we 
have a reasonably good handle on where that is likely to end. The whole 
Volcker, Dodd
-
Frank discussions are obviously still very much ongoing, as 
witnessed by the hearings yesterday. And listen, we've obviously done an 
enormous amount of work internally qu
antifying the impact of different rule 
changes, what they would mean for our business and so on. Our base case 
is not an extreme shutting down of all market
-
making activity. And we think 
that the original concept of Volcker, which was to ensure that deposi
ts were 
not used for highly liquid prop trading, should be honored, and then we'd 
move forward with that. So the regulatory front remains very much in 
dialogue. You've got governments around the world weighing in on the U.S. 
position to make sure that the 
various international bond markets aren't 
disproportionally affected. You've got inventory management by large 
institutions like ours to ensure that we can provide liquidity for our clients. 
So it remains fluid as you know it. But we run all sorts of scena
rios against 
it.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay, that's helpful. Then separately, other sales and trading, I was 
wondering if could give us a little more color on what drove the delta there. 
You mentioned hedge gains on 
owned debt. Did you repurchase some of 
your own debt during the quarter? And if so, how much? And is that an 
ongoing activity?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, you got a couple of questions in there. So the other sales and trading 
line is, as we've talked about in the pas
t, is pretty difficult to model. I 
appreciate because it has a number of items in it, and it has amortizing 
hedges from debt we bought back in '08, '09. It has our long
-
term debt 
hedging program. It has our bank liquidity portfolio, loan book, our deferred
 
compensation plan. And so sometimes the items all move in one direction 
and sometimes they're offsetting, and so therein lies the complexity. We did 
buy back some of our debt over the quarter. It was a small amount, and so 
that really didn't explain it. I
t was really just the various across
-
the
-
board 
items.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay, got it. Then lastly, do you 
--
 
similar to what Goldman talked about 
yesterday on the relationship lending, both the CD backstops [ph], is tha
t a 
big business for you? Are you considering potentially moving to hold the 
maturity? And tied to that, more broadly, are there other issues like this that 
maybe we put in an active mitigation bucket, that when we look forward to 
Basel III, helps you to e
ven grow these ratios higher than what the past roll 
forward [ph] points to?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So with respect to lending an HFI, fundamentally, we are a mark
-
to
-
market 
shop. I think as it relates to the loan book, we obviously have a bank. We're 
the 15th largest
 
U.S. depository by deposits. And so we're always 
considering what make sense in terms of capital and funding efficiency. I 
think notably in CCAR, mark
-
to
-
market loans were penalized substantially 
more than HFI loans. And our view is it's our responsibilit
y to consider what 
makes sense for shareholders. So that is one consideration. And then the 
other question I think you're asking is with respect to what other 
repositioning under Basel III. And I think we have, as I noted, continued to 
focus on 2 things re
ally within Fixed Income. One is share gains, the other is 
return on capital. And part of the return on capital driver is really having a 
forward lens to Basel III requirements and ensuring that we are positioning 
our businesses to be as capital
-
efficient 
under this Basel III regime. And so 
there should be continued benefit from active mitigation as we continue to 
rightsize some of the portions of businesses that are most affected by Basel 
III.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Michael Carrier with 
Deutsche Bank.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Ruth, maybe, one follow
-
up on the expenses. So you guys have kind of the 
efficiency initiative over the next, I think, 2 more years on the $1.4 billion 
side. And then you have some of thi
s restructuring. So I guess, just some 
update on what's going on maybe in the first, second quarter on the cost 
side, given some of the more recent moves versus any change on that 
longer
-
term efficiency project for the $1.4 billion.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So on the of
fice of reengineering, we remain confident with that $1.4 billion, 
that's a target by 2014. And we're also very comfortable with the run rate 
target for this year, which is $500 million. The key focus areas are the same 
as the ones we've discussed previous
ly, the highest ones being location 
strategy, procurement programs and tech spending. And so that's very much 
on track. But I'd underscore the non
-
compensation expense this quarter, 
which as I said, was down relative to last quarter. And that's notable 
bec
ause the fourth quarter is typically our sequential high. And it really 
underscores what we're doing at the tactical level. So if you put kind of the 
office of reengineering in this bucket, a bigger, more strategic, however you 
want to define it, cost
-
cutt
ing that takes longer to do because we're 
repositioning the way we do certain elements of the business, and put that 
to the side. We also have a tactical initiative, and we're pleased with our 
noncomps because it shows that on even across
-
the
-
board small i
tems, 
we've taken a really diligent approach to ensure that we're doing all that we 
can to control costs. And that also persists as we move into this new year.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Okay, that's helpful. And then James, just
 
on the Wealth Management 
business, so 2 things there. Just margins in the fourth quarter tend to be 
low, you guys mentioned, just given the seasonality of expenses and then 
given where markets were. As we head into this year and assuming rates 
don't chang
e, like where do you think margins can get, assuming flat, 
slightly up markets? And then just in terms of the buy
-
in, based on what you 
guys have it marked and where Citi's got it marked, in terms of odds of 
getting that concluded or taking in that 14% sta
ke, like if it's somewhere in 
between, like a middle ground, is that 
--
 
do you see enough value in that 
business to be purchasing it for some level of that's in that range?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Yes. I'll talk about the second question and Ruth can talk about wh
ere we're 
looking at the margins here. On the process, just recall it's a call option 
exercisable, I think, at May 31 or June 1. If the parties can't agree, we go to 
a third party, and it's at fair market value. I don't think there's going to be a 
whole lo
t of mystery, frankly, irrespective of whatever institution has it 
marked at is kind of irrelevant. It's a question of what is fair market value. 
And we're both mature, grown
-
up institutions, so I think we'll quickly figure 
out our fair market value. And i
f we can't, then we'll obviously go to a third 
party. So it's not a traditional M&A
-
type transaction in that the prices are 
already determined which is market value. So I'm not particularly focused on 
that element of it. And as we said earlier, if you look
 
at the strategic 
rationale for this business, it's part of our long
-
term plan, and we obviously 
count the goodwill against that capital already in it. So the incremental cost, 
if you will, of doing this against the benefit is relatively small to say the 
l
east.
 
Ruth, I don't know if we have anything more to add on fourth quarter and 
where we're looking at this year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. And the only other thing to add, this is our call option. So similarly, our 
call option on whether it goes to arbitration. But 
with respect to margins, 
we're continuing to focus on the mid
-
teen margin target, and the levers that 
we've talked about remain very much the ones that Greg and his team 
continue to be focused on. So on the cost side, the lower integration 
expense having c
racked the back on the major expenditures with the 
technology platform done in the third quarter of last year. But also given the 
environment, the team has raised the bar in expense management. And 
then similarly on the revenue side, a real focus on contin
uing growth of the 
managed account platform, as I mentioned, the ongoing growth in lending 
and a couple of other issues. And to be clear, that's not mid 
--
 
That's not 
2012 guidance, that's kind of our mid
-
next year guidance.
 
Operator
 
The next question will
 
come from Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.
 
Fiona Swaffield 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
I just had a question on the risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I. I think you 
said $316 billion. Could you take us through kind of some quant
ification of 
the moving parts? And then I also think that you mentioned sub
-
investment
-
grade securitizations, having done some work on reducing. Would that then 
mean that the Basel III 
--
 
is that part of the $100 billion rolloffs? Or does 
that mean that th
e $480 billion, which I think will obviously has gone down 
post the MBIA, to maybe $430 billion, if you could confirm that? Does that 
mean that, that number could be coming down a bit? I wonder if you could 
help us on that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So on Basel I, why th
e risk
-
weighted asset is lower there? They're lower in 
part as I noted because of MBIA and also the balance sheet's lower. And so 
our risk
-
weighted assets came down in line with where the balance sheet is. 
With respect to Basel III, what we're really focus
ed on, given there have 
been a number of changes affecting 
--
 
in guidance affecting both numerator 
and denominator over the last 1.5 years, when we initially gave out 
guidance on RWA inflation and mitigation. And Basel 2.5 has moved from an 
NPR to 2.5, is 
kind of moving around. So as a result, what we thought is the 
most effective and useful is to give you where we are in Tier 1 common 
ratio. And our Tier 1 common under Basel III, we're comfortable that it's 
approaching 10% by year
-
end 2012. In the numerato
r, we are deducting the 
MSSB NCI and adding consensus earnings. And in denominator, you have 
RWA inflation and passive mitigation from here through the end of 2012. 
We'll continue to be focused on active mitigation, to your question. And so 
that remains in
cremental upside of any active mitigation, but focused on the 
overall ratio here.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Daniel Harris with Goldman Sachs.
 
Daniel F. Harris 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
I was wondering if we can 
continue to focus on Global Wealth here for a 
second. So you mentioned that by the middle part of the year, the 
integration should be largely complete on the technology side. What 
happens then at that point with regards to the number of offices you have? 
A
nd how do we think about that, assuming all else equal, with regards to 
your ability to take out non
-
compensation?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The offices 
--
 
we are continuing to look at where there are efficiencies in 
combining offices. Sometimes there are, sometimes ther
e aren't because 
you have fully staffed active offices potentially within a similar area. So you 
can assume that across the board, we're continuing to look at where it 
makes sense to further consolidate or take or cut costs. And the team is 
being quite det
ailed about that. With respect to the technology spend and 
integration
-
related cost, the integration expense does come down. There is 
some software capitalization that then comes in, so you can't assume it's a 
cliff that drops off to 0. But it's come down 
meaningfully, and that's the real 
point there. And so we've hit the high point and it's rolling off. There are 
ongoing expenses that hit the P&L, and then the other expenses that the 
team can focus on include everything that you can imagine, all the detail
s 
within the P&L, to do whatever we can to drive margin.
 
Daniel F. Harris 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
And so the integration costs this quarter were roughly $70 million or so and 
you expect that, that should trend down a little but not ge
t to 0?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The point is the integration expense comes down to 0. But I just wanted to 
make it clear that from a margin impact that there are offsets to that, 
namely I think, the one most relevant is software capitalization. And there's 
some other i
tems that continue to flow through the P&L once we're steady
-
state.
 
Daniel F. Harris 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. And then lastly on for me 
--
 
so thanks for the color earlier on into the 
very early 2 weeks of the year here. Obviously
, a lot of us track activity 
levels, and they certainly seem weaker. But I wanted to focus in on one area 
that's more difficult, and that's credit. I think that, that's the one area where 
we look at that we can actually see some good results, if you're thi
nking 
about credit tightening and structured credit trading. Is that an area that's 
been something that's been better than we saw in the fourth quarter, which 
was down 
--
 
better in the first quarter that was down last year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, again, it's ver
y early, too early to say. I think that the marks that we 
--
 
the pain in credit in the third quarter was acute. And as I noted, it was 
modestly 
--
 
it was better this quarter but still not running at levels that are 
consistent with historic levels for that 
business. We have a very strong credit 
business broadly. And so there is upside as credit markets continue to heal. 
But I would say that, given that the major overhang, as both James and I 
said, is the Eurozone crisis and/or uncertainty in the Eurozone, it
's too early 
to make a call on that.

Good morning. Thank you, Celeste. As we begin another year, I wanted to 
update you on our thoughts on the 

headed as well as provide you with a list against which you can mark us to 
market through 2014.
 

deeper into some of the strategic areas in wh

those that would drive the greatest earnings in ROE upside for the firm. 
There are slides available on the website and then Ruth will take you 
through the quarterly review and together we will take questions at the end.

13 was year of playing offense for Morgan Stanley. Outside of some of the 
legacy legal issues from the crisis period, our focus was moving the firm and 
our strategy forward and advancing down the path to meeting and beating 
our cost of equity. We achieved 
to advance a number of strategic objectives 
including the six to five in January of last year; specifically we acquired a 
100% of the Wealth Management joint venture.
 
We achieved our Wealth Management margin goal through expense 
management and exceeded the
m through revenue growth. We made 
significant progress toward our RWA reduction goals of Fixed Income and 
Commodities and exceeded 2013 and our 2014 targets.
 
We are on track to meet our expense targets to 2014 excluding litigation. 
We are also on track to 
meet our long
-
term goals to growing earnings 

made progress towards returns to meet and exceed the cost of capital, 
excluding litigation and we began our first buyback since 2008 in the
 
middle 
of last year.
 
Like all of our peers we have litigation exposure which is laid out in 
extensive detail in our filings. In addition to the higher legal expenses we 
incurred in the first three quarters of 2013, we took a charge of $1.2 billion 
in the 
fourth quarter. Obviously we cannot predict the future. But we believe 
this move represent significant progress towards putting these matters 
behind us.
 
The steps we will outline for you today are a continuation of what we 
discussed a year
-
ago and consiste
nt with the strategy that this management 
team put in place four years ago. We had six strategic focus areas and again 
you can follow along with the slides on our website.
 
We will achieve our goals in a prudent manner without taking outside risks 
and takin
g consideration the need of all of our stakeholders. Number one, 
continue to drive Wealth Management through margin goals and higher cost 
--
 
improved cost initiatives from revenue growth.
 
In mid 2013 we increased our margin targets to 20% to 22% by the end
 
of 
2015, driven by the upside from earning a 100% of the Wealth Management 
business. We reach the bottom of that range in the fourth quarter excluding 
the impairment driven by partial connection of the benefits of only a 100% 
as well as higher markets. Ba
sed on where the S&P closed 2013 and our 
expectation for deposit deployment, we are now raising our target for year
-
end 2015 to 22% to 25% even without the benefit of higher rates.
 
Second, Fixed Income and Commodities. We have a threefold plan to drive 
our
 
returns to greater than our cost of equity in Fixed Income and 
Commodities. Number one; optimize the Commodities business by reducing 
our exposure of physical commodities. Number two, improve the efficiency 
in ROE of our other Fixed Income businesses thro
ugh centralized or 
federalized management of resources. And number three continue to reduce 
risk weighted assets.
 
In regards to Commodities, we announced late last year that we are selling 
our global physical oil business. This will be done in two parts. T
he first is 
the transaction we announced for the Rosneft, which included the sale of our 
oil merchanting business. The second component is our intention to expose 
strategic options for our stake in TransMontaigne, which is a separate 
discrete entity that p
rovides a wide variety of distribution and storage 
services for oil related products in North America. We believe we can 
generate an acceptable ROE with the remaining Commodities business, 
which is also more consistent with our client base across sales and
 
trading.
 
Outside of Commodities we have philosophically changed the way we run 
Fixed Income from a highly segregated to a highly federalized model with a 
more strategic approach to resource allocation division wide and a particular 
focus on expenses, tech
nology, capital and balance sheet. We have achieved 
normalized ROEs around or above that cost of capital in almost all product 
areas, except for rates. We are aligning our approach in rates to be more 
consistent with that of the rest of Fixed Income with t
he leadership team 
that has a heightened focus on balance sheet utilization and high velocity.
 
Finally, we have moved forward our Fixed Income and Commodities, RWA 
target by one year. Previously our target was to reach the 180 billion RWA 
level by the end 
of 2016. Now we expect to reach that level by the end of 
2015.
 
Third area was expenses. Let me update you on where we are versus the 
targets we set out a year
-
ago. We said that assuming flat revenue our 
expenses will be down $1.6 billion by the end of 2014
, which implied an 

on track to meet or beat the 79% expense ratio implied by the $1.6 billion 
target, assuming revenues in 2014 are higher or in line with 2013 and 
excluding litigatio
n above 2012 levels. Because we expect revenue to 
continue to grow in 2014 and beyond, we will focus our discussion in the 
future on these ratios.
 
Our target expense ratio for 2014 and beyond is less than 79%, assuming 
flat or higher revenues and excluding
 
legal expenses again above the 2012 
levels. Marking the market 2013 our expenses were up for several reasons. 
First, we had expenses that are not likely to recur in 2014 including several 
write
-
offs in Wealth Management. Second, we along with the industry
 
experienced elevated legal expenses. Adjusting for those two factors, our 
expense base in 2013 would have been $26.1 billion reflecting a 79% 
expense ratio.
 
Additionally, revenue grew 9% during the year and we thus experienced 
growth in activity relating 
expenses to those revenues including 
compensation, brokerage and clearing. Excluding activity
-
based expenses, 
our fully adjusted expense base in 2013 would have been $24.5 billion, more 
than half way through the reductions we discussed with you a year
-
ago.
 
Let me now turn to the fourth topic, which is Morgan Stanley specific growth 
opportunities and most notably in the bank. We spend a great deal of time in 
the last year introducing you to the upside associated with the bank. And in 
the deck you have on sli

 
Revenue growth in our bank will be driven by three tailwinds, including 
growth in the deposit base and associated assets, the optimization of these 
assets, moving cash into AFS and lending and finally upside f
rom higher 
rates. The significant revenue growth will flow through Wealth Management 
and Institutional Services with exceptionally high incremental margins well 
above the margins we are generating today as we have already made the 
infrastructure investment
.
 
By the end of 2015, we expect to have an asset base of approximately $160 
billion. Based on current market rates and our expected asset mix at the end 
of 2015, the blended yield would be 1.8%. If we substitute the yields 
indicated by the forward curve on
 
the same asset base, the average yield 
would then be 2.7%.
 
The fifth topic is of course the return of capital to shareholders. We intend to 
prudently increase our return of capital to shareholders over time subject to 
of course the regulatory approval, in
creasing both our share buyback 
program and our dividends reflecting greater percent of our revenue and 
earnings coming from more stable businesses. The key driver of increased 
return to shareholders over time are our increasingly consistent earnings, 
our 
strong capital ratios and finally our strategy that is consistent with the 
evolving regulatory requirements.
 
Finally, the sixth point which is of course our ROE returns. Our focus is to 
drive higher returns to shareholders through sustainably improving our
 
ROE 
to levels equal to or in excess of our cost of equity even without a cyclical 
recovery. Assuming no improvement in the institution and retail market, 
normalized litigation expenses, execution of our bank strategy and expense 
initiatives, a strategic s
olution for physical commodities and centralized 
Fixed Income as well as Wealth Management margin improvement, we 
believe we can reach ROEs above 9% and ROTs of 10%. Then assuming 
excess capital will get us to or above 10% levels on ROE and 11% on ROT. 
Of 
course an improved operating environment would drive those numbers 
further.
 
I will now turn it over to Ruth, to walk you through the fourth quarter 
results. Thank you.

of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the foot notes to the earnings 
release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in the 
quarter was negative $368 million with $285 million in Fixed Income, sales 
and trading and $83 million in equ
ity sales and trading. Excluding the impact 
of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues were $8.2 billion, up 1% versus the third 
quarter.
 
Earnings and earnings per share included $1.2 billion or $0.40 per share of 
legal expenses. The effective tax rate from containing ope
rations for the 
fourth quarter reflects an overall benefit of $328 million including a discrete 
benefit of $192 million. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to 
Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were approximately 
$384 million.
 
Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA were 
$0.20 after preferred dividends.
 
On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues for the 
quarter were 7.8 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to 
M
organ Stanley common shareholders were 144 million. GAAP results also 
included 1.2 billion or $0.40 per share of legal expenses. Reported earnings 
from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.07 after preferred 
dividends. Book value at the end of t
he quarter was $32.29 per share and 
tangible book value was $27.21 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were 832 billion at December 
31. Deposits as of quarter end were 112 billion, up 8 billion versus 3Q. Our 
liquidity reserve at the 
end of the quarter was 202 billion compared with 198 
billion at the end of the third quarter.
 
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that 
our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 12.8% and our 
Tier 1 capi
tal ratio will be approximately 15.7%.
 
Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately 389 
billion at December 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal 
Reserve rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 10
.5% 
at December 31. Pro forma risk
-
weighted assets under Basel III are 
estimated to be 428 billion.
 
Our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was negatively affected 
by approximately 50 basis points due to an increase in our operational risk 
RWAs, 
which resulted from higher legal costs in the quarter. This was 
partially offset by earnings accretion and the ongoing reduction in Fixed 
Income RWAs.
 
We expect our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio to be approximately 
4.2%. This estimate reflects the
 
United States proposed regulatory rules for 
the numerator and the denominator and is subject to change is rules evolve. 
We continue to expect to exceed the required 5% level in 2015 including an 
assumption for increasing returns of capital to shareholders
.
 
On Slide 14 of our strategy deck, we have outlined the drivers of our path to 
an SLR of greater than 5% in 2015. Forces within our control include 
exposure compression and RWA reductions, earnings accretion and other 
numerator drivers including DTA reduc
tions, increased investment capacity, 
preferred issuance and other reduced numerator deductions, which in 
aggregate could drive approximately 180 basis points to 210 basis points of 
improvement in our ratio. Potential offsets include balance sheet growth a
nd 
capital returns.
 
Turning to expenses, total expenses this quarter were 7.9 billion, up 20% 
versus the third quarter but up 1% excluding the legal item I noted. 
Compensation expense was essentially flat to the prior quarter. Non
-
compensation expense was 
3.9 billion reflecting higher legal costs.
 
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In institutional securities, 
revenues excluding DVA were 3.7 billion, down 4% sequentially. Non
-
interest expense was 4.4 billion, up 34% versus the third quarter. 
Compe
nsation was 1.6 billion for the fourth quarter, down 4% versus the 
third quarter, reflecting a 42% ratio excluding DVA.
 
Non
-
compensation expense of 2.9 billion reflects the elevated legal expenses 
due to settlements and additions to reserves related to leg
acy, residential, 
mortgage
-
backed securities matters associated with the credit crisis. The 
business reported a pre
-
tax loss of 745 million excluding the impact of DVA. 
Including the impact of DVA to pre
-
tax loss was 1.1 billion.
 
In investment banking, rev
enues of 1.4 billion were up 37% versus last 
quarter. Results were driven by increased revenues in all products; equity 
underwriting, advisory and Fixed Income underwriting. According to 
Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #3 in global announced and 
com
pleted M&A, global IPOs and global equity at the end of the fourth 
quarter.
 
Notable transactions included in advisory, Morgan Stanley is a leader in 
cross
-
border activity with transactions including Portugal Telecom's 15.7 
billion merger with Oi SA which r
epresented the largest M&A announced deal 
for the quarter as well as Perrigo's 8.6 billion acquisition of Elan.
 
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as the advisor to Crown Castle 
International as lead left book runner and stabilization agent on co
mmon 
and mandatory offering while also acting as lead left book runner on the 3.4 
billion senior unsecured committed bridge facility.
 
In debt underwriting, event related financings included Morgan Stanley 
acting as lead left book runner on Devon Energy's 2
.3 billion debt offering in 
support of the company's acquisition of GeoSouthern Energy's Eagle Ford 
assets.
 
Advisory revenues of 451 million were up 64% versus our third quarter 
results, driven by increased revenues across regions. Equity underwriting 
reve
nues of 416 million were up 76% versus the third quarter, also driven 
by increases across regions, in particular in Europe as well as a significant 
increase in IPO volumes.
 
Fixed Income underwriting revenues were 495 million, up 3% versus the 
third quarter
 
driven by loan syndication fees partially offset by decreases in 
investment grade underwriting.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were 1.5 billion, a 
decrease of 12% from last quarter. Results were strong for our fourth 
quarter with robust
 
client activity across regions and products. Cash equity 
revenues increased driven by higher volumes in most major markets. 
Derivatives, revenues remained healthy although declined from a strong 3Q 
'13.
 
Prime brokerage revenues and balances were up in 4Q 
and were the highest 
since 2008. Fixed Income and Commodity sales and trading revenues 
excluding DVA were 694 million. Commodities revenues were meaningfully 
lower in a difficult market. Revenues outside of Commodities were up 
slightly sequentially, despit
e a larger sequential drag from CVA.
 
Revenues were driven by increases in credit, foreign exchange and 
securitized products partially offset by lower results and rates. Client 
volumes held up relatively well across businesses in the fourth quarter 
though r
emained subdued in line with the industry.
 
Investment revenues of 177 million were down versus the third quarter 
which included the sale of the insurance broker hub. Average trading bar for 
the fourth quarter was 51 million, essentially flat to the third q
uarter.
 
Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were 3.7 billion in the fourth 
quarter. Asset management revenues of 2 billion were up versus last 
quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher market levels at the beginning of the 
quarter and positive flows.
 
Tr
ansaction revenues increased 10% from last quarter consisting primarily of 
commissions of 576 million, which were up 14% versus the prior quarter, 
due to a pick up across products. Investment banking related fees of 206 
million, up 11% versus the last quar
ter, reflecting an increase in equity 
underwriting activity, and trading revenues of 323 million, up 2% versus the 
third quarter reflecting higher deferred compensation plans.
 
Net interest revenue increased 7% to 528 million, driven primarily by higher 
rev
enues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our 
lending product. Other revenue increased to 110 million from 75 million. 
Non
-
interest expense was 3 billion, up versus last quarter. The 
compensation ratio is 58%, flat versus the third quarte
r, non
-
compensation 
expense was 876 million, up 10% versus last quarter, due to an impairment 
charge as well as the typical seasonal increase in expenses.
 
The PVT margin was 19% and was 20% excluding the impairment charge. 
Profit before tax was 709 million
. Total client assets were up versus the third 
quarter to 1.9 trillion. Global fee
-
based asset inflows were 12 billion. Fee
-
based assets under management increased to 697 billion at quarter end, 
representing 37% of AUM.
 
Global representative were 16,456, e
ssentially flat to the third quarter. Bank 
deposits were 134 billion, up versus the third quarter, approximately 104 
billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.
 
Investment management, revenues of 842 million were up 2% from the 
third quarter. In traditional
 
asset management, revenues of 430 million were 
up 17% from the third quarter, driven by higher market levels. In real estate 
investing, revenues of $160 million were down 31% driven by a decline in 
carry as last quarter we had a significant benefit from c
arry catch up. 
Merchant banking revenues were $252 million up 12% reflecting increased 
deferred compensation plans as well as higher investment gains from an IPL 
of an existing private equity investment. Expenses were $505 million down 
4% from the third qu
arter. Profit before tax was $337 million up 12% 
sequentially. NCI was $46 million versus $64 million last quarter. Total 
assets under management increased to $373 billion driven by market 
depreciation.
 
As to our outlook, in investment banking the momentum
 
evident in the 
fourth quarter persists as we enter 2014. In particular the M&A pipeline 
continues to build on the back of improving global economies. The drivers 
evident in 2013 remain in the cross border transaction, financial sponsors 
and activists. We 
expect further upside from one to pick up in corporate 
existing from sponsor, buyers as well as to the uptick in activity in EMEA 
after very muted levels for the last several years. The outlook for equity 
underwriting in 2014 remains healthy especially rel
ative to the low volumes 
in EMEA and Asia experienced in 2013. Trading volumes and client activity 
across sales and trading are beginning to reflect confidence in global growth.
 
In Wealth Management our outlook for 2014 is similarly constructive given 
higher markets, lending growth and ongoing improvements in retail investor 
engagement. Our revised PBT margin targets helped to quantify the upside 
we see in this business. Finally w
e would expect return on equity to further 
benefit from an increasing capital returns upon completion of the CCAR 
process at the end of Q1.
 
Thank you for listening and James and I will now take your questions.

Operator
 
(Operator
 
Instructions) The first question will come from Glenn Schorr with 
ISI.
 
Glenn Schorr

ISI
 
Thank you. Within your plans for Fixed Income I was wondering if you could 

opposed to a revenue
 

 
Ruth Porat
 
So the focus is an ROE focus as opposed to a revenue focus. And as we 
indicated we have a number of areas that are driving the overall ROE higher. 

re 
taking in Commodities. We are selling two physical oil businesses there, the 


business is essentially bre
akeven and it has about $4 billion risk weighted 
assets, so accretive to returns there. With respect to the second business 

With respect to moving to centralize 
--
 
the move to centraliz
ed management 
we have a very systematic and clinical approach really to optimizing returns 


in other bu
sinesses across the platform.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Rates right now is still the biggest revenue piece of FICC I take it?
 
Ruth Porat
 


venues, optimizing 

FICC across products to levels on a normalized basis that are at or above 
cost to capital. We in fact made significant improvement in foreign exchange 
this year
, this past year and are at this point operating with returns basically 

basis, so the next one to add here with the same approach is rates.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Okay, cool. Speaking of R
WA, hopefully I did the math right and I think 
Basel III RWA was up 3.5% almost quarter
-
on
-

because I know the overall focus is down in Fixed Income and down overall. 
Was there anything particular that drove that this quarter be
cause I know 
the direction is going the other way?
 
Ruth Porat
 


calculation is ops risk that captures litigation
. And so with the higher reserve 
here in the fourth quarter that would change the overall calculation of the 

 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
A question on that Ruth is, if that happen in the quarter that you realiz
ed 
higher legal costs or is that a permanent addition that kind of sticks through 
the process until further notice?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the way it works is, with the addition of a sizable data point within the 
overall distribution of data points you have to calc
ulate ops risk. Once you 
add a more sizable data point as we did here, data in the tail would affect 
the overall calculation. Smaller pieces kind of in the belly of the distribution 

dataset it remains in the dataset until you see a change in the distribution, 
so it is in there for some time.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Got you. I guess I mean if James is right on his comment of putting most of 
the stuff to bed, and maybe within a years time yo
u start to get the benefit 
of that I know the CCAR process moves slow. Last one, Wealth Management 
loans and commitments were up another 10% this quarter or up almost 
50% year
-
on
-
year, I guess there is the PLA component and all the securities 
based stuff a

us which one of those is growing and of the overall pie how important is it to 
Wealth Management in general because I know it comes on a different comp 
grid.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So overall loan growth is
 
important to Morgan Stanley across businesses; 

well as Wealth Management and in fact on the ROE walk it's the most 
important incremental driver to returns. But to your quarter with 
respect to 

deposits that are asset optimization and then what that translates into. 
Growth is across both PLA or the securities based lending product and 

of it in PLA, although I would say in the 

deliberately constraining production there because we were both focused on 
client experience and in fact applications were up in the quarter.
 
But the

penetrated 
relative to our peers, this is very logical consistent product for them.

The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous

Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Guy Moszkowski

Just a quick 
question on the SLR first of all; did you have a chance to think 
about what the impact of the final BIS add
-
ons that were announced last 
weekend would be?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We have been working through that, it's a complex calculation in particular 
with respect t
o the net long CDS sold portion of it is as you know well. Our 
preliminary calculation is we are approaching 4% on that basis well above 
the 3% required.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 

t the SLR on 
the NPR basis up to the 5%. Can you talk a little bit about what the 


side?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well the 

assumption about increasing returns of capital as I just break them down 
into the numerator and denominator. In the numerator not only do we 
benefit from earnings accretion, but there is a multi
plier effect because of 
certain deductions most notably DTA and the investment capacity deduction. 
The investment capacity is based on the size of Tier 1 capital so certainly as 
Tier 1 capital increases you have a larger basket smaller deduction of 
holding
 
capital against certain items that fall into that basket amount like 
our joint venture in MUMSS at each end of the bucket. So when the bucket 
gets bigger there are fewer deductions. And then there are specific steps 
that we can take to focus, and that we 
are taking to focus on items that are 
captured in the investment bucket. So I would think of it, its earnings 
accretions and a multiplier impact on that for the reasons that I just 
described. And when it's being efficient with some of those numerator 
deduc

--
 

obviously also adds to the numerator. You can do 

 
so the dividends, you 
could say, would be the deduct, but it adds to the overall
 
Tier 1 capital and 
as well to therefore the investme
nt bucket. In the denominator, we continue 
to have a benefit from the RWA rundown and as we've talked about, that's 
in areas that are not accretive to revenue. And I'd say the other one that is 
important is compression. And I would put that in the bucket o
f just good 
hygiene. So we've invested quite a bit in central clearing, back loading into 
central clearing. It gives us great opportunity for compression. We're seeing 
more interest in that from banks on both sides of the Atlantic, and again 
that's just in
 
the category of good hygiene. So I think that we're very 
comfortable with the implications of this, the various levers we have to move 
up to the greater than 5%.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 

he strategic changes 
that you might be making in rates? For example, maybe changing the way 
you look at repo or anything like that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. And the assumption on 

 
that's embedded in this slide is consensus 
earnings, but I'd say that the other items
 
that I enumerated are quite very 
important and no, there isn't enough change in the assumption on some of 
the other items.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Got it. Is there a new sort of breakeven level of thick revenues that you 
need to achieve to ge
t to that ROE equal to your cost of equity, and when I 
say breakeven I mean specifically, a level of revenue that you would be 
given your cost base in order to get the whole FICC business to earning at 
cost of equity? I think in the past you've talked abou
t 6 billion or so and I 
just wondered if its lower?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So let me answer that by pointing you back, for example, to Commodities. 
We've talked about the thing we are clinically focused on is driving returns 
higher in that business. And to your questi
on you focused on one of the 
three levers, it's revenues, it's expenses and it's capital optimization. So as I 
indicated, with the business that is being sold throughout and after this 
point, it is essentially PVT breakeven from Morgan Stanley. It has abou
t 4 
billion of risk
-
weighted assets in it, so yes, there may be a diminution in 
revenues there but when you look at the cost structure running that type of 
business within BHC, it's more valuable in the hands of an investor or player. 
We have higher capita
l liquidity levels associated with the business and 
that's why we say what we're looking at is ROE. That is smart move for us, 
for the business, for our stakeholders, it's accretive to ROE although there 
are some revenues that go with it.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Got it, that's helpful. One of our big competitors took a large charge for FVA 
as they adopted that approach on their derivatives book. Is there 

 
maybe 
you can tell us whether you currently do that or not and whether that's 
something t
hat you're contemplating?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So that obviously refers to the potential implied financing costs around 
collateralized derivatives to the extent that those are observable. We do 
continue to evaluate it. There has been a lot of industry discussion aro
und 
FBA. In our view, transparency has been lacking and today in our opinion 
there is not a basis to take the adjustment. From a risk management 
perspective, we do allocate capital and liquidity down to the product in debt 
level across our sales and tradin
g businesses, so liquidity is allocated based 
on our liquidity funding model which models outflows in a stressed 
environment, and those are as I said allocated down to the product level. So 
from a risk management perspective, the businesses are being charg
ed 
appropriately. That is different from seeing transparency in the marketplace.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Got it. Last one from me, you mentioned FX and having achieved some 
success there in terms of getting the returns to where you want it 
to be. I 
did notice that in the quarter, your FX bar is up a significant percentage of 
where it was before. Does that reflect changes in the business or just market 
volatility?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, the FX flows up quarter
-
over
-
quarter and it just reflects plan a
ctivity.
 
Guy Moszkowski

Your next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Good morning. So within ISG, was there a shift this year to less deferrals 
an
d would that maybe have put a little bit of upward pressure on your GAAP 
comp expense figure, just trying to maybe think about that even if we don't 
get specific numbers just from an area of perspective?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the ISG comp ratio, I think you have t
his, is down from 45% to 42% this 
year. We did bring down the deferral rate as we indicated we would, so the 
deferral rate has come down. And when you think about our comp ratio on a 
go
-
forward basis, our view is that it will trend down to about that 40% 
r
ange.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay. But with deferrals coming out that would have put all else being equal 
even with the comp ratio coming down, some upward pressure on that ratio. 
Isn't that the right way to think about it?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
U
BS
 
Okay, great. And then thinking about a dividend that you guys sort of 
introduced in Slide 13, if you think back to 4Q trailing GAAP earnings when 
you guys submitted a CCAR which clearly includes some headwinds but in 
any event, we know that the Fed sort
 
of looks at that. Very simplistically we 
just apply a 30% payout ratio to that, it would imply a $0.50 dividend per 
year. Any issue with the math on that? You think that people are thinking 
about it that way would be too aggressive?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Let me answ
er it this way. Our view is that the way to maximize return of 
capital over the longer term is to request steady consistent increases in 
capital returns in the interim as opposed to any type of discontinuous move. 
So given the ongoing accretion to capital 
and the higher ratios at Morgan 
Stanley, we think now it's the right time to increase the size of our share 
repurchase program and begin to increase the dividend. But I'd start it with 
our philosophy because I think it's an important way to frame how we th
ink 
about legging in to any kind of change.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay, that's helpful. And as we think about Wealth Management and you 
guys have had terrific momentum there clearly, and your outlook for 
improvement there and kind of with engagement continu
ing to improve, do 
you expect that that would increase the fee rates that you guys get on your 
managed assets? That had been under a little bit of pressure recently and 
it's sort of at lower levels. Does that reflect a lower level of engagement and 
does yo
ur expectation for increased engagement mean that that probably 
should, all else equal, have some upward pressure there?

Okay. And then last one, you guys are looking for like a near doubling of the 
loan book as you laid out in the slide deck from now until 2015. How much 
of that doubling should we count on from Wealth Management versus 
institutional? An
d as we watch the disclosures that you guys gave in the 
supplement, is it mostly in the health or investment volumes that we should 
be watching?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think you have a couple of questions in there. We've laid out the asset 
growth by product and I di
scussed it in a conference earlier in the year. The 
loan growth overall is supporting both, as I said, product and Wealth 
Management as well as institutional securities. So we talked already about 
mortgage and PLA within Wealth Management. In institutional
 
securities, the 
product is similarly very consistent with our client franchise where we have 
strong domain expertise areas like commercial real estate, project finance, 
continuing to expand with our clients. It is primarily HFI. We've really 
migrated to H
FI over the last several years and we see this as prudent, 
steady growth across a suite of products to support growth in those two 
businesses. We've laid out the products and the deck that James went 
though, so you can get a sense of the suite of products 
on both sides.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.

Hi. I think you said the margin ROE targets do not reflect a change in 
interest rate
s, so what is Morgan Stanley sensitivity to higher interest rates, 
for example, or a 100 basis point increase in Fed funds?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We gave two targets and let me make sure we're very clear. When we focus 
on increasing the PVT margin in Wealth Managemen
t, we kept it on a basis 
consistent with the way we described it last year. So last year we had a 
Wealth Management target of 20% to 22%. We said we were holding rates 
and equity markets constant. And so as we hit our 20% PVT margin this 
quarter, excluding
 
the impairments of 20% PBT margin. We took our 
guidance up for Wealth Management and that again is holding rates 

curve. It's holding rates where they are today and holding equity mark
ets 
where they are today. If we now switch over to our ROE walk and look at the 
upside that comes from the bank with respect to the upside in the bank and 
the slides that looks at asset optimization and the yield on the various 
categories, in that we have 
embedded the forward yield curve and nothing 
more than the forward yield curve. So we try to give you a lot of the pieces 
with respect to asset growth and the mix and that assumption so that you 
can do all the sensitivities that you think are appropriate g
iven your outlook 
on the market.
 
Mike Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
So if you did have a 100 basis point increase in fed funds then we could 
assume a higher PBT for the Wealth Management business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, so rates obviously our benefit to the bank overall and to the
 
Wealth 
Management business.
 
Mike Mayo

CLSA
 
You mentioned prime brokerage is back to that level since 2008, is it all the 
way back. I know the business was hurt during the crises and you trying to 
get customers back; are you back at a steady state or you

share?
 
Ruth Porat
 

a quite substantial change overall in prime brokerage over the last several 
years a restructuring of that business and the way the business is fu
nded 

reflecting the strength of it and the overall contribution of the franchise. So 



 
the team continues to deliver.
 
Mike Mayo

CLSA
 
In FICC compared to your peers, it looks like you underperformed and it's 
tough to breakout how much of that underperformance is due to the 
deliberate downsizing versus poor execution, I mean are you satisf
ied with 
the execution this quarter or not?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So a couple of parts to that question as well. As a reminder Fixed Income 
and Commodity is made up of the Fixed Income product and Commodities, 
two separate 

 
two different businesses that on the one h
and Commodities 
on the other, we were substantially weaker in Commodities down 
meaningfully quarter
-
over
-
quarter. The thick revenues excluding 
Commodities are up quarter
-
over
-
quarter not withstanding the bigger drag 
in CVA due to spread tightening. So in o
ur securitized products area in credit 
and foreign exchange they were all up in the quarter. So to your second part 
of your question I feel good about the direction of those businesses, rates 
was down as with the market and our view is that we can continue
 
to do to 

comments.
 
James Gorman
 

movements off of that number which is a fairly modest number to begin with 
to be 
perfectly frank. So I would focus more on the business mix as Ruth 

management has a plan to drive this higher and we come from where they 
plan.
 
Mike Mayo

CLSA
 
And then last question, A
meritrade last quarter said that the wire houses 
have made some moves which may get more difficult on the breakaway 
broker side, and I am not exactly sure what the online broker was referring 

ain 
customers or brokers or how the environments changed from several years 
ago say for example against online brokers or other competitors? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well attrition in our business you can see from the headcount numbers, it 
continue to be very lo
w. It's actually down a bit this quarter from the very 

with the quality of the platform and when you look at our ongoing growth in 

 
think again the clients are

Thanks. Maybe for James, just on the walk the ROE target, I guess I am just 
trying to figure out when I look at the pre tax margin being increased. The 
risk weighted asset reduction coming on sooner, expenses in line, the 
market up 30%, but
 
the ROE target is still in that 9% to 10% plus range if 
we get a better environment too. I guess I am just trying to figure out it 
seems like it should be better I mean it seems like things have gone better 
than current expectations or what the expectatio
ns were a year ago. So 
anyways I am just trying to get a sense on, has some things gone the other 
way to keep the ROE target there or is it just being conservative.
 
James Gorman
 
Listen, this is a journey. Three years ago I think our ROE was close to 2%, 
tw


then we talk about the additional upside, so you control your own 

ve said pretty consistently we were a 
kind of one step at a time management team. The one step is to get us to 

just play it out at a time.

Bank of America Merrill Lyn
ch
 
Okay, thanks. And just as a follow up; based on giving more clarity around 
broker, I mean you guys have been probably more strategic in terms of 
moving forward in FICC, there maybe some other problems but, in any other 
areas in particularly investment m
anagement maybe unlike the merchant 
banking side are things fairly much set or should we be expecting much 
more to change in that part of the business based on what you know on the 
broker side as of now?
 
James Gorman
 

 
investment management business 
plus broker, I mean we had a lot more capital tied up in that business pre
-
crises. The bad news is we wrote a lot it off unfortunately, the good news is 
we now had much of those capital tied up in the business.

The next question will come from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
 
Devin Ryan

JMP Securities
 
Hi, good morning; thanks for taking my questions. So I just want to try to 
ask maybe the
 
interest rate sensitivity question another way. I think the last 
formal update that we received was that a 100 basis point curve shift would 
increase net interest income by about $700 million. So is that still the firms 

ge; can you give us any insight around how 

the benefit of the rate increase do you expect you have to pass along to 
customers?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the rates have moved up a bit since we
 
provided that guidance, and 

out the various component parts of it. You can apply whatever timeline you 
want to it and look at it at various points sometime, and so clearly in risi
ng 
rate environment there would be some, be it mostly higher increase in 
deposit costs as well, but overall we have meaningful operating leverage 
from this. I think again one of the key points for us with respect to the bank 
is the cost structure of the ba



and mortar. We have made the investments, fruitfully all of the i
nvestments 
that needed we continue to invest in the businesses of course in particular to 
continue to improve the customer experience. But as a result the 
incremental margin on this product is very high for Morgan Stanley, 
substantially higher than it is t
oday and it's not just 
--
 

benefited from a rising rate environment and look forward to that whenever 
that may occur, but it's also the cost structure of that business that is very 
different.
 
Devin Ryan 
-
 
JMP Securities
 
Okay, I 
appreciate that color. And then, just with respect to the litigation 
expense, how should we think about that moving forward. I know it's going 
to be lumpy, but can we think that maybe some of the outsized provision 
this quarter could reflect some pull forw
ard from issues that maybe were 
thinking that were going to be addressed next year; just any other 
additional color there would be helpful.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well as James said this reserve coupled with the reserves to date are 
appropriate based on what we now kn
ow and that being said litigation is the 
biggest headway for the industry, but this is obviously a substantial move.
 
James Gorman
 
The key on the litigation is, we wanted to make significant progress. It's 
estimable and probable and working with our legal t
eam and finance and 

progress.
 
Devin Ryan 
-
 
JMP Securities
 
Okay, great. And then, just lastly within the investment banking backlog; 
can you guys give anymore granularity around what you

kind of the businesses from a cyclical perspective kind of where you are 
today versus maybe what you think the upside maybe as we do get a 
cyclical recovery?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the pipeline does remain strong. I think most gratifying is the 
pick up in 

for quite some time now and it's really on the back of more data that 
supports the thesis of global economic growth. We are seeing more cross
-
border activity. We've talked a
bout that on some prior calls. The Century 
deal that we announced early this week is yet another data point in that 
trend. We think that's an important one. I did comment that we're seeing 
more activity with corporate. I think last year much of it was much
 
more 
about financial sponsor activity but now we're also seeing more corporate 
activity. And very valuable is increased participation from Europe as well, 
have pretty subdued there for quite some time. We feel good about where 
this is and if you look hist
orically, M&A still at pretty low levels. Equity 
underwriting momentum continues industry wide and globally and I think 
with debt underwriting, it's less of forward calendar, but given debt related 
financings, expect some ongoing strength in that area as w
ell.

The next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
 
Matt O'Connor 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Good morning. As we think about the ROE progression from rough
ly 7% ex 
the litigations and the noise right now to the 9%, it seems like the 
improvement in PVT is worth about 1% to ROE. And then the FICC and the 
commodity is a big driver. Can you quantify how much ROE upside there is 
from that? And I understand there'
s been a lot of questions asked what the 
revenue opportunities, the expense opportunities and there's constant some 
moving pieces there. But from an ROE point of view if you get FICC and 
Commodities where you want it, how much of a driver is that to firm
-
w
ide 
ROE?
 
Ruth Porat
 
What I'd like to add to it because it's the most important incremental driver 
to ROE is the bank. I've commented on higher yield to asset optimization 
and the cost structure we have. We also have growing deposits and those 
are contractu
al. It's part of the acquisition from Citi that we're now getting in 
1.75 billion of deposits per month to the middle of next year. So the result is 
a higher return on a larger base and given the cost structure, the 
incremental margin is substantial as I'v
e already noted, so essentially just all 
drops to the bottom line. You start with that. I'll let you do your own 
forecasting and map on that plus the Wealth Management, higher 
profitability that we laid out here on this slide. And Fixed Income, yes, we 
are
 
talking steps. We are moving it forward but we're not assuming a 
recovery in the FICC market, so that's not the biggest driver, not much 
there. And then we have more on the expense reduction program to come 
in, as James says, and finally the increasing re
turns of capital over time. So 
I just want to make sure you've got the full list. And again the importance of 
the bank is not to be understated.
 
James Gorman
 
I would just add at a sort of macro level if you think about it simplistically, 
comp to revenue ra
tios aren't going to change a whole lot, certainly going to 
be 

 
we broke them down this year given revenues went up and we would 
expect them to come down as revenues go up. So that's kind of known. The 
firm is being managed very tightly from other non
-
com
p expense basis. We 
have a comprehensive worldwide effort, as Ruth just referred to, making 
progress on that. And we're not going to take our foot off that. We're going 
to be driving those non
-
comps very aggressively. So it's really just the 
question what 
the revenues are. I think the clarity of our expense base is 
probably as high as it's been for a long time. And now, as we said with this 
substantial progress on the litigation behind us, it really is a revenue show 
right now.
 
Matt O'Connor

Deutsche Bank
 
And just a follow

up on the expenses, sorry if I missed it but of the 1.6 
billion of savings, how much is in the run rate either for the full year 2013 or

out the 
key components of it.

The next question will come from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
 
Christian Bolu 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth. Thank you for taking my 
questions. Just a follow
-
up on an earlier question on the 100% growth you 
expect in lend
-
in. Just be helpful to get some color on where you're seeing 
such robust loan demand? Is it completely new loan demand from your 
clients or is it your clients switchin
g from existing lending providers to you? 
And what is it about your lending program that is driving such outsized 
growth relative to the industry?
 
Ruth Porat
 
If I break it down into the two sides of the business that are benefiting most 
from deposits. Firs
t, on the Wealth Management side; lending to clients 
where we have the deep relationship. Their assets are here at Morgan 
Stanley. And what we have talked about is we're underpenetrated relative to 
peers with lending product had not historically been a foc
us for our system. 
And over the last several years, we've been building up the number of bank 
advisors who sit with financial advisors providing the requisite support for 
their client base. So we're starting in a position where we're 
underpenetrated, have 
the client assets with us. This is product the clients 
want. It's simple products. For example, PLA our securities and base lending 
program enables clients to maintain their portfolio as is, but continued to 
invest as they wanted. So it's a very productive
 
add on to the work that 
they're already doing with us. And again, given this is product that's 
significantly over
-
collateralized and as I've said with our existing client base, 
we've had virtually no credit losses to
-
date. It's mostly floating rate produc
t 
and you're seeing growth 

 
we're seeing nice growth in that. It's the bigger 
part of lending growth within Wealth Management and I'll refer you back to 
the conference I did earlier in the year where there's more detail on that 
one. In the mortgage side, 
we are continuing to see strong demand. To be 
fair, it's off of a low base but we were deliberately constraining production 
there, as I already noted, so continuing to see upside in that business. If you 
switch over to the institutional security side, we h
ave historically been 
focused on relationship lending and event lending, if you were to expect, and 
what we're now adding our 

 
well, I always characterize it like sleeves of 
product, all modestly sized that are consistent with the client franchise that 
we
 
have. So this is business that otherwise we were not doing with our 
existing client franchise. This gives us the opportunity to continue to delve 
and that's what we've been doing in areas like commercial, real estate and 
project finance.

Just switching over the capital return, I can see that quantum of capital 
Morgan Stanley can return would be subject to regulatory approval. But as 
you consider the future's capital structure of Morgan Stanley, do you 
envisage being able to return more than a 100% of earnings to shareholders 
in the foreseeable future?
 
James Gorman
 
Listen, I think let's take one step at a time. We're in the CCAR proces
s now. 
We had our first capital outlay last year which was the final acquisitions of 
Smith Barney. We had our first buyback last year since 2008 which was 
starting the $500 million tranche. We're participating in CCAR right now. 
We'll get the results of th
at in the first quarter. Let's just take our 
projections from then on.
 
Christian Bolu 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay. Apologies if I missed this earlier on. But with regards to your 9% ROE 
target what Fixed Income revenue assumption are you making? Is it kind of 
4.2
 
billion you did this year or is it more like fourth quarter's run rate? Just 
trying to get a sense of what's embedded in that 9% ROE target?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The main point, as I said, about the 9% ROE starting point for the firm is 
that within Fixed Income we 
are driving a return on capital that's in excess 
of our cost of capital. And as we indicated, with the steps in Commodities 
there is continued improvement in that ROE. In Fixed Income across a 
number of products we've already reached that type of return lo
oking at 
RWAs or your capital on a normalized basis. We've added foreign exchange 
in 2013 notwithstanding what was challenging 

 
more challenging foreign 
exchange market environment and we are looking to do the same with rate. 
So, it is very much if we are
 
looking at what's the return for the overall firm, 
it is about achieving those types of returns for Fixed Income. But I'll repeat 
what I already said, which is, we are not assuming a recovery in the FICC 
market industry
-
wide in 2014. So, it is not much of
 
a driver to the upside in 
our ROE.
 
Christian Bolu 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Got it. And just lastly from me question on just regulation in the Wealth 
Management space. As one of the largest financial advisor networks in the 
country, just be curious for your thought
s around kind of potential 
amortization of whether there's differences between the SEC and FINRA 
regulated advisors and any potential implications for Morgan Stanley and its 
competitive positioning?
 
James Gorman
 
Boy, that's a pretty broad one. Honestly, we
 
run the business and aspire to 
run it as well as anybody in the industry. We're constructively with the 
regulators. There are obviously some differences across FINRA and SEC but 
I'm not going to get into predicting harmonization impact on us. I would be 
v
ery, very surprised if there are any material impacts on our business based 
upon any harmonization.

The final question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.
 
Eric Wasserstrom

SunT
rust Robinson
 
Thanks very much. Ruth, just to go back to Slide 14 for a moment. 
Obviously, the simple math is that looking at the potential numerator 
benefits gets you to 6 to 6.3. But I'm just curious about the box that you 
have in terms of potential offs
ets which foresights the balance sheet growth, 
I'm just trying to reconcile that with what James indicated the targets are on 
page 11. So does that 
--
 

and driven by the deposit growth over the next two years
?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So on the 
--
 
when we described or show the growth in assets for the bank to 


--
 



deposits and yes it is built into our statements that it will be greater than 
5% in 2015 with growing 
returns of capital. We manage overall the balance 
sheet to put 

 
our balance sheet and capital behind growth areas within the 
firm, so we built in the capacity to have growth within the firm across our 
various businesses including the obvious deposit on bo

one potential offset that has been incorporated into our outlook and the 
greater than 5% and then capital returns I think speaks to itself.
 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
SunTrust Robinson
 
Got it. And so does the same view get you to the SLR targe
t on the bank 
level as well?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We are already at about 6% on the 
--
 
on our larger bank MSBNA and even 
higher than that on the other bank. We capitalized those banks to support 
the growth that we anticipate and so those are already in a strong posi
tion.
 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
SunTrust Robinson
 
Got it. And so just finally on this 
--
 
so as I think about the ROE targets and 
all of this going forward, is it fair to say that the governing issue at this 
stage is much more the compliance with SLR than CCAR cap
ital?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Our view is that we have a very strong flight path to greater than 5% in 

constraint and so the CCAR process is 
--
 
it was obviously an annual process. 
We feel ver
y good about what we have done over the last several years and 
last year with the consistency of the businesses that we have the ongoing 

constraint on that because we built into 
our forward look return, increasing 
returns of capital.

James Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. And good morning, everybody, and thank you for 
joining us. I'm going to take you through the major components of the 
quarter and our announcements this morning before turning the call over to 
Ruth to review the results in detail.
 
First, we made clear progress increasing client share, and this translate
d to 
financial performance. We've seen the benefits of our investment in hiring 
and leadership as we execute across our businesses. In Institutional 
Securities, our trading results demonstrated considerable improvement and 
reflect continued focus and disci
pline while we maintained at/or near the top 
of the league tables in global M&A and equity underwriting. Equity sales and 
trading had an outstanding quarter, its best since the financial crisis, as we 
continue to gain market share across our 3 major busine
sses. In fixed 
income and commodities sales and trading, we made important progress 
versus a year ago in interest rates, and all products were up sequentially.
 
In Global Wealth Management, we're pleased with our progress, and the 
MSSB integration remains o
n track. We delivered higher revenues. However, 
margins were lower as we indicated they would be on the last quarter's 
earnings call. In Asset Management, revenues were solid and asset flows 
gained some momentum.
 
Now secondly, in addition to improvements i
n our operating results, we had 
a significant benefit arising from the completed sale of Revel, which was a 
positive development.
 
Finally, as you're aware, we have a comprehensive strategic partnership with 
MUFG. In that partnership, we've set up two busin
esses in Japan that 
operate on a joint venture basis. One business is operated and risk managed 
by Morgan Stanley. The other is operated and risk managed by MUFG. MUFG 
has a 60% economic interest in each joint venture while ours is 40%. We 
were disappointe
d to announce that there was a significant trading loss in 
the business operated and risk managed by MUFG. Because of the economic 
structure, we will bear 40% of that loss, which drove a $0.26 per share 
impact this quarter.
 
Over the past weeks, the followi
ng things have occurred. MUFG will be 
injecting capital into the business that will partially offset the losses 
consistent with the shareholder agreement. MUFG, with the active input of 
Morgan Stanley, has taken a number of steps to address the issues that
 
gave rise to the loss and to materially de
-
risk the business. Ruth is going to 
discuss each of these steps in the business in more detail. Notwithstanding 
the loss, we remain fully committed to our partnership with MUFG, which we 
regard as powerful and st
rategic. And we're constantly looking for ways to 
extend our relationship around the world.
 
On that note, we are particularly pleased to jointly announce today that 
MUFG will make a full conversion to our common shares of their $7.8 billion 
face value conv
ertible preferred shares. This is a signature event for Morgan 
Stanley and reflects the strength of our ongoing partnership. The conversion 
will reduce annual preferred dividends by nearly $800 million, increase our 
earnings power and further enhance our c
apital ratios. Subsequent to the 
conversion, our capital position is unquestionably strong. It will increase our 
March 31 Tier 1 common ratio by 270 basis points on a pro forma basis.
 
We have made significant progress strategically repositioning the firm a
nd 
moving towards a strong and durable institution while diligently focused on 
cleaning up some legacy issues. Although we've taken major steps to be in a 
position of operating strength, we understand that significantly more 
progress is expected, and it re
mains the focus of this management team. 
This is an institution that is extremely well positioned for the future, no 
matter the environment.
 
So now let me turn it over to Ruth to review our financial results in more 
detail, and then we'll be available for 
questions and answers.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, and good morning. Overall, for the quarter ended March 31, 
income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley was $966 
million, with diluted earnings per share of $0.50 after preferred dividends. I 
w
ill focus my discussion on 2 primary areas: first, the MUFG
-
related items, 
including the JV loss, the portfolio being managed by Morgan Stanley and 
the impact of the pending conversion; second, the operating improvements 
across our businesses globally.
 
Wit
h respect to the MUFG
-
related items, on the JV loss, our 40% economic 
ownership in MUMSS, the joint venture that MUFG operates, resulted in a 
negative equity pickup of $665 million (sic) [$655 million] or $425 million 
after
-
tax, which equates to $0.26 per 
share. The loss was associated with 
trading results and write
-
downs in its fixed income business, operating 
expenses and other costs. This loss is reflected within Institutional Securities 
in the other revenue line item.
 
As James indicated, MUFG is solely 
responsible for maintaining an 
appropriate level of regulatory capital at the MUMSS joint venture as part of 
the short shareholder agreement. Morgan Stanley is not required to add 
capital nor is our ownership in the joint venture diluted when MUFG injects 
capital. There was no capital injection in the first quarter, because MUFG had 
not completed its capital assessment by March 31. They have since 
concluded that they will contribute approximately $370 million of capital in 
April. This will partially mitigat
e the reduction in our book value by 
approximately $145 million and will be reflected in the second quarter. To 
the extent that there are additional losses in the MUMSS joint venture that 
affect regulatory capital, MUFG will be required to inject additiona
l capital. 
Thus, the impact to Morgan Stanley could be partially mitigated from a book 
value perspective.
 
Following the loss, MUFG has embarked on a thorough and strategic risk 
management review and remediation program and is changing the 
leadership and pr
ocess controls at MUMSS. MUFG is holding people 
accountable and moving forward to make necessary changes.
 
Given the restructuring and management changes under way at MUMSS, it 
was viewed as beneficial to transfer a portion of the portfolio that drove the 
l
osses to the Morgan Stanley
-
controlled joint venture in Japan, MSMS. We 
executed the transaction on an arm's length basis taking into consideration 
the size, liquidity and risk of the portfolio as well as the associated capital 
requirements. We will consol
idate the full P&L associated with these 
positions in our fixed income results as we do all of MSMS. MUFG's 60% 
economic interest will continue to flow out of the noncontrolling interest line.
 
And finally with respect to the equity conversion we announced 
today, as 
James mentioned, MUFG will convert its $7.8 billion face value convertible 
preferred into our common stock, subject to regulatory approval and a 
shareholder vote. This will eliminate $784 million in annual preferred 
dividends. This security was n
ot callable by its term other than when our 
stock hit its certain threshold. To effect an early conversion, we agreed on 
what we believe is fair consideration for foregone dividends, and we will be 
paying the premium via the issuance of an incremental 75 m
illion shares of 
common stock.
 
As a result, we will be incurring a charge in the third quarter for this 
dividend based on our stock price at the time of conversion. Pro forma, 
based on yesterday's closing price, this would equate to approximately $2 
billio
n. Total common shares outstanding will increase by approximately 385 
million reflecting the conversion and the dividend payment. After the 
conversion, MUFG will own approximately 22.4% of Morgan Stanley. Pro 
forma, assuming the conversion occurred at Marc
h 31, our Tier 1 common 
ratio is estimated to increase by 270 basis points.
 
Now turning to our firm
-
wide results. We continue to make progress across 
our global platform. Our first quarter revenues were $7.6 billion, down 2% 
sequentially but up 5% when exc
luding DVA in each period, the MUFG
-
related loss this quarter and the CICC gain last quarter. Our noninterest 
expenses were $6.8 billion, up 2% from last quarter on higher compensation 
expenses, partially offset by a decline in noncompensation expenses. Th
e 
firm
-
wide compensation ratio was 57%. Though excluding the impact of the 
MUFG
-
related losses and DVA, the ratio was 51%. Noncompensation 
expenses were $2.4 billion, down 5% from last quarter primarily due to 
lower professional services expenses, partiall
y offset by higher brokerage 
and clearing.
 
We are focused on driving down our cost structure further through business 
reengineering. In February, we announced the creation of an office of 
reengineering and expense management under our COO and have 
commence
d a 3
-
year program targeting $1 billion in annual run rate 
savings.
 
Results for the quarter also included a tax benefit of $447 million or $0.30 
per share related to the completed sale of Revel. The benefit arose from the 
remeasurement of a deferred tax as
set and the resulting release of a related 
valuation allowance. Excluding this discrete tax gain and the effect of the 
MUMSS loss, the quarterly effective tax rate from continuing operations 
would have been 28%. Book value at the end of the quarter was $31
.45 per 
share while tangible book value was $26.97 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $836 billion at March 31, up 
$28 billion sequentially driven by higher client demand. Although our 
calculations are not final, we believe our Tier
 
1 capital ratio under Basel I will 
be approximately 16.7% and our Tier 1 common ratio will be approximately 
11.8%. Pro forma at March 31 for the pending conversion of MUFG's 
convertible preferred equity, our Tier 1 common ratio would be 
approximately 14.5
%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was affected by the change in 
the treatment of trust preferred securities, or TruPS, effective March 31. This 
capital is now limited to 15% of core capital and, therefore, approximately 
$4 billion of TruPS are now classified as 
Tier 2. This change does not impact 
our Tier 1 common ratio. Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected to 
be approximately $300 billion at March 31. We remained focused on RWA 
mitigation and optimization, and the decrease in RWAs versus December 31 
c
ame from a combination of business mix, analytics and collateral changes.
 
Now turning to our businesses. Institutional Securities revenues of $3.6 
billion included the impact of the MUFG
-
related losses mentioned earlier and 
the negative impact from the tig
htening of credit spreads on firm
-
issued 
structured notes, commonly referred to as DVA, of approximately $189 
million or $0.08 per share. Sequentially stronger trading results were driven 
by increased client flow but were partially offset by lower volumes 
in 
Investment Banking reflecting typical seasonal patterns. Noninterest 
expenses were $3.2 billion in the quarter, flat from the fourth quarter. The 
compensation ratio was 54% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the 
MUFG
-
related losses and DVA, the rat
io was 44%. The business reported a 
pretax profit of $397 million.
 
Investment Banking revenues were $1 billion, down from the fourth quarter 
on lower industry volumes but up nearly 15% from a year ago. This was our 
strongest first quarter in Investment Ban
king since 2007. For the quarter, 
Morgan Stanley ranked first, again, in global announced and completed M&A, 
and we were third in global equity. We led significant deals, including 3 of 
the top 5 transactions in global announced M&A. In the quarter, we adv
ised 
on a number of significant transactions, including Deutsche Telekom's $39 
billion sale of T
-
Mobile to AT&T, the $15.2 billion merger of ProLogis and 
AMB Property and HCA Holdings' $4.4 billion IPO. Advisory revenues of $385 
million were down 20% seque
ntially driven by lower activity in the Americas.
 
Equity underwriting revenues were $285 million, significantly lower than the 
fourth quarter and reflected industry volumes that declined by nearly half 
following the record issuance level last 
quarter, particularly in Asia. Fixed
-
income underwriting revenues of $338 million declined 9% from last quarter 
as higher investment grade issuance was more than offset by lower loan 
syndication and municipal finance fees.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues
 
of $1.7 billion included negative DVA of 
$30 million and represent our highest reported quarter since the financial 
crisis. Results were strong across our businesses and in each major 
geography driven by broad
-
based increases in client flows as we continu
e to 
make targeted investments. Of note, our European and Asian businesses 
were up significantly versus the fourth quarter. In addition, the U.S. equity 
research department improved its ranking to #3 in its 2011 Greenwich 
analyst and PM surveys, up from se
venth and eighth, respectively, in 2010.
 
Cash equity revenues were up over 10% from the fourth quarter as a result 
of sustained market share gains, alongside client and geographic 
diversification, outperforming against a market backdrop of muted volumes 
in
 
the U.S., volatility in Asia and growth in Europe. Derivatives outperformed 
in the quarter on expanded client footprint with sequentially higher client 
flows against the backdrop of elevated volatility arising from global macro 
events. Growth in our elect
ronic businesses in cash equities and derivatives 
continued to outpace market volume. And prime brokerage recorded the 
highest level of client balances since the financial crisis as we continue to 
focus on innovation and client service.
 
Fixed income and co
mmodities sales and trading revenues of $1.8 billion 
included negative DVA of $159 million. Results benefited from an increased 
client activity and better facilitation, with particular strength in Europe, while 
all product lines showed improvement from the
 
fourth quarter. We continued 
to invest in the electronic trading platform for this business.
 
Interest Rate's revenues more than doubled from the previous quarter on 
strong client flows across all regions, particularly Asia, and included 
increased electron
ic share in Europe and more sustained activity in the U.S. 
We continued to make progress growing this business, where revenues were 
up 10% on a year
-
over
-
year basis, in particular, liquid flow rates were up 
over 50%.
 
Credit revenues increased meaningfully 
versus the fourth quarter with 
particular strength in securitized products. They were down from the prior 
year reflecting a quieter market in corporate credit.
 
FX revenues were also up on higher trading revenue versus the fourth 
quarter despite muted FX vo
latility during most of the quarter. We recorded 
our single largest electronic trading day in FX this quarter.
 
Commodities revenues were up significantly from the fourth quarter due to 
increased market volatility. Fixed income results continued to reflect 
a drag 
from the tightening of monoline credit spreads in CMBX indices with net 
losses of $318 million. Other sales and trading negative revenues of $458 
million primarily reflected losses on economic hedges related to the firm's 
long
-
term debt and funding 
costs related to the higher amount of liquidity 
held by the firm's U.S. subsidiary bank.
 
Turning to VaR. Average trading VaR declined to $121 million from $132 
million last quarter primarily driven by reductions in credit and foreign 
exchange.
 
Global Wealt
h Management revenues of $3.4 billion increased 3% 
sequentially as higher Asset Management fees and commissions were 
partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenues due to a quieter new 
issue calendar. Noninterest expenses were $3.1 billion, up 4% fr
om last 
quarter on higher compensation expenses. The compensation ratio of 62% 
in the quarter continues to be driven primarily by the formulated grid 
payout. Integration costs were approximately $80 million. Profit before tax 
was $348 million, and the PBT 
margin was 10%.
 
Total client assets increased sequentially to $1.7 trillion on market 
appreciation and net asset inflows of $11.4 billion in the quarter. Net fee
-
based asset flows were $17.8 billion. As you consider the second quarter, 
note that client flo
ws tend to be seasonally weak due to tax filings.
 
The number of FAs was 17,800, within our expected range, while turnover 
within our top 2 quintiles remained near historic lows. The decline in 
headcount was due to our focus on reducing low performing FAs, 
which 
could result in further reductions next quarter.
 
Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $112 billion, of which $54 billion 
is held by Morgan Stanley Bank. With respect to the second quarter, 
implementation of the new FDIC assessment rules may resu
lt in significantly 
higher FDIC charges related to the Citi depositories, which are part of the 
MSSB bank deposit sweep program, partially offset by lower FDIC charges 
related to the Morgan Stanley depositories in the same program. It is 
expected that Citi
 
will take actions to mitigate most of the impact sometime 
during the third quarter. In addition, fed funds is half of what it was in the 
fourth quarter and well below where it was during the first 3 months this 
year. As you know, we have some sensitivity 
to rates, and the movement 
could pressure net interest margins.
 
Let me turn to Asset Management, where starting this year, we have 
organized this segment around 3 businesses. We have aligned our AUM and 
asset flow disclosure and provided the revenue breako
ut for these 
businesses in the supplement. The first is Traditional Asset Management, 
which includes our Long
-
Only, Liquidity and AIP fund of funds businesses, 
and where revenues declined 6% from the fourth quarter to $325 million.
 
The second is Real Estat
e Investing, where revenues of $118 million declined 
on lower investment gains. Approximately $42 million was related to 
investment gains from consolidated mezz rep funds. Given the ownership 
structure of these funds, the majority of the gains are passed t
o third
-
party 
investors in the noncontrolling interest line.
 
The third is Merchant Banking, which includes our private equity and 
infrastructure businesses and our hedge fund investments, where revenues 
of $183 million included lower investment gains in pr
ivate equity and lower 
management fees as well as the absence of a full quarter of revenues 
related to FrontPoint. PBT was $127 million for a margin of 27 
--
 
of 20%.
 
The Traditional Asset Management business reported strong margins in the 
quarter. Total AU
M increased to $284 billion as market appreciation and net 
asset inflows of $1.4 billion were partly offset by the reduction in FrontPoint 
AUM. Inflows were driven by equity and liquidity assets. As of February 
2011, over 74% of our long
-
term strategies co
ntinued to outperform their 
respective benchmarks on a 3
-
, 5
-
 
and 10
-
year basis.
 
Now turning to our outlook. We are cautiously optimistic about the operating 
environment with healthy liquidity and increased confidence providing 
tailwinds for our capital ma
rkets and advisory businesses. Risk assets have 
been resilient with markets absorbing and recovering from macro and 
geopolitical moves more quickly than in prior periods. However, concerns 
remain regarding the potential slowing pace of the U.S. growth, par
ticularly 
at the impact of monetary fiscal stimulus wanes as well as ongoing stresses 
in Europe. These contradictory factors were evident in what we would 
characterize as moderate risk taking in the first quarter, but an improvement 
from the risk
-
on, risk
-
off environment of much of last year.
 
Beyond the operating environment, we are benefiting from the strategic 
moves and investments that we have made. First, we are pleased with the 
pending equity conversion that puts us in an even stronger capital position
. 
And most notably, within our business segments, we saw ongoing progress 
in many areas in sales and trading. In fixed income, we continue to see the 
benefits of our investments to broaden our footprint. And in equities, our 
team globally was able to captu
re additional market share. We remain very 
focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy to continue enhancing 
our global footprint and growing our share of the market to deliver for clients 
and shareholders.
 
Thank you, and now we will take your que
stions.

Crédit Suisse AG
 
Congratulations on the announcement of the MUFG conversion. I think one 
of the overhangs I've certainly 
heard is you've got a lot of capital, but the 
quality of the capital was a bit challenged. So this certainly alleviates that. I 
think assuming you receive approval, Ruth, how does that change your 
capital management priorities in the context of both Basel 
I and Basel III?
 
Ruth Porat
 
That' s a very good and fair question, but a bit premature. We're delighted 
to be announcing this, this morning. As you said, it does meaningfully 
improve our Tier 1 common. Delighted to be up at 14.5% pro forma, but we 
still ne
ed to go through final regulatory approval and shareholder vote. I 
think, overall, it puts us in a very strong position with added flexibility, and 
we'll be back to you more on that in the future.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Okay, thanks. And then 
switching over to the results, you noted the 
monoline
-
related losses again this quarter. Could you just update us on 
where exposures stand at the end of the quarter? And what we should be 
looking at in terms of thinking about future losses and/or gains?
 
Ru
th Porat
 
Certainly. So as we said before, this is a legacy exposure that will take time 
to work out. It's unfortunately not as straightforward as it may appear, 
because there are a number of factors in play and correlations are breaking 
down. So in additio
n to normal credit considerations, there's regulatory and 
litigation overlay. We're continuing to evaluate the market in all positions. 
So you're going to see more disclosure in our Q. As you would expect, we 
have adjusted some of our hedges, and that will
 
be detailed in the Q.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Okay, thanks. And finally, you noted the RWAs were down during the 
quarter. Is that more environmental driven, or is that a function of getting 
ready for Basel III?
 
Ruth Porat
 
It's really our approach a
nd focus on RWA mitigation and optimization. 
We've put more resources, people and analytics behind our RWA 
management. And as a result, it enabled us to identify opportunities to really 
optimize RWA. It's a combination of business mix change, analytics and
 
changes in collateral. And we're focusing on Basel I now, but intend to use 
that same discipline focusing forward on 2.5 and III.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Okay, thanks. And just follow up to that, Ruth, I guess as you look to that 
RWA optimization, 
I mean, how do you think about the P&L ROA type of 
impact from mitigating those RWAs?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So what we talked about here, the reduction from $330 billion down to $300 
billion did not have a P&L impact.

The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Ruth, if we could just do quickly, the pro forma tangible book and fully 
diluted share count post the conversion, I mea
n, the $25.63 range and 1.85 
billion. Is that about right?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the tangible book is around $25.78, book value, $29.36.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
And fully diluted, I just add the shares, nothing special there in the math?
 
Ruth Por
at
 
Right, right.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
And then so what's interesting is your leverage is running 17.2x on common. 
This immediately takes it under 15. Just curious if you think about that as 
the right range, you knew this was coming ver
sus is there an ability or any 
thought process on letting the balance sheet drift up a little now that you 
have a lot more common underneath it?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So this quarter, our balance sheet obviously did drift up, moved up from 
fourth quarter. It was 
lower at the end of the fourth quarter on, basically, 
client activity, and we took it up as we saw client activity. I think the real 
point here is that we're very pleased with the ongoing success we have in 
equities and fixed income, and that's really driv
en the demand for 
incremental balance sheet, which we've used. Clearly, this provides a very 
strong Tier 1 common base. But what was driving the balance sheet move 
fourth quarter over first quarter was client activity and executing on our 
strategy.
 
Glenn S
chorr

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Okay, so let's talk about that. I think you do deserve the credit for the 
progress there. Could we, inside of [indiscernible] talk about 
--
 
I know 
commodities is operating towards peak levels right now. I think that 
conti
nues. But do you mind making a comment specifically on rates and FX, 
where a lot of the build has been? And what kind of contributors that was to 
the good results this quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Certainly. So rates had very strong performance. It was up year
-
over
-
year 
and quarter
-
over
-
quarter in a choppy market. I think what you're really 
seeing is the results from the build that we've done, the strong leadership 
we have there, the additional talent added to our team globally. It really 
makes a difference. I think
 
our point that we've talked about in the past is 
the need to build out the team to have greater presence with clients, which, 
in turn, would drive greater opportunity for client facilitation, and that was 
very much borne out this quarter. What you'll see 
in the 10
-
Q, when you 
look at our trading histogram is that it has moved over to the right. And 
again, another way of underscoring that with the addition of the team, 
greater presence of clients, greater client facilitation opportunities, that 
we're produc
tive.
 
James Gorman
 
I would just add, Glenn, this is the first time that I have felt comfortable 
with the leadership across all of our fixed
-
income businesses. Moving Kenny 
deRegt, who ran fixed income 10
-
plus years ago, left the firm, came back to 
run risk
 
and is now back running the business, his unique talent and mature, 
very capable trading executive. And under Kenny, the 4 or 5 players that he 
now has, really a world
-
class team. So leadership starts at the top. You've 
got to have that ability at the top
. And the investment we made in hiring 
people, combined with the leadership at the top, I think is what started to 
move the needle.
 
Glenn Schorr

The next question will come fr
om Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.
 
Guy Moszkowski

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
I think it would be really helpful if maybe you could take us through a little 
bit more detail on how you achieved the reduction in the RWA even as the 
assets went up, because this
 
mitigation thing is so important, I think, for us 
to understand.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It's really 
--
 
as I described, we built up the team that focusing on RWA 
optimization. And so the combination of business mix, as well as analytics, 
as well as looking at changes 
in collateral, has just yielded benefits, which 
one can candidly say, ""It would have been nice to have had sooner,"" but 
we're pleased to have put the resources behind it to identify it. And these 
are Basel I improvements. I don't want to leave you with the
 
notion that it 
necessarily rolls forward to Basel III. Some of them, we give up again in 
Basel II. And that's why I made the point that we're using the same 
approach to make sure that we're capturing all opportunities now in Basel I, 
but we're going to mo
ve this to 2.5 and III. So when I look to our Basel III 
guidance, it stays very much the same. I wouldn't want to leave you with 
the suggestion you can build off of that.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. But it sounds like you are trying to iden
tify opportunities to further 
this, even on a Basel I basis, and achieve more on a Basel III basis than 
maybe what you would have thought a few months ago you could do. Or is 
that not fair?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, no, that's very fair. The Basel III numbers that 
we talked about 
previously kind of inflation, passive mitigation, net up 140, $140 billion. We 
still think it's an appropriate way to look at it. We don't have any change to 
our earlier guidance of $480 billion of risk
-
weighted assets under Basel III. 
Howe
ver, very much to your point, we intend to take the same focus apply it 
to 2.5 and III. And in addition, there are opportunities on active mitigation. 
But at this point, there are 2 steps, which is let's take this forward to 2.5 
and III, see what else it y
ields and then see what we want to do beyond 
that.

Okay then, that's very helpful. Thank you. I was also hoping that maybe you 
could give us a little bit more color on the other sales and trading loss, which 
you refer to
 
as being related to some of the economic hedges, I guess one 
on the corporation's balance sheet. I'm not sure that I understand it. And 
obviously, the losses are significant enough that it would be helpful to 
understand if those could 
--
 
if those are goin
g to be mitigated ahead, or how 
we should model that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. So as we've discussed previously, this line item is volatile. And it 
unfortunately is difficult to model, because it includes a number of different 
items in it. So for example, we have 
amortizing hedges from debt we bought 
back in 2008 and 2009 in there, current long
-
term debt hedging program, 
our U.S. bank liquidity portfolio, leveraged loans and relationship lending. 
And so while we have negative in this line item, there are often also
 
positive 
offsets. And that's what we had last quarter, we had some positive offsets. 
Unfortunately this quarter, the items all went the wrong way. And that's the 
negative. That's the drag.
 
Guy Moszkowski

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, thanks for that. And the
n the final question that I have is on equity, 
because obviously you've had a very, very successful result in the quarter. 
And I guess the question that we have to ask ourselves is how much of this 
is really sort of permanent, no, permanent is never the ri
ght word, but 
sustainable improvement from some of the footprint improvements that 
you've had and the like? And to what extent might you just have had a very 
favorable outcome from volatility
-
related equity derivatives trading? Can you 
help us with that at
 
all, just so we don't overestimate what you might be 
able to achieve in the quarters ahead?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, absolutely. We are very pleased with the performance. And I think 
you've hit the 2 issues. First and foremost, we have a terrific team around 
the g
lobe. This is really 
--
 
the strength is broad based. It's across products. 
It's across geographies, and it is about very strong team. Cash equities was 
very strong; derivatives as well; prime brokerage, as I noted. So I think it 
starts with the team and th
e stronger presence in front of clients that they're 
executing extremely well. We certainly also benefited, as you noted, from a 
constructive market. So for example, in derivatives, we certainly benefited 
from the market, but it was the team, with the back
drop of constructive 
market, they executed well against it.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.

Credit Agricole Securities (

All my questions are on the MUFG conversion. I just wanted to clarify some, 
maybe some simple things. So you eliminate $784 million in dividends. 
That's a $0.53 picku
p once you do that. Is that correct? So that's kind of in 
the bag?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I'm going to count on you doing the math right, the $784 million of 
dividends. Preferred dividends, to clarify.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc.
 
Right. So I'm just trying to understand how I would adjust my normalized 
estimates. So if my normalized number is $4, or $5 or $6, let's use $4 for 
the moment. So the increase in shares outstandin
g would be diluted by 1/4, 
which would take the $4 number down to $3. Then you'd add back that 
$0.53, and then normalized earnings power would be $3.53, not the $4. So 
it seems like normalized earnings would go down. And I want you to correct 
my logic. On 
the other hand, you have a mid
-
teen to ROE target. If you 
maintained that ROE target on a higher capital base, that would imply a 
higher normalized number. So if you could help me see my way through 
that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So you've got a number of components to 
it. I'm going to address some of 
them, and then we'll just follow up on some of the math after the call. 
Because this conversion, we've been focused on getting the conversion 
done, and you're going into some of the numbers that I don't have in front 
of me.
 
So you're right on the $784 million of preferred dividends. As I 
indicated, we're paying a premium with the incremental 75 million shares, so 
the total common shares up 385 million. As we look at it with respect to 
--
 
and so we'll come back to you on the 
earnings. What you're asking about 
ROE and really driving ROE on the strong capital base, we remain very 
comfortable with our mid
-
teens target over the cycle and come at it a 
number of different ways. Starts with our revenue mix and the right revenue 
mix g
lobally. We think we're very well positioned for a changing regulatory 
environment, and we're executing across the businesses and geographies. 
And you see that, I think quite clearly, in the results here this quarter. So 
revenue upside in Institutional Sec
urities, driving equities further based on 
the strengths that we've just talked about. And on fixed income, as we've 
talked about in the past, we're very focused on the initial closing the gap of 
2% market share points, and the benefit that, that actually 
drives to the 
bottom line. Investment Banking is at a cyclical low given the strength of our 
Investment Banking franchise. We view that as a real positive. And 
obviously, there's a flow
-
through to other businesses from the new issue 
business that comes out
 
of the Investment Banking franchise. There's the 
upside from GWM as we drive our PBT margin to the 20% target we've 
talked about in the past. The expense management program that we've 
talked about is incremental operating leverage. And then finally at som
e 
point, back to one of the prior questions, capital management's an added 
lift. So that's how we look to the ROE, and we'll come back to you on some 
of the builds.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc.
 
And then maybe 
--
 
you get $7.8 billion of additional common equity, if that's 
correct. So your tangible common would go up 19%, but your shares 
outstanding would go up by 25%. Am I doing the math correct, and if I am, 
why is so much more in t
he shares than the increase in the common?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We also have the incremental premium that we're paying, which is a deduct. 
So that, as I noted, will be a charge of about $2 billion based on yesterday's 
closing price.
 
Michael Mayo

Credit Agricole Se
curities (

The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.
 
Roger Freeman

Barclays Capital
 
Just a couple more on MUFG. I guess, one, can you help us t
hink about 
--
 
and you talked about the larger sort of strategic benefit of the relationship, 
and maybe just put into context some of the benefits that you've gotten out 
of that partnership so far? I'm just thinking of can we look at this in a some 
sort of 
cumulative context? And have there been any meaningful profits?
 
James Gorman
 
Firstly, on a pure financial basis, the investment that MUFG made during the 
financial crisis was obviously critical to repositioning us. The contribution to 
the various equity raises has also been critical, and we put in place a 
number of different busine
ss initiatives around the world. One of them was 
the formation of these double joint ventures in Japan. And while we have 
clearly had a stumble in the trading book on the fixed
-
income side of the 
business that they've been running, the long
-
term opportunit
y, the strategic 
opportunity in Japan giving us access to the retail market, which is a very 
large portion of the market there for distribution of our institutional product, 
and putting Morgan Stanley in a position to take Japanese corporates 
outside of Ja
pan for their M&A and capital raising needs is a very compelling 
sort of strategic objective. Secondly, we have worked with MUFG and Bank 
of Tokyo subsidiary to bring them into a number of client relationships, 
where we're leveraging the combined balance s
heet of both institutions. And 
I think the number 
--
 
I forget the exact number, but we're up over the 50 to 
60 instances where we've done that. They did their first sub
-
investment 
grade deal with us. So there are number of opportunities for them to do 
that
. Thirdly, as we look at various smaller emerging markets around the 
world, where they have a presence and capability, we might want to build 
the infrastructure. We're looking at ways where we can leverage their 
infrastructure. And then finally in the Unit
ed States, they have operations 
here in both retail and commercial banking. So it's a very broad
-
based 
partnership. And again, obviously it's stumbled, but the evidence of the 
strength of the partnership, this truly moving investment here that they've 
made
, and repositions us in lots of ways.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
Okay, that's helpful. And then just thinking about the premium you're paying 
to convert to preferred early, kind of paying the next couple of years of the 
preferred dividend. And is it 
just the certainty of having the common equity 
contribution today as opposed to not sure whether the stock price is at the 
conversion point 2 years from now and there might still be a cost then? Have 
you had to negotiate something?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, I'm go
ing to let Ruth, she can take you through the mechanics. The 
bottom line here is, what we have spent the last couple of years doing is 
clearing up a number of uncertainties that impact our future, and this was 
frankly #1 on my list for this year. And we ha
d a window of opportunity here 
to get this off the list, and obviously, we had to pay premium. We think it's a 
fair and balanced 
--
 
Ruth will take you through them.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So to that point, the security is not callable by its terms, which is customary 
for this type of security. And so we and they value the security with all 
relevant factors, share price, discount rate, volatility led to what we think is 
a fair outcome. And it really goes to James' point, which is this creates 
certainty which we believe 
really drives additional benefits for clients and all 
of our stakeholders.
 
James Gorman
 
And I just like to say, not to overstate this. But getting this done in this 
timeframe with all the Japanese partners are dealing with in Tokyo now is a 
measure of the 
strength of the partnership that they were willing to focus on 
this, that the CEO and board level and our board level, to get this done.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
I appreciate that. Last question, in terms of your positioning sort of post
-
Dodd
-
Frank
, Basel III sort of final clarity and how you might be thinking 
about any response to that from a resizing perspective. I think a lot of 
dealers have to kind of go through this process. My question for you is 
because you've been sort of in a rebuilding pro
cess, is it fair to assume that 
you kind of had some aspect of this outcome in mind and that your 
restaffing has been focused in businesses that likely have sort of brighter 
futures than others, and then ultimately there may be less of a headcount 
challeng
e for you than maybe some of your competitors?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think you framed it well. The focus is very much, for us, a client
-
centric 
flow business, and that plays into much of the direction of much of the 
regulation. I think when you talk about some of t
he areas like derivatives, 
clearly there's a lot still to be done with respect to derivatives legislation. 
And we do want to 
--
 
we are focused on the need to ensure that U.S. 
institutions broadly aren't disadvantaged relative to global for other firms or 
E
uropean firms. But when you think about Morgan Stanley, I think there are 
ways that we are relatively advantaged versus peers. And we've talked 
about that in the past, the ability for us to move derivatives into the bank, 
the fact that the focus really is 
on client service and research support for our 
client, then it's giving us an opportunity here with our technology and 
connectivity leveraging off we're doing in, for example, foreign exchange and 
PB, to set ourselves up well for this new world. So we do f
eel that, in many 
ways, the market is going the direction that we're going. We still are 
somewhat smaller in fixed income on headcount, and so that very much, to 
your point, is beneficial given where the market's going.

The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.
 
Michael Carrier

Deutsche Bank AG
 
Ruth, last quarter, you gave some details on the Wealth Management 
business. Just in terms of some of the factors that
 
can push the margin up 
over time, more environmental, and then there was also a portion that's 
more what Morgan Stanley can do in terms of consolidating platforms, 
realizing some of the additional synergies. So just wanted to focus on that 
portion. From a
 
timing standpoint, are we still looking at 
--
 
I think you guys 
are saying like the beginning of 2012, but I just wanted to make sure like 
any update on the synergy, the consolidation on what you guys can control 
versus the environment?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the 3
 
pillars, as I call it, that drive margin expansion, first, as you just 
referenced, completion of the integration and the synergies that come from 
having integrated the various platforms. We are moving the Morgan Stanley 
FAs onto this platform by the end o
f the third quarter where they'll be 
training up the Smith Barney FAs. They move on in the first half of 2012. So 
that's a very important part of this integration timeline. The second part and 
very important is building up the private banking business beca
use that, as 
we've talked about in the past, is where we build our noncompensable 
revenues. And that, we are systematically building. We had 160 bankers at 
the end of the year. We have 178 at the end of the first quarter, which is 
ahead of our, what was ou
r major target of 180, and we're looking to add 
about 30 a year. So this is a slow steady build to make sure we're providing 
the right client experience, the right risk management, the right 
--
 
full 
infrastructure around it. But that's an important part, a
nd that will take time 
to build to the point where it really moves the needle. And then to your 
point, the third part, which we don't control but I did reference in the 
opening comments, is the backdrop, the 100 basis points movement in 
equity, the point o
n our PBT margin. And fed funds, we're focused on, 
because they're down from 19 basis points in the fourth quarter to 10 basis 
points here as we're going into the second quarter, second quarter to date. 
And every 50 basis points in fed funds is about 1 poi
nt on PBT margin. We 
look forward to that turning around.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
And then just to follow up on the ROE. You gave a few points, I think, on 
one of the last questions, just in terms of getting the ROE up over time. So I 
think you 
mentioned like 5 areas, so overall activity levels, which we'll see 
anyone can predict. You guys have the target in the Global Wealth 
Management business in terms of the improvement in the margin, so we can 
gauge that and size that opportunity. So I guess 
in terms of the 2 others or 
maybe 3 others, like the size of a trading opportunity in terms of punching 
at your weight or getting it to a level that's a better run rate. And then just 
on the cost side, I guess on those 2 areas when you look at the ROE and 
the 
impact of those businesses or those new initiatives have, is there any way to 
size that up? And not like next quarter or the quarter after but over the next 
year or 2 in terms of how much that can contribute?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, I'll give you a couple of 
data points to use to size it up and then look 
forward to reading how you write it up. But within the fixed income side, 
we're targeting an initial 2% wallet share growth, and that's steady, 
consistent. I think what you're seeing in the results this quarte
r give us 
confidence that you're seeing that borne out through the P&L, but that's a 
2% upside. 2% market share upside is an important first metric that we are 
looking at in managing, too. And then with respect to the cost program, I 
mentioned the office o
f reengineering under our COO that was announced 
early this year. He is targeting and identified a $1 billion of run rate 
expenses to come out of the business. That is a 3
-
year reengineering effort. 
He has identified a number of different areas, but it doe
s take time when 
you're doing substantive reengineering in that regard.

Our final question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
 
James Mitchell

Buckingham Research 
Group, Inc.
 
Just to follow up on the JV. I understand that this was an unusual quarter, 
but you were losing money in the JV over the prior 9 months, and 
understandably, it's got some strategic value. But how do we think about it 
-
-
 
how do you guys evaluate
 
that longer term? Is there really value to be had 
there, particularly when you're giving up risk management? Is it sort of 
worth the effort?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, firstly, there are 2 businesses there. So the JV has 2 businesses, and 
one of them certainly ha
s been making money. But secondly it's in its early 
stages. It was only formed in May. We have a lot of things that are going on 
in discussions about restructuring that particular business, which MUFG is 
going through and Ruth talked about. And we believe 
there are other 
potential synergies across both of those businesses for reducing the cost 
base in the infrastructure. So yes, from a cost perspective, we think it can 
be more efficient. From a risk management perspective, they're putting in 
place a number 
of changes at the leadership and the process level. And from 
a cost strategic perspective, to have access to the Japan retail market and 
have access to taking Japanese corporates globally is a major strategic move 
for us that we're frankly continue to be a
s excited as we were when we 
started. This is a stumble. We're disappointed with it. They're disappointed 
with it. They're putting in place the appropriate changes, but it's not 
something that's going to knock us off sort of 10
-
year vision for our business
 
in Japan.
 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
 
So you see a pretty reasonable path to profitability there is basically what 
you're saying.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, in time. But as you know, obviously, the Japanese markets have been 
under pressure, an
d it's going to take some time to align the cost bases of 
the these businesses where we have combined in that market.
 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
 
Okay, great. And, Ruth, on the risk
-
weighted assets, you still targeting $480 
billion und
er Basel III. That's inclusive of the mitigation, right, of about $100 
billion, I think, is the numbers. And then how do we think about 
--
 
you had 
mitigation on Basel I. Was, I guess I'll ask it again, was there any kind of 
mitigation related to Basel III 
yet? Or is that still to come and you still 
expect that to come?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So on Basel III, we're still guiding agents still, for now, look at $480 billion, 
net of passive mitigation. So as I said, we're not giving ourselves credit at 
this point for 
the Basel I RWA mitigation rolling through the Basel 2.5 and 
III, but we do intend to use that same focus as we look at 2.5 and III. So if 
you just hold to where we were previously, we'll continue to give you 
updates. That includes only passive mitigation.
 
There are obviously other 
things that are quite logical like tariffs, and potentially, benefits from central 
clearing. But I think the other point is that in our prior guidance on Basel III, 
we were talking about 8% to 10% Tier 1 common by the end of 2012
 
with 
consensus earnings and the various other things we've talked about. The 
10% number was contingent on the conversion of the MUFG convertible 
preferred, which we obviously now address today. So that's the only real 
update on that topic.
 
James Mitchell

Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
 
But none of the passive mitigation has come through yet?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, on behalf of III, no.

-

f the hedging loss for MBIA exposure or no?

James P. Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be able to talk 
to 
you about our performance in these turbulent markets. Our businesses 
demonstrated resilience with strength across a number of our institutional 
areas, complemented by stability among retail investors and ongoing 
performance in MSSB. I'm also happy that we 
will be finally able to address 
some of the concerns and misinformation that have weighed on the stock of 
late.
 
While it was tempting to address some of the issues as they arose, frankly, 
our view is that addressing every rumor is counterproductive. When R
uth 
walks you through the numbers, it should be apparent that the biggest 
challenge we face of late is subdued client activity. In fact, overall, we were 
modestly profitable in the quarter.
 
Our firm and our system have derisked, both strategically and fina
ncially, 
which provides the type of stability needed in all times but particularly in 
challenging markets. Clearly, we're in a very dynamic environment and our 
journey is not done. But the U.S. financial system in general and Morgan 
Stanley in particular h
as made far more progress than it is being given 
credit.
 
On the topic of the financial system, a few quick words. The regulatory 
landscape continues to evolve. We're managing our business with an eye 
towards Basel III and the SIFI buffer. We're already abo
ve the 7% Basel III 
base requirement for Tier 1 common and are confident about our ability to 
reach required levels in the appropriate time horizon.
 
On the liquidity front, while we are significantly above proposed LCR ratios, 
we believe the regulators are
 
doing the right thing for the system and the 
economy by taking another look at the calibration for those requirements.
 
In regards to Volcker, it's far too early to determine the impact on our 
business model and the industry. We understand the regulators a
re trying to 
strike the right balance of preventing prop trading by depositor institutions, 
but at the same time allowing for market making in liquid markets.
 
As we have repeatedly said, we have, over the past 3 years, taken the steps 
Volcker was designed 
to address. We have shut down our pure prop trading 
desk, we've spun our front point, we have announced plans to spin off PDT 
and we have meaningfully reduced the capital levels we intend to invest in 
support of the merchant bank.
 
It is critical that the V
olcker Rule does not restrict activities necessary for 
market making in liquid markets. We and the rest of the industry have an 
opportunity now to weigh in on these issues during the upcoming comment 
period.
 
Let's turn to the environment. Market conditions
 
are challenging. We're 
constantly reassessing whether we are experiencing something that is 
secular or cyclical and under what conditions we would act to shrink or 
change businesses, product lines, our overall balance sheet and our level of 
risk
-
weighted 
assets.
 
I want to be very clear about something. We will continue to make whatever 
decisions are necessary if we indeed determine we are experiencing a 
secular change. We're not myopically focused on SIs, only on the returns we 
generate for shareholders. W
e will optimize our business mix and our 
balance sheet to generate returns that you should expect from us.
 
We're all very focused on expenses. Ruth will walk you through an update of 
our cost
-
cutting program, and I want to briefly address compensation as i
t's 
clearly an important lever to drive returns.
 
We will be balanced and remain focused on protecting our important 
franchises and paying those employees who are delivering differential value. 
At the same time, we're fully cognizant of the challenging envi
ronment and 
the need to deliver acceptable returns for our shareholders. That is the 
balance we intend to find at year end.
 
If you take away one thought from my comments today, it should be this. 
We will make the necessary business decisions that need to b
e made to 
ensure that all the changes that have taken place at Morgan Stanley since 
the financial crisis, including reduced leverage, the shift in our business mix 
towards more stable revenue streams, the MUFG conversion and strategic 
alliance, the more th
an doubled liquidity and the elimination or spin off of 
our prop trading businesses, among others, all of these deliver the long
-
term 
shareholder value and performance investors expect.
 
We're delighted with our ongoing partnership with MUFG and I particula
rly 
want to thank them for their support in the past period. We look forward to 
many opportunities to strengthen our relationship in the months, years and 
decades to come.
 
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the incredible hard 
work and re
silience of our employees, the steadfastness of our clients during 
this particularly challenging 6 weeks.
 
Thank you. And now let me turn it over to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, and good morning. I will address 2 broad areas. First, our results 
for the third
 
quarter. Second, I will review our exposures in key geographic 
markets as well as the steps we have taken to ensure we have ample 
liquidity and funding now and in the future. Both topics exemplify the steps 
we have taken during the last 2 years to ensure 
we have prudently risk 
managed the firm, given the ongoing weakness in the global economy.
 
Our firm
-
wide revenues for the third quarter were $9.9 billion, up 7% 
sequentially on a reported basis and down 28% when excluding DVA in each 
period. Revenues were 
$6.5 billion excluding DVA. Given the impact of DVA 
this quarter on our results, I will provide reported numbers but then also 
provide certain amounts, excluding DVA, to help with comparability quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Our noninterest expenses were $6.2 billi
on, down 15% from $7.3 billion last 
quarter. The firm
-
wide compensation ratio was 37% compared to 50% in the 
second quarter. Though excluding the effect of DVA, the ratio was 57% in 
the third quarter versus 52% in the second quarter. Non
-
compensation 
expen
ses were $2.5 billion, down 5% from last quarter. Non
-
compensation 
expenses this quarter included approximately $100 million associated with 
the U.K. bank levy.
 
Overall, for the quarter, income from continuing operations applicable to 
Morgan Stanley was ap
proximately $2.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share 
from continuing operations were $1.14 after preferred dividends. DVA 
positively affected our results by $3.4 billion or approximately $1.12 per 
share. Period
-
end shares outstanding were 1.93 billion, whi
le our diluted 
average shares outstanding were 1.87 billion. Book value at the end of the 
quarter was $31.29 per share, while tangible book value was $27.79 per 
share, both up 4% from last quarter.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $795 billi
on at September 
30, down from $831 billion last quarter, reflecting lower levels of client 
activity and our own tight risk management. This included $180 billion of 
liquidity or 23% of our assets.
 
Although our calculations are not final, we believe that ou
r Tier 1 common 
ratio under Basel I will be approximately 13.1% versus 14.6% in the second 
quarter, and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 15.1% versus 
16.8% in Q2.
 
Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $350 
billio
n at September 30. The increase in our RWAs is not reflective of an 
increase in risk taking but rather a change in a regulatory reporting 
interpretation. Previously, we applied a capital treatment for OTC derivatives 
collateral that reduced our overall RWA
s based on regulatory reporting 
guidance received from the Federal Reserve.
 
This month, we were advised by the Fed that based on their further review 
concerning the application of pre
-
existing regulatory policy, we should adjust 
our capital 
treatment for OTC derivatives collateral. In all circumstances, our 
calculations have been done consistent with Federal Reserve guidance. 
Neither the original capital treatment nor the revision carry through the 
Basel III. And as such, our previously provi
ded estimates for our Tier 1 
common ratio under Basel III currently, and by the end of 2012, are not 
affected.
 
We remain very comfortable under Basel III. We were over 7% as of the end 
of the third quarter, assuming full Basel III inflation of risk
-
weighte
d assets, 
no benefit from mitigation and unfavorable treatment of NCI. In addition, we 
continue to remain comfortable at the high end of the 8% to 10% range we 
have discussed with you for the end of 2012, reflecting passive mitigation 
driven by position ro

off.
 
Now turning to our businesses in detail. First, in Institutional Securities, 
revenues of $6.4 billion were up 24% from last quarter, including the 
positive effect of DVA. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were down 
39% sequentially.
 
Noninterest
 
expenses were $3 billion, down 19% from the second quarter. 
The compensation ratio was 24% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of 
DVA, the ratio was 51%. Non
-
compensation expenses included 
approximately $90 million related to the U.K. bank levy.
 
The busi
ness reported a pretax profit of $3.4 billion. NCI, noncontrolling 
interest, was $60 million for the quarter, primarily attributable to the JV with 
MUFG that we managed.
 
Turning to investment banking. Our activities flowed mid
-
lower market 
volumes due to i
ncreased market volatility and heightened concerns about 
global growth with revenues of $864 million, down 41% from the second 
quarter on lower revenues in each major category.
 
At the end of the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, Morgan 
Stanley r
anked #1 in global completed M&A, #2 in global announced M&A 
and #2 in both global equity and global IPOs, increasing our rank in global 
equities. Notable transactions included Texas Instruments' $7 billion 
acquisition of National Semiconductor; Capital On
e's $2 billion follow
-
on 
equity offering; and Temasek's $3.6 billion sale of equity stakes in both Bank 
of China and China Construction Bank. Advisory revenues of $413 million 
were down 23% sequentially, driven by decreased revenues in the Americas, 
offset
ting higher results in EMEA.
 
Equity underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 43% over the second 
quarter, driven particularly by lower activity in Europe. Fixed income 
underwriting revenues of $212 million decreased 59% from last quarter, 
results prim
arily reflected lower high
-
yield issuance and loan syndication 
activity.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues of $2 billion included positive DVA of $620 
million and were up 6% versus last quarter and 112% from last year. 
Excluding DVA, revenues declined 26% 
sequentially but were up 20% from a 
year ago.
 
In the third quarter, the market was characterized by high volatility, high 
trading volumes and a generally challenging environment for our clients. 
Against this backdrop, our client flows outpaced a strong sec
ond quarter and 
were up double digit year
-
on
-
year. We gained share in cash markets globally 
versus last year.
 
Significant growth in our derivatives and electronic trading client revenues 
partially offset seasonality in our European business and the effects
 
of a 
relatively difficult trading environment.
 
Prime brokerage revenues were down modestly on a sequential basis driven 
by deleveraging and lower markets, although the number of clients was up. 
Year
-
over
-
year, revenues and balances were both up double dig
its.
 
It was recently announced that we took the top spot on the inaugural II All
-
America Sales Team survey. Additionally, we moved from sixth to third on a 
commission
-
weighted basis in the 2011 II All
-
America Research survey.
 
Fixed income and commodities s
ales and trading revenues at $3.9 billion 
included positive DVA of $2.8 billion. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 
43% versus last quarter and 17% versus a year ago. In aggregate, our fixed 
income business delivered in a number of our focused areas against
 
the 
backdrop of a very challenging environment. The commitment to our rate 
franchise is yielding positive results with revenues up both sequentially and 
year
-
over
-
year, driven by greater client activity.
 
We continue to see increased share in FX products o
n higher volume. Our 
commodities business turned in a strong performance on improve client 
flow. The relative weakness was in credit and mortgage revenues, 2 areas of 
historic strength for us. Lower results versus last quarter and last year 
reflect wider s
preads arising from illiquidity and challenging market 
condition. Results in the fixed income business also included $284 million in 
losses related to monolines.
 
Surveys from Greenwich Associates indicate that we gained more fixed 
income volume shares than
 
any other dealer over the last year, ranking 
fourth overall with 6.6 market share versus 4.9 last year, with 
improvements across geographies and products. The other sales and trading 
line reflects negative revenues of $443 million.
 
Turning to VAR. Average
 
VAR decreased from $145 million in the second 
quarter to $130 million this quarter. As I pointed out previously, we report 
VAR based on a 4
-
year data series, which includes the 2007 and 2008 crisis 
period. To provide better transparency on the components 
of VAR, in our 
supplement this quarter, we have separately set out credit portfolio VAR to 
provide VAR both including and excluding Credit Portfolio VAR, which reflects 
counterparty spread volatility as well as our relationship lending portfolio 
and hedges
.
 
We believe this presents a clearer view of the components driving our VAR 
that are isolating the risk decisions we are making to date at the trading 
level. As you can see in the supplement, our average aggregated VAR by 
primary risk category for the quar
ter was $93 million versus $135 million in 
the second quarter.
 
The Global Wealth Management segment demonstrated revenue stability in 
the face of challenging market conditions, one of the benefits of MSSB that 
we have highlighted previously. In a seasonall
y slow period, revenues of 
$3.3 billion were down 6% from the prior quarter, but up 5% versus the 
prior year. Asset Management revenues are primarily driven by asset levels 
at the beginning of the period and were thus roughly flat with second 
quarter level
s and well above the year ago period. The other revenue line 
decreased on pure gains from sales from our investment portfolio. GWM's 
investment banking
-
related fees fell 26% sequentially as new issue 
underwriting volumes fell during the quarter. Trading an
d commissions were 
lower versus the second quarter, reflecting the market's impact on 
investments related to the firm deferred compensation and co
-
investment 
plan, though commissions were up substantially versus the third quarter of 
last year.
 
Noninterest 
expenses were $2.9 billion, down 8% from last quarter. The 
compensation ratio of 61% in the quarter continued to be driven primarily by 
the formulaic grid payout and business mix. Non
-
compensation expenses 
were $896 million down from $1 billion in the seco
nd quarter. The FDIC 
assessment included in expenses was approximately $30 million lower than 
our expectation this quarter, all associated with the FDIC assessment related 
to Citi's depositories. FDIC fees should normalize in the fourth quarter.
 
Integratio
n costs were approximately $90 million in the quarter. Profit before 
tax was $362 million and the PBT margin was 11%. NCI for the quarter was 
$52 million, up from $4 million in the second quarter. Total client assets 
moved slightly lower to $1.6 trillion d
ue to lower market levels, despite the 
highest net asset inflow since the JV's inception at $15.5 billion in the 
quarter. Net fee
-
based asset flows were $10.1 billion, contributing to the 
growth in fee
-
based assets under management to $465 billion at quart
er 
end, up 6% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Year
-
to
-
date, net fee
-
based asset inflows were $37.6 billion, an important 
factor in the stability of our revenue stream. FA's at quarter end were 
17,291, down just over 300 sequentially, in line with our prior comments on 
FA 
headcount. Turnover in our top 2 quintiles was the lowest since the 
inception of the joint venture. Bank deposits were roughly flat with last 
quarter at $109 billion.
 
Turning to Asset Management. We continue to make progress and take the 
appropriate steps 
in rebuilding our business and saw strong performance 
versus benchmarks in the traditional side of the business. Results were 
lower, primarily on markdowns in merchant banking and real estate funds 
due to declines in global markets. In Traditional Asset Ma
nagement, 
revenues decreased 20% from the second quarter to $292 million, driven by 
lower average AUM as well as a reduction in principal transactions due to 
markdowns on investments associated with deferred compensation plan. In 
Real Estate Investing, rev
enues of $61 million were lower on markdowns 
this quarter.
 
Given the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of the 
markdowns are passed to third
-
party investors in the noncontrolling interest 
line.
 
In Merchant Banking, negative revenues of $138 m
illion compared to 
positive revenues of $104 million in the previous quarter, driven by 
markdowns in private equity, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. 
Compensation expense was $133 million in the quarter, down from $285 
million in the second quarter
, driven by lower deferred comp plan expenses. 
Losses before taxes were $117 million. NCI was negative $18 million versus 
positive $92 million last quarter, reflecting the markdowns in consolidated 
real estate funds versus markups in 2Q.
 
Total AUM decrease
d 9% sequentially to $268 billion, driven by market 
depreciation and net asset outflows of $5.8 billion. As of August 2011, over 
76% of our long
-
term strategies continued to outperform their respective 
benchmarks on a 3
-
, 5
-
 
and 10
-
year basis.
 
In addition 
to operating results, we have made progress in our office of 
reengineering, and we are thus taking up the expected savings from our 3
-
year program. We previously expected slightly more than $1 billion in 
aggregate run rate savings during the next 3 years, 
but now expect that 
figure to grow to $1.4 billion, net of cost to implement the savings with the 
possibility for further upside as we continue to make progress.
 
These savings come from initiatives that address headcount compensation 
and non
-
compensation e
xpenses, most notably with technology costs, 
procurement efficiency and location strategy.
 
Now turning to my second topic, prudent management of the franchise. 
First, we have been focused on carefully managing risk in both peripheral 
and core Europe for 
the last 2 years. As you can see on Page 13 of our 
supplement, we've summarized our exposure for the peripherals and France. 
The schedule captures exposure to sovereign, financials, corporate and 
clearinghouses.
 
Starting at the far right, we have provided 
our net funded exposure. We 
have then identified all hedges to get you to exposure consistent with the 
way we described it last quarter. We then provided you with the 4 
components of our exposure. First, the CDS adjustment, which refers to 
credit protectio
n purchased from the region on the region or from France on 
France. Second, we included funded lending. Third, net counterparty 
exposure, which includes repose and securities lending, which are both by 
definition a matchbook, and OTC derivative, which are 
subject to any master 
netting agreements as well as cash collateral. Fourth, is net inventory, which 
reflects netting of our short and long and single name positions. Our 
exposure excludes deposits and unfunded loans.
 
To be clear, for the periphery, our ne
t exposure is $2.1 billion, and excluding 
the benefit of hedges is $5.7 billion. This approach is consistent with the 
approach we reviewed last quarter.
 
I'd also like to bring your attention to Italy, which as you can see in the 
exhibit, represents about 8
5% of our exposure to the region and is 
predominantly to the sovereign. Using the same approach with France, at 
September 30, net exposure was less than 0, and excluding hedges, the 
total was $1.5 billion. Approximately $1 billion of that amount includes o
ur 
guarantee fund contribution and initial margin at a clearinghouse. Excluding 
the clearinghouse amount, we get to approximately $500 million.
 
Let me turn to what is being called FFIEC data. As many of you know and 
have written about, FFIEC Regulatory dat
a present notional amounts 
outstanding in a country rather than providing a real measure of risk. In 
essence, the FFIEC data are reported on some combination of notional and 
growth asset basis and do not reflect the liability side of the balance sheet, 
and
 
thus do not reflect offset for short positions or collateral. For example, 
reversed repo positions are reported growth with no deduction of collateral. 
In some cases, OTC derivatives are presented on a notional basis. And in 
addition, they are presented w
ithout the netting of collateral or without the 
benefit of offsetting trades that may have occurred in a different jurisdiction.
 
In certain countries, the FFIEC data are particularly not reflective of risk 
exposure because the data include all volumes that
 
go through a central 
clearinghouse that is located in that country. It does capture transactions 
taking place outside of a country.
 
I'll share with you a couple of items in our June data for France so you can 
get a sense for how it differs from what we wo
uld consider risk. 20% to 25% 
of the FFIEC amount is a gross up of derivatives between fair value and 
notional. Approximately 55% of the amount reflects reverse repos through a 
French subsidiary of LCH Clearnet where we clear our reverse repos as well 
as o
ther cash and collateral.
 
Let me now address what we are doing to risk manage liquidity and funding. 
You've heard us say how focused we have been since the autumn of 2008 on 
diversifying the entirety of our funding mix, staying ahead of maturities and 
exte
nding WAM to enhance durability and optimize funding requirements. 
With respect to funding, we raised $7.5 billion in the third quarter and $30.5 
billion of unsecured funding year
-
to
-
date, thereby prefunding much of our 
upcoming requirements.
 
We plan to ac
cess the vanilla debt markets only on an opportunistic basis for 
the following reasons. Our balance sheet is down from an average of $875 
billion in Q2 to $849 billion in Q3, and we are focused on both sides and 
composition. In addition, as I have often di
scussed, we have significantly 
increased our liquidity pool over the last several years, in particular, in 
relation to the size of our balance sheet building a valuable buffer. Our 
liquidity averaged $138 billion in 2008, which we increased to $154 billion
 
in 
2009 and $159 billion in 2010.
 
Since the start of this year, we have further grown the reserve from about 
$170 billion to $180 billion at the end of the third quarter. The liquidity 
reserve remains strong, notwithstanding the fact that during the third
 
quarter, we opportunistically bought back approximately $2 billion of our 
own debt in the open market in addition to retiring $4 billion of our 
maturities.
 
The larger liquidity reserve enhances our funding flexibility during ongoing 
market volatility. In 
addition, as I discussed at a recent conference, a key 
input in the sizing of the liquidity reserve is our rolling forward 12
-
month 
maturity. We reached the high point last month, and the rolling forward 12
-
month maturities will decline by approximately $1
0 billion in the first quarter 
of 2012, providing us with the ability to use some of the liquidity reserve 
while maintaining the same liquidity position versus our maturities.
 
The 2 examples I've given, exposures and liquidity management, are 
consistent wi
th the very deliberate, prudent approach to managing the firm 
that we have repeatedly discussed and is evidenced by our leverage down 
from 32x in 3Q '07 to 13x at the end of the quarter; balance sheet, down 
from $1.1 trillion to $795 billion; and capital, 
substantially enhanced, in 
particular with the conversion of MUFGs preferred into common, cementing 
our decades
-
long relationship.
 
Let me close by turning to our outlook. Like everyone else, we remain 
concerned about growth prospects in both the U.S. and E
urope, particularly 
because the path to growth depends heavily on choices made by 
policymakers and their ability to execute. Our pipelines remain healthy, but 
the ability to execute transactions is clearly affected by volatility in markets. 
With the move w
e have made during the last several years with respect to 
our business mix, capital and liquidity, we are confident in our foundation 
and our focus on optimally allocating resources to enhance returns firm
-
wide 
and best deliver for shareholders and clients
.
 
Thank you. And now James and I will take your questions.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Guy Moszkowski 
with Bank of America.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
I had a qu
estion for you about debt repurchases that I think you did during 
the quarter, maybe you can give us a sense for amounts, timing, how you 
think about that repurchase activity as part of your kind of long
-
term capital 
management plans. Then I have a couple 
of follow
-
ups.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as I noted, the amount, we did buy debt throughout the quarter. In 
particular, as spreads widened, we bought debt towards the end of the 
quarter. We thought it was a profitable, smart move to make. Just for your 
reference, the 
debt buyback is reflected in the other revenues line, just so 
you know where to find it. And I think our view is, again, it's about prudently 
managing the liquidity portfolio. So we were early focused on those 
maturities that, in particular, are caught in 
that 12
-
month period of time, 
but as spreads widened it's just a wise prudent move to make, not just 
continuing to act appropriately as a market maker but the right answer for 
our shareholders. And so I think we'll continue to monitor it and do what's in 
t
he best interest depending on where the market is.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Is it ever possible to include in that debt repurchase significant amounts of 
the structured products that give rise to the DVA? Or have you thought 
a
bout anything else you could try to do to do some 
--
 
put on some hedges 
or something now to try to lock in some of these very significant gains?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, 2 parts to your question. One, we do buyback structured notes. That's 
reflected in the overall
 
debt repurchase number that I gave you. And with 
respect to hedging, we don't hedge DVA, the noncash item, and we don't 
hedge to manage an accounting result. Our view is it's not worth the 
expense and we really run the business based on economics. But we 
do, as 
a regular matter, buy some of it back throughout the year.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Okay, that's fair. Maybe you can 
--
 
I don't know if you've got the numbers 
that you'll use in the Q for the monoline CBA in terms of th
e gross 
counterparty exposure, the CBA adjustments and the counterparty hedges 
there. If you have those at this point, they would be useful.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the monoline number is $284 million. I think I gave that. And that 
obviously, CBA is included in 
monolines, but there's more in that number as 
well.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Okay. Maybe I'll just follow up with you off
-
line just to sort of see if we can 
update the 10
-
Q disclosures without having to wait for those to come 
out. 
And then I guess the final question I have is on GWM. You talked about the 
fact that you had $90 million of the restructuring costs still in there and yet 
it certainly looks like you're capturing some significant reductions in costs, 
especially on the
 
non
-
personnel side, relative to what we've seen. Are we 
starting to see some benefit from moving on to the new systems and being 
able to stop supporting some of the legacy stuff? Or is that something else 
going on?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We are pleased with the progr
ess on the integration, having completed the 
platform, moved to Morgan Stanley FAs onto the platform and the success 
we have with it and benefits has been another way. We're able to move the 
Smith Barney FAs on to that platform earlier next year than we ha
ve 
previously anticipated, which is helpful. Part of the margin benefit this 
quarter, as I noted, came from the lower FDIC fee than we had previously 
expected coming from the Citi side. But very much to your question, Greg 
Fleming is very focused on expens
e 
--
 
disciplined expense management. And 
that is a core part of what he's continuing to focus on with the team. It's 
reflected in a number of different ways, but one example that I gave was the 
reduction in FAs. And what he's focused on is reducing the low
er
-
productivity 
FAs, and that brings with it some incremental cost savings as well. So yes, 
the core part is expense discipline.
 
Guy Moszkowski

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
And let me ask a capital management question finally, that kind of ties 
in 
with MSSB as well. Obviously, you have approval from the Fed to purchase 
Citi's remaining stake in the JV. And your current capital ratios are all 
certainly very strong in all the relevant measures, but your stock is so 
cheap. I just wonder what's your 
strategic attachment to moving forward 
with the MSSB timetable for repurchase relative to using some of your 
excess capital and liquidity just buying the shares here.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Guy, it's James. The strategic intent is pretty clear. We want to intend 
to 
own this business. But timing of executing on that is flexible. And we built in 
that flexibility when we negotiated the initial deal with Citigroup. Whereas 
you may recall, it's in 3 stages beginning in May of 2012. And it is an open
-
ended call option w
here we have the right at that point to exercise the first, 
next May, first 14% but not the obligation to do it at that point in time. 
We're obviously aware of where the stock is trading right now. It certainly 
feels a little better than it did 2 weeks ago
, but it's not where we think it 
should be. And it's something that we'll take into consideration. But May is a 
long way off, and we've got to be careful not to mix long
-
term strategy with 
short
-
term tactical optimization.
 
Guy Moszkowski

BofA Merrill Lyn

So it sounds like you'll make game time calls as necessary.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Absolutely.

The next question will come from Howard Chen with Crédit Suisse.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
All of what you say on
 
funding, risk exposures, liquidity makes a lot of 
sense. But whether it's a result of market rumors or not, I guess the reality 
of the situation is the CBS spreads widened during the quarter. So other 
than DVA and the opportunity to buy back debt, I mean,
 
how exactly does 
that widening impact to 
--
 
what all you have to do on a day
-
to
-
day basis and 
in the client
-
facing business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
When CDS in particular widened, it's clearly frustrating when we look at 
what we were seeing in the number of liquidity
, the exposures. What it did 
result in is a lot of what I think it's fair to characterize as very productive 
conversations with clients. We're able to talk about the changes we made 
that James really opened with the business mix, the approach to liquidity,
 
funding, capital. How we fund the firm, fundamentally different than it was 
years ago. And that was, I think, quite productive. I made comments with 
respect to how we think about funding the business. Our view is that we've 
seen a bit of moderation here i
n spreads. And hopefully, with the 
incremental information, that will be helpful as well. But we're certainly 
thinking about all options and have a lot of flexibility.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay, great. And just a follow
-
up to t
hat, can you specifically discuss what, 
if any, movements you had in the prime brokerage balances during the 
quarter and maybe how much additional collateral you may have had to post 
in some of the over
-
the
-
counter transactions, again, if you see any 
meani
ngful changes in there.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, the simple answer is we didn't see any meaningful changes. In the 
third quarter, as I noted, PB was one of the better performing businesses in 
equities, that we did see an increase in the number of clients. And as w
e 
moved into the fourth quarter, we had some balances move out. We had 
some move in. Where they were moved, they were more likely partial than 
more than that, and the business remains very strong. It really did benefit 
from the changes over the last severa
l years, the focus on relationship 
management, the focus on really working with clients across the platform, 
this topic of benefiting from adjacencies and institutional equities. So we 
really didn't see a meaningful change. A lot more conversations but not
 
substance change.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay. And then just returning to the monoline exposure, James. You've done 
a good job of leading the charge to clean up legacy issues of the firm and 
noted your desire to kind of achieve 
acceptable returns over time. So I'm 
just curious what's the feasibility and appetite to effectively remove this 
overhang once and for all, free up the risk capital, lessen the volatility in the 
earnings stream, is that doable?
 
James P. Gorman
 
I think you'
ve got to play this out over time. I think we've managed 
--
 
Kenny and the team have managed the exposure much more aggressively 
over the last 12 months. And I think the results show that. We had a 
positive return in the first half of the year. We had a def
icit in the last 
quarter. But we've got to manage this over time. There's a lot of complexity 
around the exposure, and it's not something that we are chomping at the bit 
to have results tomorrow.

The next question will come from Glenn Schorr 
with Nomura.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
So you've spoken loud and clear on liquidity rising, PB actually not affected, 
the number of clients actually went up. Just curious, finishing off on the 
hoopla on the quarter, were 
there many novations away in the quarter? It 
sounds like you defended the fort great, just figured I'd ask.
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. Simple answer.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
On the liquidity front, and we have some upcoming debt ma
turities, but 
obviously you have lots of liquidity to handle that. What's the right 
--
 
how do 
you strike the balance? What's the right long
-
term average maturity or 
duration of the debt outstanding? It's come down over the last couple of 
years to about 5 y
ears and I didn't know how you strike the balance. Maybe 
that's in response to the balance sheet coming down.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, the reason I gave the roll forward is I think one of the critical elements 
in sizing a liquidity reserve is whether the likely ou
tflows in a stressed 
environment 
--
 
one of the clear outflows that we can measure is what are 
upcoming maturities over the next 12 months. And the fact that maturities 
are coming down indicates that with the current liquidity reserve, if you roll 
forward t
o the first quarter and your outflows from that point on are $10 
billion lower, you have flexibility within your liquidity pool. So we ended the 
quarter at $180 billion. We're sitting there today at $180 billion. That gives 
us a very nice liquidity pool go
ing into the fourth quarter, in particular as our 
near
-
term outflows are declining because we're really knocking off the 
maturities as we go through the balance of 
--
 
because we have reserve for 
all of 2012 at this point. So that's probably one of the most
 
important ways 
to think about how do you size liquidity reserve. I think as it relates to WAM, 
long
-
term debt WAM, it's generally in the same area. And we're trying to 
manage what we think is a prudent level. And as I've said also, when we 
look at what we
're doing in the secured book, I think we were early and 
quite aggressive and thoughtful in pushing out WAM in the secured book and 
have continued to have that extension of WAM serving as well with the 
durability you've seen in liquidity.

In FFIEC, if you add in all your comments on both DVA from both quarters 
and the MBIA gain and loss, it looks like FFIEC was only down about 4% 
quarter on quarter, just want to see if I did the math right. And th
en just 
curious on what got better since Barclays because something clearly got 
better.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we did see greater stirrings coming into the latter half of September. I 
think the strong areas I've highlighted, rates in particular, performed very 
well
. And I would say commodities was strong in particular as we went 
through the balance of September, and up nicely, granted off of a weak 
second quarter, but a strong performance. The tough area continues to be 
credit. Although I think there was some modera
tion there as well.

Great. Last very simple one. You mentioned the cost saves projections going 
up net of the cost to implement. How big are we looking on the cost to 
implement?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We hav
en't broken that out separately. But the way to think about is in 2011 
we're not indicating any savings. And the reason is we're really investing or 
spending what we need to do in order to make some of the moves, in 
particular in technology and location so
urcing that will then yield benefit 3 
years out.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
 
Michael Mayo

Credit Agricole Securities (

Question related to 
FFIEC. I guess there are a couple of hung deals during 
the quarter in the syndicated loan market or leveraged loans, Kinetic 
Concepts and Blackboard. Just in aggregate, how much were the write
-
downs on the leveraged loans that were on your books?
 
Ruth Pora
t
 
Well, the write
-
downs were about 400.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (

So all things equal, that should go away if the market stays stable?
 
Ruth Porat
 
If the 
markets stay stable, it should. I mean, obviously we're mark
-
to
-
market. I think when we look at the loans, and in particular the ability to 
move loans through 
--
 
that the thing that we point to is that the loans have 
been very well structured with covenant
s and pricing flex that give us the 
ability to move some of this.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc., Research 
Division
 
And do you have any other sizable negative 
mark
-
to
-
market adjustments in 
FFIEC. And if so, which businesses?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. As I indicated, the tough market across the board was in credit. But no 
there's nothing else to raise.
 
Michael Mayo

Credit Agricole Securities (

And as far as the outlook in the leveraged loan market, there's been a little 
bit more noise about some issues in some high
-
profile companies. Have you 
pulled back there? Or can you consider those one
-
off
 
events?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Industry
-
wide, you saw volumes were down meaningfully in the third 
quarter. And I think really what we're seeing at this point is financial sponsor 
activity is also down quite a bit. As we look at the M&A pipeline, it's strong, 
it's ver
y healthy, but not seeing real preponderance or the growth in sponsor 
activity. And so at this point what we're focused on is leveraged loans in the 
pipeline and ongoing syndication. And as I indicated with pricing flex, we 
have the ability, in our view, t
o execute on this.
 
Michael Mayo

Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc., Research 
Division
 
And then lastly, just your outlook for the fourth quarter. With the way the 
markets have been, should we expect s
omething similar to this quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The wild card, as I indicated, continues to be the macro environment. So the 
pipeline in banking overall is healthy. I just commented on M&A. The equity 
pipeline continues to build. And our view is that with som
e moderation in the 
VIX, we should start to see more of those deals working their way out of the 
pipeline and into execution. And the benefit is not just within banking but 
clearly goes to the secondary trading, also goes through the Morgan Stanley 
Smith B
arney. So that's going to be an important driver and hard to 
forecast. What we're seeing though, healthy volumes on the banking side. 
And I think a lot of the real challenge in credit, but hopefully it starts to 
moderate given how tough it really was the l
evels at which we're currently 
operating. So if you can give me the outlook for the macro, I could answer 
your question more directly.

If I can squeeze one more in. The compensation ratio seems a bit higher 
than some of your peers, probably a lot higher than you'd like. Is that 
because you gave some guarantees to new traders or what's happening 
there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Definitely not because 
of guarantees. Year
-
to
-
date 
--
 
just let me break it 
down. First of all, obviously the firm compensation ratio is affected by the 
compensation ratio in MSSB, which is as you know, formulaic running at 
60% plus. And so that's one important differentiation fr
om other firms. 
Within ISG, excluding DVA, it was at 51% this quarter. That brings us to 
about 46% year
-
to
-
date. And what we're continuing to be focused on is 
ensuring that we can appropriately compensate those that are delivering 
returns for the franchise
 
while balancing with what we need to do to deliver 
returns for shareholders. So it's a balancing act but I did want to at least 
catch you up on the year
-
to
-
date 46%, give you a sense that the third 
quarter had a bit of a catch up in it.
 
Operator
 
The next 
question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Quick question on equities. You guys highlighted high levels of client activity. 
But if we x out that DVA revenues were down a bit quarter
-
over
-
quarter, 
just 
trying to get a sense for what the right flow level is there? Was there 
some noise in the last quarter that maybe we should be looking through as 
far as maybe some benefit from positioning? Or can you help me kind of get 
my head around that one?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Certainly. So the performance was off of a record second quarter. There are, 
I think, probably 2 items to highlight. One is that a lot of the activity this 
quarter went through the electronic trading platform, or MSET electronic 
trading platform, which is
 
a terrific asset but it tends to be lower margin 
revenue than broadly in our cash equities business. So that's one driver to 
where is that revenue coming from. The second, as I noted, is that the 
second quarter tends to be seasonally strong in Europe on a
n annual basis. 
And so we were 
--
 
we knew that coming off of the second quarter, we had 
that strength in the second quarter that wasn't going to flow through to the 
third quarter. That was well offset in certain regards with the strength in 
derivatives and
 
cash equities and PB. But it did create 
--
 
it explains some of 
the difference.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Yes, tough comp, okay. And then just quickly on peripheral European 
exposure, the table is great. Thanks for that. Is it
 
possible maybe for you to 
give us an idea of the impact of collateral on the net counterparty exposure 
column that you've got in there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the net counterparty exposure line, as I indicated, captures a number of 
different things like repo trans
actions. So it's really running a matchbook, 
and so we haven't broken that out.
 
Operator
 
The final question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
A lot has been covered here. I guess on 
VAR, I wanted to ask you the 
interest rate VAR came down, I guess that was an average basis. I guess 
one question, do you have the end of quarter VAR? Was it any different? And 
b, just want to kind of square that with the market share gains that 
--
 
it 
soun
ds like you continue to make in the third quarter or just the activity 
levels were a lot higher so there was less capital commitment required that 
brought the VAR down?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So overall, the 
--
 
if you follow with IR, I think we have all the breakdown 
of 
the various categories, which I don't have in front of me. I think the main 
point, VAR did come down because we saw starting mid
-
June client activity 
really coming down. And I think this line item, which I found helpful 
hopefully, is for you to break ou
t credit portfolio VAR, just focus on where 
we're making risk decisions today, really punctuates the point about the 
extent to which risk is lower this quarter than it has been actually in quite 
some time.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Divi
sion
 
Okay, yes 
--
 
no, I was asking about the interest rate VAR. In that table in 
the back that came down. That kind of stood out given the increased 
commitment you've been making in that business.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Right. And that, I think that really goes to it'
s very much of a flow business 
and so you don't see as much VAR utilized there.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Got it, okay. The debt that you repurchased during the quarter, what was 
the 
--
 
can you say what the gain was on that?
 
Ru
th Porat
 
It was less than $100 million in the P&L.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay. And are you blocked out like companies are with stock repurchases 
around earnings or I think can you buy debt any time?
 
Ruth Porat
 
On debt repur
chases there's a window when you're blocked out, so we 
bought not all the way through the quarter because there was a bit of a 
block out again.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay. So there probably wouldn't have been an opportunity
 
to buy yet this 
quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, I think it's 2 weeks on either side.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Got it, okay. Just I guess, I know there is not a lot to really answer on 
Volcker, but as you look at 
--
 
to whatever extent
 
you look at the draft yet, 
did anything 
--
 
or what stood out as surprising relative to what you expected 
to see from discussions that you've had with the regulators in the preceding 
months?
 
James P. Gorman
 
What stood out to me was that a simple propositio
n of ensuring that 
depositor institutions don't take on aggressive proprietary trading was 
converted into 290 pages with an additional 394 comments, questions 
asking for commentary, some of which have multiple parts to them. I'm not 
criticizing the regulat
ors, this is very a complex thing they're trying to find 
and fortunately they've opened up a healthy, I think, it's 5 to 6 months for 
the industry to weigh in with directive and providing a list of all of the 
questions that they felt needed addressed. Ever
ybody, maybe not 
everybody, I think most sensible people are trying to get to a sensible 
outcome, which is to protect deposits from the kind of natural crisis we had, 
but not lose any of the robust liquidity strength of the global capital markets. 
So we've
 
got 6 months to work on it and work on it we will.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Is it your sense, James, that there's a lot kind of thrown in here to, because 
they've asked a lot of questions that they want to put more rather tha
n less 
in there and have a full template to work off of?
 
James P. Gorman
 
I think it's a reflection of this is a very complex set of changes that 
potentially going through, and they want to be very careful to make sure 
they get real input from all the marke
t participants to make sure we don't 
somehow mess this up.

10/17/18,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Celeste Mellet Brown, Head of Investor Relations at 
Morgan Stanley. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call.
 
Today's presentation may include forward

looking statements, which reflect 
management's current estimates or 
beliefs and are subject to risks and 
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The 
presentation may also include certain non

GAAP financial measures. Please 
see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such 
n

GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of 
additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of 
Morgan Stanley.
 
This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be

any security or instrument.
 
I will now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everybody. Before handing the call 
over 
to Ruth, I just want to make a few comments about our performance this 
quarter and importantly, how that balances our strategic direction. Speaking 
that we've just completed a Board meeting in Tokyo with our partners, 
MUFG, and I'm pleased I was able 
to make it back in time to join this call.
 
When I became CEO about 18 months ago, I had a list of 10 or so important 
steps that we felt needed to be achieved in order to restore Morgan Stanley 
to the strong financial position we have enjoyed so much by his
tory. Chief 
among those were enhancing the already
-
strong performance and client 
focus of our Equities, Banking and Capital Markets businesses; improving 
share and performance in fixed income; successfully integrating MSSB while 
growing assets, revenues an
d margins; derisking Asset Management to 
focus on our core institutional and merchant banking activities and then 
growing from that base; selling or shutting down the pure proprietary 
businesses that we had pre
-
crisis; resolving legacy balance sheet issues
; 
increasing our liquidity; and importantly, achieving an early conversion of 
the MUFG
-
preferred security with the 10% coupon.
 
Our progress has, at times, been uneven over the past 6 quarters, and the 
shifting regulatory landscape has made it challenging t
o anticipate required 
capital and liquidity levels. Our single
-
minded focus has been to drive 
forward against these goals and in so doing, shorten the list.
 
In a moment Ruth will walk through the segment results, but let me touch 
on a few key items. Equiti
es, Banking, Capital Markets are in great shape. 
The results reflect it, and we have achieved several high
-
water marks this 
quarter. In fixed income, despite a very complicated challenging market, our 
teams delivered solid performance and we are improving 
client connectivity, 
and the results demonstrate it. In GWM, revenues, flows and assets were all 
strong. However, we remain very focused on expenses in this business. 
Margins must improve and do so soon.
 
Finally, the MUFG conversion has received relatively
 
modest attention, but in 
our view, was a breakthrough from Morgan Stanley. By converting the 
security at the cost of 75 million shares or approximately $1.7 billion, we 
have permanently removed a $780 million annual drag on our earnings while 
simultaneous
ly increasing Tier 1 common by approximately $8 billion.
 
Just as importantly, we have enhanced the alignment with our Japanese 
partner. The most recent evidence of which was taking our whole Board to 
Tokyo to meet with them. By them now applying equity acc
ounting to our 
earnings, MUFG prospers when Morgan Stanley prospers. Thus, we have 
great incentives to combine our resources and client contacts to drive 
incremental results and leverage both balance sheets, including the joint 
commitment of $30 billion in
 
our global lending joint venture since inception.
 
These are unquestionably challenging markets, but our focus is and must be 
on methodical and resolute forward progress, with an ever
-
increasing eye on 
those things which we do control, in particular drivin
g greater penetration 
with our clients while leveraging our global platform, as well as stringent 
cost management, including the firm
-
wide expense reengineering program 
Ruth discussed extensively at the recent conference and will discuss, no 
doubt, more th
rough the course of this call.
 
Let me turn it back to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, and good morning.
 
Our firm
-
wide revenues for the second quarter were $9.3 billion, up 22% 
sequentially on a reported basis and up 7% when excluding DVA in each 
period and the
 
MUMSS
-
related loss last quarter. Results also reflected gains 
related to monolines in the quarter versus losses in the first quarter of 2011.
 
Our noninterest expenses were $7.3 billion, up from $6.8 billion last quarter. 
The firm
-
wide compensation ratio w
as 50% compared to 57% in the first 
quarter. So excluding the impact of DVA and the MUMSS lost last quarter, 
the ratio was 52% in the second quarter versus 51% in the first quarter.
 
Non
-
compensation expenses were $2.7 billion, up 10% from last quarter. 
Non
-
compensation expenses this quarter included $130 million associated 
with our joint venture with Huaxin Securities in China as well as about $45 
million in higher FDIC fees in Global Wealth Management that I alluded to 
last quarter.
 
Overall for the quarter
, income from continuing operations applicable to 
Morgan Stanley was approximately $1.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share 
was a loss of $0.38 after preferred dividends. That is attributable to a 
noncash charge of approximately $1.7 billion related to the
 
conversion of 
MUFG
-
preferred into common reflected in the preferred dividends line. This 
translated to a $1.02 per share negative impact to diluted earnings per 
share for the quarter. The charge was partially offset by savings of $196 
million in preferred
 
dividends due to the earlier
-
than
-
expected conversion. 
DVA positively impacted results by $244 million.
 
Period
-
end shares outstanding were 1.93 billion, while our diluted average 
shares outstanding were 1.46 billion. Excluding the charge, EPS would have 
b
een calculated on an if
-
converted basis because of the earnings level in the 
quarter. Diluted average shares outstanding underlying the if
-
converted 
method were $1.79 billion, which is what the calculation of the charge is 
based on in our press release.
 
We
 
are very pleased to have closed the conversion, which puts the firm in a 
robust Tier 1 common position. Our partner, MUFG, now owns more than 
22% of our shares outstanding. And pursuant to the conversion agreement, 
MUFG now holds 2 seats on Board, subject
 
to conditions of the agreement.
 
In addition to MUFG converting its preferred, MUMSS has been working 
through a strategic risk management review and remediation program and 
has changed its leadership and process controls. As we previously 
announced, MUFG i
ncreased the capital in a joint venture during the quarter, 
$86 million of which accrues to Morgan Stanley equity and book value.
 
Book value at the end of the quarter was $30.17 per share, while tangible 
book value was $26.61 per share. The changes in book
 
value and tangible 
book value reflect the benefit of net income earned in the quarter as well as 
the impact of the MUFG conversion.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $831 billion at June 30, 
which included $182 billion of liquidity or 22% of
 
our assets and reflects our 
enhanced approach to secured funding including extending WAM, investor 
diversification and strong governance. Although our calculations are not 
final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be 
approximately 
14.6%, up from 11.7% in the first quarter, and our Tier 1 
capital ratio will be approximately 16.8% versus 16.5% in the first quarter. 
Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $304 
billion at June 30.
 
Now turning to our businesse
s in detail. First in Institutional Securities, 
revenues of $5.2 billion were up 44% from last quarter and included the 
positive impact of DVA. Noninterest expenses were $3.7 billion, up 17% 
from the first quarter. The compensation ratio was 43% in the qua
rter. 
Excluding the impact of DVA, the ratio was 45%. Non
-
compensation 
expenses increased over the first quarter, largely due to the expenses 
associated with our new China joint venture I mentioned previously. The 
business reported a pretax profit of $1.5 
billion. NCI, or non
-
controlling 
interest, was $117 million for the quarter, primarily attributable to our joint 
venture with MUFG.
 
Turning to Investment Banking. Our activity remained robust with revenues 
of $1.5 billion, up 46% from the first quarter on 
higher revenues across the 
board, M&A, equity and fixed income underwriting, and up 66% from a year 
ago. We generated our highest M&A revenue quarter since 2007 and our 
strongest reported quarter ever for the firm in fixed income underwriting. At 
the end o
f the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, Morgan 
Stanley ranked first in global completed M&A, second in global announced 
M&A and second in both global equity and global IPOs. We led significant 
deals including 4 of the top 5 transactions in glob
al completed M&A.
 
Notable transactions in banking included Marathon Oil's $15.2 billion spin
-
off 
of Marathon petroleum, the 22.4 billion merger of VimpelCom and Weather 
Investments in Italy, Glencore International's $10 billion IPO and Chrysler's 
$3.2 bill
ion high
-
yield issuance. Advisory revenues of $533 million were up 
38% sequentially, driven by a significant increase in America's revenues, 
partially offset by lower results in EMEA. Equity underwriting revenues were 
$419 million, up 47% over the first qu
arter.
 
Results were healthy across regions with particular strength in Europe, which 
saw increased activity in both IPOs and rights issues as well as higher Asian 
activity centered around large Hong Kong and China IPOs. Activity was also 
diversified across
 
sectors with particular strength in technology, financials 
and materials. Fixed income underwriting revenues of $521 million increased 
54% from last quarter. Results were driven by an increase in acquisition's 
enhanced activity in both the investment
-
grad
e and noninvestment
-
grade 
markets.
 
Equity sales and trading delivered its highest revenue since the financial 
crisis at $1.85 billion, including positive DVA of $52 million, driven by a focus 
on clients and continued share gains. Excluding DVA, we generated a 
sequential revenue increase of 
4% with 40% growth from a year ago on 
market share gains in cash equities, client derivatives activity as well as 
continued strength in financing products, notwithstanding lower market 
volumes and an increasingly challenging environment for investors. Prim
e 
brokerage revenues were up significantly sequentially and double
-
digit year
-
over
-
year, while client balances continue to grow modestly.
 
Derivatives revenues were down from their highest results in the first 
quarter due to lower volatility levels, partial
ly offset by higher client volume. 
Year
-
over
-
year, equity derivative revenues were up significantly.
 
Growth in our electronic trading businesses continued to outpace the 
market. And our ongoing commitment to sustaining a world
-
class research 
product, along
side our potent sales and trading business, continues to yield 
strong results in independent surveys. Our efforts to balance institutional 
equities performance across products and regions has resulted in greater 
earnings stability even in challenging marke
ts, a primary objective for all of 
our major businesses.
 
Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues of $2.1 billion 
included positive DVA of $192 million. Fixed income markets during the 
quarter were difficult and especially so in commodities,
 
which experienced 
very significant and material declines on lower client activity across the 
sector. In aggregate, our fixed income business outside of commodities and 
excluding MBA, evidence the ongoing progress we are making. For example, 
results of rec
ent surveys from Greenwich Associates and Orion Consultants 
indicate that our market penetration across fixed income is growing, while 
our service levels continue to improve with clients. Of note, client volumes in 
FX increased from the first quarter, refl
ecting stronger activity in the 
Americas.
 
Our rates revenues for the first half of 2011 were higher than the same 
period last year, although the second quarter revenues were down from the 
very strong first quarter. Credit revenues reflected strength in str
uctured 
credit although were lower than the first quarter, due primarily to the decline 
in securitized products after a notably strong first quarter.
 
Results in the fixed income business also included $471 million in gains 
related to monolines. We made cha
nges to our hedging program related to 
monolines during the quarter, as we continue to actively manage this mark
-
to
-
market exposure. We will continue to evaluate this exposure and hedges 
as appropriate going forward. Other sales and trading negative revenu
es of 
$510 million primarily reflected the usual items, but in particular, losses on 
our loan book this quarter.
 
Turning to VAR. Averaged trading VAR increased to $145 million versus $121 
million last quarter and compares to $139 million in the second quar
ter of 
last year. In Global Wealth Management, we continued to make progress on 
the integration, with attractive asset flows in the quarter even during a 
seasonally weak period. Revenues of $3.5 billion were up slightly from the 
prior quarter and up 13% ve
rsus the prior year.
 
Revenues in the Investment Banking line within GWM highlight the benefits 
of our solid issuance calendar. Trading and commissions were lower, 
reflecting reduced levels of retail engagement, with investor conviction 
declining throughout
 
the quarter. Asset Management fees were up due to 
higher indices at the start of the quarter on higher assets under 
management.
 
The other revenue line includes gains related to sales out of our AFS 
portfolio among other items. Noninterest expenses were $3
.2 billion, up 2% 
from last quarter. The compensation ratio of 62% in the quarter continues to 
be driven primarily by the formulaic grid payout and business mix. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1 billion, up from $964 million in the first 
quarter and prima
rily reflect the implementation of the new FDIC 
assessment, with approximately $45 million of incremental non
-
compensation expenses in the second quarter. This was driven by an 
increase in the assessment on Citi's depositories, but partially offset by a 
de
cline in the assessment on the Morgan Stanley depositories. Based on 
steps taken by Citi, we expect the assessment for the third quarter will 
return to approximately first quarter levels. Non
-
compensation expense 
includes integration costs of approximately
 
$98 million.
 
Profit before tax was $322 million and the PBT margin was 9.3%, up about 
250 basis points year
-
over
-
year. NCI for the quarter was $4 million, down 
from $74 million in the first quarter. Total client assets remained strong at 
over $1.7 trillio
n and well above prior
-
year levels on market appreciation 
and net asset inflows of $2.9 billion in the quarter, which represents a 
marked improvement from outflows in the second quarter last year.
 
Net fee
-
based asset flows were $9.7 billion, driving fee
-
ba
sed assets under 
management to a record
-
high $509 billion at quarter end, up 29% year
-
over
-
year. We see fee
-
based assets as valuable for our clients and the firm, 
because they enable us to leverage the power of the platform on behalf of 
clients and deliver
 
a more stable revenue stream. Over the last 12 months, 
net fee
-
based asset flows were $45 billion. The number of FAs was 17,638, 
down just over 160 sequentially in line with our prior comments on FA 
headcount. Bank deposits were $110 billion, of which $56
 
billion are held by 
Morgan Stanley Bank.
 
Turning to Asset Management. We continue to make progress and take the 
appropriate steps in rebuilding our business, reflected in higher revenues 
and AUM over last quarter. In Traditional Asset Management, which in
cludes 
our long
-
only liquidity and AIP fund
-
of
-
funds businesses, revenues increased 
13% from the first quarter to $366 million and are up 44% versus the prior 
year. Results were up on higher average assets under management, driven 
by a positive market appr
eciation. Notably, these gains do not reflect much 
benefit from our significant inflows into the liquidity fund because, as is 
consistent with industry practice in a low interest
-
rate environment, we are 
waiving substantially all fees on these funds today.
 
Keep in mind that 
liquidity funds tend to generate an attractive margin in a more normalized 
interest
-
rate environment.
 
In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $175 million were up on higher marks 
versus the prior quarter, approximately $95 million were rel
ated to 
investment gains from consolidated measure [ph] of funds. The majority of 
the gains were related to third
-
party investors and are reversed in the non
-
controlling interest line.
 
In Merchant Banking, revenues of $104 million included reduced investme
nt 
gains in private equity driven by lower marks in the Asia Pacific region and 
the absence of a full quarter of revenues related to FrontPoint, but offset by 
gains in our infrastructure fund.
 
Compensation expense was $285 million in the quarter, up from $
255 
million in the first quarter, driven by a number of items, some of them one
-
time. Profit before tax was $165 million for a margin of 26%. NCI was $92 
million, up sequentially reflecting gains in consolidated real estate funds as 
previously mentioned.
 
T
otal AUM increased 7% sequentially to $296 billion driven by net asset 
inflows of $15.7 billion and market appreciation. As of May 2011, over 73% 
of our long
-
term strategies continued to outperform their respective 
benchmarks on a 3
-
, 5
-
 
and 10
-
year basis.
 
Finally, turning to our outlook. Over the next several months, we would 
expect some relief in the markets due to policy makers in Europe and the 
U.S. avoiding the precipice. In addition, we hope to see the economy 
rebound modestly due to the absence of on
e

off events that impaired global 
growth, such as the tragic tsunami in Japan and the resulting supply chain 
disruptions as well as the impact of higher oil prices due to what is being 
called the [ph] spring. That being said, activity levels are seasonally
 
slower 
in the summer months, which could be exacerbated by uncertainty in the 
market about policy, regulation and ultimately the outlook for growth.
 
On the positive side, there is ample liquidity ready to be deployed when the 
fog lifts. With $1 trillion o
f cash still on S&P 500 balance sheet, nearly 2x 
median levels and bank and client leverage at a very low level, activity could 
pick up significantly if there are real political breakthroughs. And we 
continue to chip away at opportunities to enhance the fr
anchise, building 
capital and liquidity, further building share with clients and successfully 
addressing a number of items over the last year and a half, including 
reducing legacy positions which were drags on the business, exiting noncore 
businesses to en
able us to redeploy capital to support our core business and 
as James indicated, optimizing our expense structure. What was once our 
""to

James, you noted you didn't believe you were garnering much attention for 
the MUFG conversion. I gue
ss in that context, given your capital levels 
appear well above Basel targets, how are you prioritizing capital 
management here? I know you've mentioned in your past your desire to 
buy
-
in the first stake at Smith Barney, but given where the stock is tradin
g 
below tangible book and you're checking these priorities off the list, does it 
make sense at all to you to shift focus here on maybe repurchasing shares?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, firstly, Howard, I think about this 2 chapters. The first chapter is to 
build our
selves into a fortress position, where we have the capital at the 
levels that we should have capital. That's been our focus, not just with the 
MUFG conversion in this quarter. Obviously, it's a mandatory conversion with 
the CIC last August and with the var
ious accretive quarters that we've had in 
between. So game #1 was put ourselves in a position of strength so that we 
do have options. Clearly, with the stock trading where it is, we're not stupid. 
We evaluate those options on a continuous basis. We have, w
ith Smith 
Barney, the ability to purchase the next 14% in May of 2012. So 
approximately 12 months from now is the first opportunity, but it is an 
open
-
ended option. We don't have to move at that date if, obviously, we felt 
that there was a better use of ca
pital at that point in time. That's something 
that we constantly evaluate, Ruth and I and the management here talk 
about all the time. We do intend to run the Smith Barney business. But we 
built flexibility into the negotiation when we purchased this back 
in early '09 
for exactly this kind of purpose. So Ruth may want to add on that broader 
capital planning, but we are focused on both long
-
term strategic intent and 
short
-
term optimization of our capital structure.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Okay. And sh
ifting gears. We can see the progress in the Institutional 
Securities business. But with that, VAR trended higher while most of your 
peers went in the opposite direction. Is that simply a function of the rebuild 
of the sales and trading efforts or do you t
hink there's other factors that 
impacted VAR? And should we expect that to continue?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, I think you framed it well in your question. We have been on the view 
that we can increase market share by about 2% initially and continue to 
build from 
there. And really, what we're doing is building share back to 
levels where it was historically, back to where it was when Kenny was 
running the business previously, more in line with business, our other 
businesses. And so we're gaining traction with client
s. I think we're seeing 
that. Third
-
party surveys are underscoring that. And with respect to VAR, 
we're basically running at levels we have historically. And I think notably, we 
ended the first quarter at VAR pretty close to these levels, saw strength 
cont
inuing with clients throughout the quarter. It did come down at the end 
of the quarter. In fact, end
-
of
-
quarter VAR was 129, because we really saw 
clients starting to back away from the markets with the ongoing uncertainty, 
in particular, in Europe. But th
is is very much, I think, a continuation of 
building up the franchise.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Okay. And then just on Europe, Ruth, could you just update us on gross and 
net exposures related to peripheral Europe? And how you're thinking in 
managing
 
risks specific to that region?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Absolutely. So EMEA, obviously, is an important market for us, and we've 
been focused on managing our exposures in the periphery for quite some 
time. The net funded exposure to the peripherals, Greece, Ireland, Po
rtugal, 
Italy and Spain is about $2 billion. This includes exposure to sovereigns, 
corporates and financial institutions. It does exclude the benefit of any 
peripheral sovereign collateral and hedges purchased from peripheral banks 
against peripheral risk.
 
And our gross exposure's about $5 billion. Both net 
and gross exposures exclude unfunded loans and any overnight deposits, 
and we'll have more details on all of this in the Q.

The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
 
Glenn Schor

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
First of all, good for you for turning around the MBA hedge. But let's exclude 
last quarter's loss and this quarter's gain and let's exclude DVA. If you look 
at SIC [ph], I think it was down a little bit more quarter
-
on
-
quart
er and 
year
-
on
-
year versus the peer group, obviously, better than Goldman but a 
little less than the peer group. I heard the opening comments about 
connectivity in some of the surveys. Just the thought process as we're going 
on 2 years in, in terms of reve
nue ramp relative to peers. And I say it 
relative to peers because, obviously, it's a tough market. So just the thought 
process on what to expect there as you continue to build out and are you 
done building out now?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So a couple of things. First,
 
overall fixed income and commodities 
performance was very much affected, as I noted, by the activity in the 
commodities market. We have a strong team in commodities. It's historically 
been a very strong business for us, but was down meaningfully relative 
to 
last quarter and relative to prior periods. And as we've talked about in the 
past, our commodities business is really a mix of 2 businesses, structured 
solutions for clients and flows. And usually, that diversification helps us, but 
both were weak in th
e second quarter. And so we had the results was 
trading was lower. And the clients' side, the lack of trending volatility 
prevented consumers and producers to commit to hedging. So revenues, 
while positive, were down quite significantly quarter
-
over
-
quarte
r. And the 
lower levels in commodity really masked, we think, the relative progress 
across the balance of the fixed income franchise. So we're continuing to do 
what we've talked about in the past. We're focused on consistent progress. 
We said it would take
 
some time to continue to build up our share in fixed 
income but are pleased with the progress we're making. And the hiring we 
did is, I think, a core part of it. We have the team in place, and they're 
continuing to focus on driving share.
 
James Gorman
 
I j
ust want to add, Glenn, I just want to add something to that, and I've said 
this before. Leadership really matters in these businesses. And I think Kenny 
is doing a terrific job. We're fortunate to have somebody that experienced 
coming back into that role.
 
And the team around him, we really have a team 
on the field now that can get this job done. But it takes some time. The SRM 
program we've built up, the connectivity that we're seeing through the 
surveys, the integration with TIPIC [ph] and the team in equ
ities is very 
important, and it's a series of small steps.
 
Glenn Schorr

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Well, I definitely appreciate that. It sounds like rates and FX were actually 
up quarter
-
on
-
quarter, given the beat down on commodities. So that is the 
pro
gress, because I don't think the markets were.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Actually, the rates business is up first half over first half. It was down off of 
what was a very strong first quarter. But we're overall very pleased with the 
performance across our desks.
 
Glenn Sc
horr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Okay, I appreciate that. And then in Wealth Management, obviously, tough 
markets and low rates. You can only do so much. But can you update us 
specifically on the systems conversion side and where we're at in both what 
nee
ds to get done? What's gotten done? And then what that can produce in 
cost saves?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We've talked for a very long time about the platform being completed built 
by the third quarter of 2011 and moving all of the Morgan Stanley financial 
advisors ont
o the platform by the end of the third quarter of '11. And here 
we are in the third quarter, and we're very much on track for that, so 
pleased with that. The next step is training the Smith Barney financial 
advisers, moving them on to the platform. That wi
ll begin at the end of this 
quarter and goes through mid
-
next year, and so very much on track with 
the integration. We're continuing to spend. It was, I think, $98 million 
integration spend this quarter. But to your question, one of the key elements 
to inc
reasing profitability across Morgan Stanley Smith Barney is completion 
of the integration, and this is a very important milestone.
 
James Gorman
 
I just want to 
--
 
Glenn, on this, the way I think about it is every month that 
we go through this integration is
 
a month that we're not spending in the 
future. In other words, we're one step closer. And at the same time, Greg 
Fleming, Jim Rosenthal and the team working on the integration with 
Baricocoin [ph] are looking at beyond the Smith Barney piece which occurs,
 
as Ruth said, early, middle part of next year. What else we really need to do 
to get ourselves faster to the finish line? So we've taken aggressive relook at 
the back end of some of the integration steps.

The next question will come from Mike May
o with CLSA.
 
Michael Mayo

Credit Agricole Securities (

Just wanted to follow up on the Wealth Management. So the margin was 
down linked quarter, but it would have gone up from 10% to 11% if not
 
for 
the FDIC charge, is that correct?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The FDIC charge was incremental. We had number of ins and outs with the 
business. But as I indicated, the FDIC charge, we believe, is fully going away 
this quarter.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole 
Securities (
USA
) Inc.
 
All right. So all things considered, the margin in the third quarter should be 
11%?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, we also had the sale out, the incremental gain I noted in the other line, 
which was
 
sale out of the AFS portfolio. So as I indicated, we had a number 
of ups and downs. And we're adding on top of that, real focus on expense 
management to continue to drive it forward, but I'm not going to put a 
number out there now.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit A
gricole Securities (
USA

Okay. And then the net inflows to Wealth Management, it wasn't a whole lot 
relative to the $1.7 trillion of assets, at least compared to say, some of the 
pure
-
play brokers, t
he online players like Ameritrade, Schwab, even 
E*TRADE had higher inflows. Now you've turned it around, but when do you 
think we'll see more substantive inflows?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, you hit the right point, which is when we look year
-
over
-
year, we're 
very pl
eased with going from some meaningful outflow second quarter of 
last year to inflows this year. And we are continuing to see that kind of 
progress that's affecting our overall flows in the business. The other point I 
made is that we're quite focused on man
aged money, given what that does 
for our clients and for the business. And that's a helpful added boost to 
overall performance in Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
US
A
) Inc.
 
And then lastly, as it relates to expense control for Wealth Management or 
for the firm as a whole, I might have missed this, but what are your overall 
targets to improve any measure of expenses or efficiency?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We think of really the expe
nse management as a 3
-
legged stool. There's the 
tactical expense management, which we continue to do, and as James just 
noted, was were very focused across our businesses. But in particular, Greg 
is really pushing hard within Morgan Stanley Smith Barney to
 
help drive 
margin. There is the office of reengineering that we've spoken about 
previously, which is really stepping back from some of the more tactical, 
cost
-
cutting initiatives and looking at what broader changes we can make in 
the way we're addressing 
spend. For example, more meaningful looks at 
what we're doing in technology, where can things be outsourced more 
efficiently, what can we do on legal entity structure, a whole host of 
initiatives that we've identified, built
-
up, bottoms
-
up to the office of
 
reengineering and established $1 billion run rate savings over 3 years 
coming from that leg of the stool. And then we're very focused on 
headcount. So as I indicated previously in the year, making sure that we're 
quite focused on reducing, in particular, 
underperformers. As I noted, our 
headcount was down amongst FAs in Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. We're 
having that same kind of discipline across the business. And obviously, that's 
not just compensation expense but every employee has a multiplier effect 
wi
th them. They're in the building, they use data, there are a whole host of 
things that go along with it. So that kind of control over headcount, it's 
really those 3 that drive, will drive noncomp and comp control.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities 
(
USA
) Inc.
 
All right.
 
James Gorman
 
Can I just go back to your question on flows? Because we're kind of an 
inflection point here in the industry. You're right in the observation against 
the online players. The full
-
service firms typically have much larger outflows 
in the second quarter becau
se of tax season. But a more sort of strategic 
issue is what is the quality of the assets? And I've noticed at least one of our 
competitors has stopped reporting net new money. What really matters is 
the net new annuitized money and the revenue that you ge
nerate on 
annuitized assets versus transaction assets. So that will be an increasing 
part of the conversation going forward.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
Maybe on the tradi
ng side, and I guess particularly on equities but even on 
the fixed income side, when we look at rates, FX and credit. Year
-
over
-
year 
last 
--
 
or second quarter is pretty challenging as well. But when you look at 
since you made those investments, it's alway
s hard, we all compare 
revenues across the businesses and across the peers. But in terms of market 
share, can you dig down and provide any detail on product levels in terms of 
where you've gone or where you come from? And then where you see 
additional oppo
rtunities?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, starting with equities. I think there's a lot of 
--
 
it's the best reported 
quarter since 2008. And that really was with broad strength and with the 
backdrop of anemic industry volumes. So the data we've looked at 
underscores tha
t we're gaining share really across the globe. And I think it's 
really a testament to the great job the team is doing. But we saw 
improvement in our prime brokerage franchise. We continued to see 
strength, again, across products in a challenging market, bu
t it really goes 
to the strength of the franchise. Our Delta One business, although revenues 
were lower in line with the decline on industry volumes, what we're seeing is 
share is up. And similarly, in our Derivatives business, we're seeing strong 
client f
lows. So it is, I think, is evidenced by the numbers. They speak for 
themselves. In terms of share, we're doing well across the board. And in 
fixed income, again, what we're seeing is greater activity, greater flow. The 
data that we've looked at goes more 
to some of the qualitative factors. 
We're having greater traction with clients. They're turning to us more. And 
again, I think what you'll see when everyone reports is it will be our best 
way to have a proxy for what overall is the share. We've targeted 2%
 
market share growth. And the way we measure our progress is we look at 
the top 9 players globally and just take our revenues relative to the entire 
pool. And we look forward to the rest of our peers reporting, so we can try 
and quantify that answer.
 
Micha
el Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
Okay. And then just as a follow
-
up, earlier this year, you discussed the 
reengineering or the cost initiatives over the next 3 years and targeting 
around $1 billion. And when I think about the industry, we're seeing quite a 
fe
w banks, brokers kind of go down the same path. Some are taking a faster 
approach, like may be in the next 6 months, in the next 12 months. And so I 
guess when you look at the macro headwinds, the regulatory pressures, one 
is do you feel that's enough? And
 
two is are there any businesses within 
Morgan Stanley that you feel like given the regulatory changes and the 
pressures, can be done better or can compete better on its own with other 
pure plays?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So strategically, we think the portfolio of busi
nesses we have is a potent 
combination. And we have exited a number of businesses, and as you've 
seen over the last couple of years. And we're very focused on the kind of the 
symbiotic nature between what we're doing on the institutional origination 
and di
stribution side on the one hand and retail distribution on the other. 
And within Institutional Securities, the ability to deliver across products for 
our clients. So I would say on that, we're very pleased with the portfolio of 
businesses we have. And with
in our Investment Management business, we 
see opportunity for growth given the performance of across a lot of the 
funds and the power of this brand around the globe. So as it really goes to 
the second part of your question, or maybe it was the first part o
f your 
question, what else can we be doing with respect to our cost structure? We 
have 3 legs of the stool. We're very focused on each one of those legs, the 
tactical expense, the strategic through the office of reengineering and 
headcount, and making sure
 
we're doing what we can to drive returns across 
the business. I would say, as an example, in sales and trading, when we 
announced our hiring program over a year and a half ago, we were very 
careful to point out that we were looking to hire to narrow the g
ap to our 
peers but not to close the gap to our peers. In fact, back then, we talked 
about having headcount that was maybe 20% to 25% lower than our peers, 
with the view that they would come down to us rather than us going fully up 
to them. And so what we'
re very pleased about is we have a strong cohesive 
team that's making progress on our market share goals. And I think that's 
part of the reason you're not hearing comments like that from us, because 
we never, we didn't close that gap fully.

The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.
 
Guy Moszkowski

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
I was wondering, first of all, if you would have an estimate of your pro forma 
Basel III basis core Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second qua
rter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So Tier 1 common would be around 6.5% to 7% under Basel III at the end 
of the second quarter, the range really being depending on the treatment of 
the MSSB NCI of $4.3 billion. And of course, that's looking at our balance 
sheet as of the s
econd quarter. There's no benefit for any mitigation that 
--
 
past mitigation or anything that would roll off over time.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. And are you still estimating about the same sort of RWA inflation and 
mitigation that you ha
d talked about potentially in the past? No real change 
there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No real change. We're comfortable with the prior guidance of about $480 
billion risk
-
weighted assets by year
-
end 2012.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, that's helpful. Back t
o GWM. I'm just trying to envision what we 
should really be looking for in terms of how the expense dollars might 
evolve. As you complete the systems integration, first, of the legacy Morgan 
Stanley folks and then the legacy Smith Barney people for the nex
t 12 
months, how will we see that really manifested in the P&L?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the integration spend has been running at about 80 to 100 a quarter. And 
we will continue 
--
 
we've finished the technology platform this quarter and 
moved the Morgan Stanley FAs 
over, as I said. But we are continuing to 
spend as we go through the training of the Smith Barney FAs and running in 
parallel to ensure data quality, data integrity through kind of mid
-
next year. 
And so you really start seeing the benefit of the integratio
n spend rolling off 
more towards the back half of next year.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. And is all of that captured in the, I think you said $98 million type of 
numbers that you've been telling us each quarter? Is it integration or it's 
mo
re than that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, that's the integration spend.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. So that's what we should expect to see go away but not any other 
costs of supporting legacy systems that somehow aren't captured in that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So to
 
be clear, as I said, it starts rolling off because we continue to do 
--
 
we 
get the Smith Barney FAs moved on, on the second half of 
--
 
or at the end 
of the first half of next year. And then we have incremental work with the 
Morgan Stanley Private Wealth M
anagement system, but it's rolling down 
through next year.
 
James Gorman
 
Got it. And then final...
 
James Rosenthal
 
There is another aspect to it, which we have not quantified but clearly is 
going to be a focus. Once you integrate the systems, you're putting
 
800 
branches all on the same system. That means all the branch office 
infrastructure is now coordinated. So where we have capacity utilization 
issues, say you have 2 offices in one regional city a couple of miles from 
each other, we can't move those peopl
e yet. We can't consolidate the 
infrastructure. We can't get rid of dead real estate, because they're in 
different systems. They'd be moving to an office, they might be on the 
wrong system and all their clients' records, cost bases on accounts and some 
wou
ld be gone. So once the integration is done, we have a lot more 
flexibility as to how you manage across those 800 branches.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Right. Yes, I kind of thought there had to be more somehow. And does that 
include the fact that 
even at the branch level, you might have what that 
then will be sort of redundant systems and operations folks?
 
James Gorman
 
I mean again, we haven't quantified that. But that will be the work that gets 
done once you're all on one platform.
 
Guy 
Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. Final question that I have relates to the monolines, and how those 
positive revenues this quarter, negative last quarter related to the 
--
 
the 
actual underlying positions that those things were put in place to hedge,
 
I 
mean I've had some discussions with clients this morning about should you 
back that out or add it back in the first quarter? And I guess to me, what's 
really relevant is to what extent did that revenue actually or positively to 
offset losses in what was
 
clearly a very difficult, distressed mortgage
-
type 
environment. Can you give us a little color for how to think about the 470 in 
that context?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. So we adjusted 
--
 
we obviously adjusted the hedges. If we had not 
adjusted the hedges, we would
 
have had losses again this quarter. And so 
the risk management around this was an important part of the story and the 
outcome. I think more broadly within our Securitization business, if you're 
asking about mortgages, that is consistently a very strong bu
siness for us. 
We traded and risk managed well in what was a difficult market. We were off 
from a very strong first quarter that was driven by client demand, but still 
had good performance in that business and are really pleased with the work 
the team did 
in what was a challenging market.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. And maybe just a little more color then on what kind of adjustments 
you made to the monoline hedge to get a better outcome?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as we've said in the past, we constantly
 
evaluate the position and adjust 
the hedges. And we'll continue look at the position and assess where we 
think it's best to be and where we kind of where we think the position of the 
markets will be.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from William Tanon
a with UBS.
 
William Tanona 
-
 
One of your competitors earlier this week had mentioned that Europe and 
Asia were particularly weak. And if we look at your results, obviously, we 
saw that in Europe but did not see that in Asia. Asia was actually very, very 
st
rong for you guys. Can you give us some color and context around what 
drove that significant performance this quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, overall, we have a very strong business in Asia across Sales and 
Trading, Banking. I think one of the points though to f
ocus on quarter
-
over
-
quarter is we did have the loss in MUMMS, at our MUMSS joint venture last 
quarter. So when you normalize through that, we're basically in line. But I 
guess again, it goes 
--
 
the strength that we saw is because of cost of the 
businesses
, Sales and Trading and Investment Banking. Europe was strong 
in our equity underwriting area, as I noted, large rights issues and IPOs. But 
fundamentally, it was a tougher market in Europe with the backdrop of the 
European sovereign crisis.
 
William Tanona
 
-
 
Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess going back to equities. Obviously, a 
very strong quarter for you guys, and you guys were the only ones that 
were up quarter
-
over
-
quarter versus your peers. And I know you mentioned 
volatility, I know you mentioned 
prime brokerage, but can you give us any 
additional color as to what really helped to drive that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think the strength of it, as I've already noted, was that we had breadth 
across products and around the globe. And so that's an important part of
 
the 
franchise. I'd say on our Prime Brokerage business, the revenues were up 
meaningfully versus the prior quarter. But as I noted, balances were up only 
modestly. And what we're really focused on within Prime Brokerage is the 
adjacencies across the equit
y franchise. So we think that's, again, this 
notion of connecting the dots across the business and the benefit of really 
leveraging what we have across Morgan Stanley, and you see that in these 
numbers because even in a market with lower industry volumes a
nd cash 
equities, our business is continuing to do well.

I guess I wanted to come back

a couple of issues have been brought up. 
First on ca
pital. I guess when you reiterated, I guess, what you said in the 
past but if you are going to be at a roughly 10% Tier 1 common ratio under 
Basel III, wondering what 
--
 
how you think about what level you wanted 
--
 
would actually want to run at relative to
 
the SIFI buffer assuming, let's say, 
you're 9%? Would you look to run at a buffer, 100 basis points or so, to 
that? And do you think it's important to be there immediately? Or other 
firms have suggested they might lag into it. And I ask that in the contex
t of 
whatever decision you may want to make around the next Smith Barney 
purchase opportunity.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So it's obviously a topic that's in flux. But the way we think about it is we 
expect our to SIFI buffer will be around 2%, based on the guidance we've
 
heard. We are hoping we get some final clarity resolution by year end. And 
our view is that although there are theoretical kind of phase
-
in through 2019 
from everything we've seen so far, we think the market will expect us to be 
at those types of levels m
uch sooner than the kind of 2019 Basel grid. And 
so we're looking to run closer to that number sooner. And our expectation is 
that with much higher capital levels, not only has the required percentage 
changed, but obviously, both the quality of capital and
 
the calculation of 
risk
-
weighted assets is different, so it's meaningfully higher, which means 
that our buffer on that number appropriately could run at a lower level at 
about 50 or 100 basis points. I think we're still trying to assess what level's 
appro
priate. But I think the added factor as we think about it, and very 
much to James' point, is we continue to operate in a very uncertain 
environment. The macro backdrop is uncertain. And we think that having 
this type of very strong capital position does gi
ve us some flexibility, which 
is important. Strong capital and strong liquidity really provide a kind of 
fortress foundation, and it give us the flexibility as we get greater clarity on 
what is the SIFI buffer, what is the phase
-
in to then assess what's th
e best 
next step and the most optimized views of that capital to drive returns.

Okay. And then as it relates to all of that and in Smith Barney. Is it, if you 
by the 
--
 
if you do buy the next 14% next year, does the impact 
to Tier 1 
capital ratio under Basel III actually 
--
 
is it fair to say that's probably a 
bigger increase than what the cost of that piece would be? In other words, 
there is a revaluation of what's remaining that would drive RWA up as well?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, I
 
think what we're most focused on is 
--
 
what's an appropriate price is in 
the best interest of our shareholders, and that's really the factor that would 
drive what's the adjustment to book value. It's not really an RWA, kind of an 
RWA concept as much.

Okay, all right. And then I wanted to just ask separately on coming back to 
VAR. The increase, I guess, the rates and the credits were up about 25% 
sequentially. And I just wanted to square that with the there's the 
commentary 
around client close being lower sequentially. Were there more 
concentrated positions you built around your risk book during the quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So our VAR was, overall, in line with where we've been running it for the, as 
I noted, for kind of since fou
rth quarter '09. And similarly, in the credit rates 
line, you'll see the same kind of trend. I think what's notable is at the end of 
the first quarter, we were running with VAR above $134 million. And the 
average this quarter was up some from that but came
 
down at the end of 
the quarter. And so our ending number was $129 million. Why? Because it 
was really towards the end of the quarter, really in June, we started seeing 
more concern amongst investors with the ongoing issues, in particular, in 
Europe. So we
 
had good activity. And I think, our view very much across the 
franchise is that what clients expect of us is content with a point of view and 
that we put balance sheet and risk around that to facilitate trading where it 
makes sense. And I think in particu
lar, in times like this, they're looking for 
a point of view and that's what our team is very much focused on. So the 
volumes that you saw coming off of the first quarter persisted for a good 
part of the second quarter, and then came down towards the end o
f the 
second quarter.
 
Roger Freeman

Barclays Capital
 
Okay. And then just last question. On commodities specifically, that VAR 
came down. I guess 2 questions. One, was commodities actually positive in 
the quarter? And secondly, was that a business that yo
u pulled back on in 
terms of capital deployment or that was just not getting knocked around a 
lot?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Revenues were positive. And this was something where, again, it was 
business leaders' view based on activity they were seeing with clients, which 
was quite muted given the 
--
 
what was going on in the broad markets. 
Everyone basically stepped away from that market. So on the flow side, as I 
noted, given the dramatic swings that were going on, in particular in oil, 
energy, were strong. It really drove
 
a lot of the activity to the sidelines. And 
similarly, there wasn't much on the hedging side given what was going on in 
the market. So this was very client
-
driven, less activity really stepping back 
from the market after what transpired throughout the qua
rter.

Thank you so much for joining us for our call, and we look forward to 
speaking to you again in October.

7/19/18,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. 
Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today's presentation may include 
forward
-
looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or 
beliefs and are subject to 
risks and uncertainties that may cause actual 
results to differ materially.
 
The presentation may also include certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. 
Please see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of 
such non
-
GAAP measures to the com
parable GAAP figures and for a 
discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future 
results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan 
Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is 
not 
an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.
 
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Office James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you, Kathleen, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us 
on what is the last 
earnings call from our favorite CFO, Ruth Porat. I will now 
give you some highlights for the first quarter results and mark to market our 
execution against the strategic plan that we provided an update of in 
January.
 
We begin this year on a solid footing w
ith all businesses contributing to our 
performance. Excluding DVA, this was the strongest quarter in firm revenue 
and PBT in many years. In fact, it was the second best quarter in revenue, 
ex
-
DVA, in the firm's 80 year history.
 
Key highlights include the f
ollowing. Equity showed continued leadership. We 
delivered strong performance across products and regions both quarter over 
quarter and year over year. Fixed income delivered a stronger quarter 
consistent with our strategy.
 
Investment Banking performed sol
idly and the pipeline remains healthy. 
Wealth Management achieved record revenue, record revenue per financial 
advisor and delivered a pretax margin of 22%. Investment Management 
results were steady but there's more to be done as this business remains an 
i
mportant part of our growth opportunity.
 
Most significantly we took a meaningful step toward achieving our state of 
return on equity target, delivering in this quarter an ROE of 10.1%. This ROE 
excludes the affect of the net discrete tax benefit and DVA. O
n a reported 
basis, as you'll have seen, the ROE for the quarter was actually 14.2%. This 
performance reflects our strategic plan and demonstrates the business' 
flexibility to respond to increased client activity and market movements.
 
While the firm has cl
early made progress, there remains work to be done in 
achieving the six
-
point plan we laid out in January. An update of which I'll 
briefly provide today. First, we continue to improve our wealth management 
margin, which reached 22% for the quarter. The bus
iness is also benefiting 
from additional factors described during our last call.
 
Secondly, we'll continue to execute on our bank strategy through deploying 
our deposits and again delivering prudent loan growth across Wealth 
Management and institutional sec
urities.
 
Third, fixed income and commodities saw its strongest revenue quarter in 
three years, as volumes returned to the market with increased volatility. 
This quarter was important evidence of the execution of our strategy to 
significantly reduce the cap
ital required to support the fixed income 
business, while maintaining the appropriately sized global footprint to meet 

one quarter.
 
Fourth, we're just beginning to realize the ben
efit of lower funding costs as 
we refinance the debt post crisis. This provides us with a tailwind across the 
businesses. We maintained our focus on expense management discipline and 
showed strong progress in the first quarter, delivering an overall expens
e 
ratio of 72%, excluding DVA. This level reflects an Institutional Securities 
compensation ratio of 38% and that ratio is consistent with our stated target 
of being at or below 39%.
 
Finally, with respect to steadily increasing capital returns to sharehold
ers, 
we were pleased to receive a non
-
objection from the Federal Reserve on our 
2015 capital plan to increase our dividend to $0.15 per quarter and a 
repurchase up to $3.1 billion of common stock for the five quarters 
beginning in the second quarter of thi
s year.
 
We hope to maintain this trend of increasing dividends and share 
repurchases in future cycles, subject of course to regulatory approval. In 
aggregate, we continue to execute against the benchmarks previously 
established and will remain focused on t
hem for the duration of 2015.
 
Before closing I would like to note several organization changes we recently 
made. These changes, where we moved executives across the firm, reflect 
our strong desire to build a very deep bench of senior management for the 
yea
rs ahead. And finally, I would like to thank our CFO Ruth Porat for her 
partnership, friendship and commitment to Morgan Stanley and to me 
personally.
 
She has been an extraordinarily highly valued part of my team for the five 
years and a tremendous asset t
o this firm since her arrival. We indeed have 
been lucky to have her. We are delighted to appoint as CFO, Jon Pruzan, a 
20 year veteran of our investment banking division at the end of this month, 
and I wish John luck in this new role.
 
I will now turn the 
call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in detail.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, James, and good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and 
results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the 
footnotes to the earnings release to reconc
ile these non
-
GAAP measures.
 
Results for the first
-
quarter include a net discrete tax benefit of $564 million, 
or $0.29 per diluted share, primarily associated with the repatriation of non
-
US earnings at a lower cost than originally estimated. In addition,
 
the impact 
of DVA in the quarter was a positive $125 million, with $100 million in fixed 
income sales and trading and $25 million in equity sales and trading. 
Excluding the impact of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues were $9.8 billion, up 30% 
versus the fourth quar
ter.
 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders, excluding DVA, were $2.2 billion. Earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share, excluding DVA, were $1.14 after preferred 
dividends.
 
On a GAAP basis, includ
ing the impact of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues for the 
quarter were $9.9 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to 
Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $2.3 billion.
 
Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $1.18 
a
fter preferred dividends. Reported return on equity from continuing 
operations was 14.2% in the first quarter, excluding both DVA and the net 
discrete tax benefit, our ROE for the quarter was 10.1%. Book value at the 
end of the quarter was $33.80 per share
 
and tangible book value was 
$28.91 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $829 billion at March 31, up 
from $802 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Deposits as of quarter end 
were $136 billion, up $2 billion versus Q4. Our liqui
dity reserve at the end of 
the quarter was $195 billion, compared with $193 billion at the end of the 
fourth quarter.
 
Turning to capital. Although our calculations are not final, our common 
equity tier 1 transitional ratio will be approximately 13.1% and o
ur tier 1 
capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 14.7%.
 
Basel III transitional risk weighted assets are expected to be approximately 
$440 billion at March 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal 
Reserve rules, our pro forma com
mon equity tier 1 ratio using the Basel III, 
fully phased
-
in advanced approach was 11.6% at March 31, up from 10.7% 
in the fourth quarter.
 
Our pro forma standardized ratio was 11.6%, up from 10.9% in the fourth 
quarter. Pro forma, fully phased
-
in Basel III
 
advanced RWAs are expected to 
be approximately $449 billion. Pro forma, fully phased
-
in Basel III 
standardized RWAs are expected to be approximately $446 billion.
 
We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the US final 
rule to be 
approximately 5.1% at March 31, up from 4.7% at the end of 4Q. 
All of these estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision.
 
Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $7.1 billion, down 
34% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation expe
nse was $4.5 billion in 
the quarter, down 11%, driven primarily by the change in compensation 
structure discussed in the fourth quarter, partly offset by increased 
compensation related to higher revenue.
 
Non
-
compensation expense was $2.5 billion for the qu
arter, down 55% 
quarter over quarter driven by decreased legal expense as well as continued 
expense discipline.
 
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, 
revenues excluding DVA were $5.3 billion, up 45% sequentially after 
ex
cluding the implementation charge for FDA in 4Q. Non
-
interest expense 
was $3.6 billion, down 49% versus the fourth quarter due to legal expenses 
and the compensation expense adjustment occurred in the prior quarter.
 
Compensation expense was $2 billion for 
the first quarter, down 17% versus 
the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of the change in compensation 
structure I just noted.
 
Excluding DVA, the compensation ratio was 38%, down quarter over quarter 
and down approximately 300 basis points year
-
over
-
yea
r, reflecting the 
impact of the change in compensation structure and operating leverage in 
the business.
 
Non
-
compensation expense was $1.6 billion, down 65% versus the fourth 
quarter, driven by significantly lower legal expense in the quarter. Including 
th
e impact of DVA, revenues were $5.5 billion.
 
In investment banking, revenues of $1.2 billion were down 
-
 
last quarter. 
According to Thomson
-
Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked at number one in 
global IPOs and number three in global equity and global announced M
&A at 
the end of the first quarter. Notable transactions included, in advisory 
Morgan Stanley acted as sole financial advisor to AbbVie in its acquisition of 
Pharmacyclics for an aggregate value of $20 billion. AbbVie obtained 
financing for Morgan Stanley 
and MUFG.
 
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley as joint global coordinator, lead left 
book runner and stabilization agents, priced a $3.7 billion follow
-
on offering 
for Citizens Financial Group. This was the largest financial institutions follow
-
on offer
ing since 2012. In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as active 
book runner for Coca
-
Cola in its EUR8.5 billion senior unsecured notes, 
offering the largest euro transaction for a US issuer on record and the 
second largest euro transaction of all time
.
 
Advisory revenues of $471 million decreased 3% versus our fourth
-
quarter 
results, driven by lower revenues in EMEA and Asia. Underwriting revenues 
of $702 million decreased 13% versus our fourth quarter results, driven by 
equity underwriting revenues of 
$307 million, down 11% versus 4Q 
reflecting fewer IPOs and lower revenues from EMEA and Asia.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $395 million, down 15% versus the 
fourth quarter, primarily due to decreases in non
-
investment grade loans 
and high
-
yield bo
nds that more than offset increases in investment grade 
activity.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $2.3 billion, up 40% 
compared to last quarter. Results reflected broad
-
based gains across 
products and regions. Cash equities saw incre
ased volume and share gain. 
Derivatives revenues were higher across regions. Prime brokerage revenues 
increased, driven by an uptick in balances and client activity.
 
Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, 
were $1.9 billion,
 
up significantly versus the fourth quarter. Commodities 
results were up meaningfully versus the fourth quarter, benefiting from 
structured transactions, improved client flow and extreme weather.
 
Fixed Income revenues increased quarter over quarter driven 
by increased 
contribution across regions, with particular strength in macro products and 
EMEA. Average trading VaR for the first quarter was $47 million, flat to the 
fourth quarter.
 
Turning to wealth management. Revenues were $3.8 billion in the first 
quar
ter, up 1% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.1 billion 
were relatively flat with the last quarter.
 
Transaction revenues were down 3% compared to last quarter consisting 
primarily of commissions of $526 million, down 8% to the prior quarter 
driv
en in part by fewer trading days as well as activity levels.
 
Investment banking related fees of $192 million, up 11% versus last quarter 
primarily reflecting a revenue
-
sharing arrangement with Institutional 
Securities related to municipal securities. And t
rading revenues of $232 
million, a slight uptick versus the fourth quarter. Net interest revenue 
increased 10% to $689 million, driven primarily by investment portfolio 
returns as well as continued growth in lending products.
 
Non
-
interest expense was $3 bi
llion, down 3% versus last quarter. Non
-
compensation expense was $754 million, down 3% from last quarter. 
Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, down 3% versus the fourth quarter, 
in part due to the change in compensation structure last quarter as well as 
a 
revenue mix change, with growth in non
-
compensable revenues this quarter.
 
The compensation ratio was 58%, down versus the fourth quarter. The TBT 
margin was 22%, profit before tax was $855 million. Total client assets were 
$2 trillion. Global fee
-
based a
sset inflows were $13.3 billion, fee
-
based 
assets under management increased to $803 billion at quarter end, 
representing 39% of client assets.
 
Global representatives were 15,915, down 1% to the fourth quarter. 
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $13
5 billion, down $3 billion 
versus the fourth quarter. Approximately $130 billion were held in Morgan 
Stanley banks. Wealth management lending balances continued to grow, 
reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy.
 
Investment management revenues 
of $669 million were up 14% 
sequentially. In traditional asset management, revenues of $439 million 
were up 2% versus the fourth quarter. In Merchant Banking and real estate 
investing, revenues of $230 million were up compared with the fourth 
quarter drive
n by higher investment gain.
 
Non
-
interest expenses were $482 million, down 19% from the fourth quarter 
due to the change in compensation structure discussed last quarter.
 
Compensation expense was $273 million in the quarter reflecting a 
compensation ratio 
of 41%. Non
-
compensation expense was $209 million, 
down 2% from the fourth quarter. Profit before tax was $187 million in the 
first quarter. NCI was $17 million versus $12 million last quarter. Total 
assets under management increased to $406 billion driven
 
by market 
appreciation.
 
Turning now to our outlook. In the first quarter the firm benefited from 
growing investor and corporate interest in global opportunities, with higher 
activity levels in the US complemented by a meaningful pickup in activity in 
Euro
pe and Asia.
 
In investment banking, the M&A backlog is higher than a year ago, 
supported by the trends we have discussed previously; robust cross
-
border 
activity, activism and larger transactions across industries.
 
The underwriting pipeline similarly remai
ns healthy, increasingly driven by 
acquisition activity. In sales and trading, we continue to benefit from the 
breadth of our strong, global franchise with renewed client interest in 
European and Asian markets, reflecting the varying stages of global recov
ery 
and the impact of central bank actions across product. The obvious factors 
that affect these results going forward are global events and the nature of 
volatility.
 
Our Wealth Management clients remain well engaged with their financial 
advisors. The key 
catalyst for higher activity is the level of US new issue 
activity, with the pipeline up versus Q1. Q1 levels also reflected client 
caution in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate moves which should play out 
throughout the year.
 
We are pleased to have achi
eved this starting point of our 22% to 25% 
margin target in a lower transaction environment, underscoring the great 
operating leverage in this business.
 
The outlook for our bank remains strong given the lending pipeline in our 
wealth management and 
institutional securities businesses. This enables us 
to continue to benefit from earnings upside, even without the benefit of 
rising rates.
 
Our goal with the roadmap we introduced several years ago was to address 
your many questions and be transparent thro
ugh metrics and goalposts, so 
that our progress could be measured.
 
We had early confidence that the transformation of Morgan Stanley's 
business and balance sheet would deliver returns to all of our stakeholders, 
and I am proud that the levers we articulate
d are increasingly evident.
 
Beyond the business outlook we expect to benefit from lower funding costs 
and the impact of capital returns to shareholders. Although the path to a 
sustainable acceptable ROE is not a straight line from here, I am confident 
that
 
the road is a clear one.
 
I will miss working with you and I'm grateful for the strong support and for 
the analysts on the call for your very constructive guidance and analysis. 
Thank you. It was a privilege to be in this role at this moment in Morgan 
Stan
ley's history. I thank my partner and boss, James Gorman, for the 
opportunity, but far more important for what our great team has 
accomplished.
 
We will now take your questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Your first questio
n comes from the line of Guy 
Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning, Ruth and James.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Morning.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
First question I guess, is if you could give us a little bit more color on fixed 
in
come and commodities. Given that it seems like you've had a pretty high 
hurdle to deal with commodities not only having done well in the first 
quarter of last year, but also you having sold TransMontaigne.
 
Can you give us a little bit more color on how you
 
managed to see revenue 
there actually up year
-
on
-
year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Certainly. We had strong contribution from around the globe. Strength in 
EMEA across products with meaningfully higher client volumes. The bigger 
driver was strength in macro rates and FX w
ere up nicely year over year; 
and, importantly, that's not withstanding a meaningfully lower balance 
sheet, and RWAs and fixed income were also lower; they were actually at 
$174 billion.
 
So through our target, we're keeping our target at $108 billion; but 
this 
really goes to what we've talked about over many quarters. Our focus is on 
centralized resource management, so nice performance there.
 
Credit was up from a weak fourth quarter, although not at last year's levels. 
And then as you noted in commodities, 
Q1 is seasonally strong. And even 
with the sale of TMG, TransMontaigne, in last year's results we were up. And 
the performance was across the board. It was physical client flows, 
structured transactions for clients. So we saw strength across the board 
ther
e.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Are you still looking to sell those storage and other physical businesses?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, as you've heard us say many times, we're committed to selling oil 
merchanting; and we'll let you know when we have something to say.
 
Guy Moszkowsk
i
 
Okay. Great. And maybe a little bit of color on the reduction in the RWA in 
thick in the quarter. Can you give us a sense for how much of that was from 
runoff of some of the legacy positions that you've talked about in the past 
that don't generate revenu
e?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So included both active and passive mitigation. There was some benefit from 
market move as well. It was really all three.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Okay. That's helpful. And then final question on moves in the capital 
account. There's a lot of 
moving parts it seems like this quarter. We know 
that overall capital was kind of flat. But we can see in the average 
allocations that you provide that you moved or retained more capital in the 
institutional securities business.
 
And I was wondering if you 
could give us a little sense for, given the RWA 
movement, what's going on there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, you actually answered in your question. There were some ins and outs. 
But obviously given it is an average calculation, there are timing implications 
that flow 
through. And you can see, therefore, more capital moved up to 
ISG.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
So we shouldn't necessarily expect that to remain in ISG as we move 
through the quarters of the year or is there something to do with continued 
regulatory changes that would 
drive those capital levels a little bit higher?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, over time it will. I mean, the required capital calculation is based on 
the capital regime in place today at any point time. So that does continue to 
be on a transitional basis. Over time, yo
u'll see a reduction in some of the 
phased introductions.
 
So it will change over time, and more of that parent capital would be 
allocated across the businesses, but more of it going to ISG over time. But 
of course, that's a couple year period on the phase 
in.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Got it. Okay. Thanks very much for taking the questions and obviously for 
your service and your tremendous clarity of vision and explanation of 
everything over the last several years. We've appreciated working with you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank 
you very much.
 
Operator
 
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi. First question for James. You have a 10% ROE target. You certainly 
achieved that in the first quarter. What is your target time frame to achieve 
the 10% ROE f
or the year?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, Mike, first of all, appreciate you noting the first quarter. We have, as 
you know, resisted giving you a formal time frame because obviously, the 
ROE is an output and it's a function of returns, both revenue and expenses, 
as
 
well as it is of capital accretive over time and what our capital plans are. 
So we have resisted trying to put a formal date on it.
 
I can assure you everybody in this building would want it sooner rather than 
later. And the fact that we achieved it in a g
ood environment but not an 
extraordinary environment in the first quarter and before many of the 
tailwinds that we have behind us are fully baked in, was very comforting.
 
We're not going to give you a formal date on this. We are intent on 
achieving a 10% R
OE year over year and beyond that in the outgoing years. 
So we're off to a good start here in 2015, and let's hope we keep it up.
 
Mike Mayo
 
What is the 10.1% on a tangible basis?
 
James Gorman
 
It's 11.9, is that right Ruth?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes it is. 
Various numbers are we reported 14.2% translates to 16.6% on 
tangible. And so adjusting up for DVA and discrete tax benefits, equivalent 
ROTE rate of 11.9%.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And then a separate question. Your VaR stayed flatten from the fourth 
quarter when your V
aR peers actually went up. What's your thought process 
there, did you leave money on the table, is that a lower risk profile? What's 
going on?

So, VaR is heavily weighted to changes in current market volatility. And as 
you know our VaR was flat,
 
but what we're focused on is our VaR was flat on 
performance. We were very active with clients. We were able to achieve VaR 
efficiency. We reduced balance sheet in certain areas that were less 
constructive. We reallocated by client activity.
 
We have capac
ity to take VaR up. But you can see in the results, we had 
strong performance with flat VaR.
 
James Gorman
 
I think the key to this is we did not dial up risk to generate these earnings. 
Whether we left money on the table if things had turned out differently
, 
some people might have said we left losses on the table. In this situation, 
we didn't dial up the risk. We delivered the earnings.
 
But obviously we have a very successful trading business in parts of this 
firm. And they will react to the market volatilit
y as I said.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And then lastly, Ruth, you're yet one more banking executive to lead the 
industry. Any last comment about the regulation in the banking industry?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, I think that fundamental regulatory change was needed with the 
backdro
p of 2008, and it was implemented. And I think there's been 
meaningful improvement in the stability and resiliency of the industry as a 
result with all that's been done. The higher capital levels, liquidity stress 
testing, recovery plans, resolution plans,
 
governance 
--
 
all the changes in 
business activity.
 
I think if I look back over the last five years, some made those changes 
kicking and screaming. I think we were of the view that it was clear where it 
was going and it was needed and are proud of the cha
nges we've made.
 
I think at this point given how much has been accomplished, it is time to 
pause, digest and assess. It will be good to have a timeout and see the 
impact on markets and see where there was an undershoot and an 
overshoot. And hopefully that'
s what we see going forward.
 
I think the main point is the industry is substantially more resilient, and 
that's a big accomplishment. It's a lot of work to get here for all of us. It 
may mean lower returns but it means a more resilient industry; and that's
 
a 
positive place to be.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thanks. Ruth, you mentioned in your commentary on SIC about structure 
transactions being a 
contributor. I'm curious if that is only in commodities or 
if that was in other parts of the business and how big of a driver. And more 
importantly is that a sustainable appetite by clients, because we've all been 
waiting for that for a while.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I
'm glad you asked that. It was a comment specific to commodities. In 
commodities, it was a combination of structured activity, the physical and 
trading activity. The majority of client facing flow in structured business, it 
was in the backdrop of what's go
ne on in the oil markets, it was good to see 
the volume of structured transactions. But as I said, I'm not going to do a 
forecast on.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. And does that mean 

 
I don't want to put words in your mouth, but 
was the commodities 
contribution of the quarter larger than normal times 
just because of some of the things you mentioned plus the weather?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, commodities as you know well, is stronger in the first quarter. And so 
it was up some versus last quarter. But the bigg
er driver was the strength in 
macro with rates and foreign exchange up nicely year over year.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay, cool. And then RWA down 4% for the firm sequentially, I think you 
said 6% in SIC. It's good; it's welcome. Is that not a number that we want 
to
 
straightline, right?
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
Glenn Schorr
 
Can it fall at that pace on an annualized basis?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, two parts to that question. At 6% sync [ph] I noted that it's down to 
$174 billion; and we're retaining the target at $180 billion. We're very 
focused on RWA efficiency, and we've indicated there's another $25 billion 
that runs off post 2015.
 
And we're
 
going to be very clinical and flexible in the way we allocate that 
capital across the franchise in a way that optimizes returns. But to your 
question, would we want you to straight line from there, I think I've 
answered that.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Cool. Last one, 
easy one, share count was flat year on year, but you got a 
higher authorization. That's just math, right? We can count on maybe 2% 
shrinkage this year in the share count?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, the main thing is we got a higher authorization and that we start 
exe
cuting on the share repurchase as we come out of the second quarter. 
And we expect to execute that radically over the time period.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Thanks for everything, Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you very much.
 
Operator
 
Your next question is from the line of Bre
nnan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. Couple of quick ones here. Cap Markets, the equity strength. 
How much of that, I know you highlighted across regions, and you gave 
some great color, Ruth, on some of the various components.
 
How much of a t
ailwind was Europe this quarter, just given some of the 
strength and on the back of QE there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well as we've talked about on many quarters, we run the business with a 
nine box strategy product across the top cash derivatives in PB and then 
region
s, Americas, EMEA and Asia. In the first quarter, every box was 
strong. The big theme, as I said, was increased investor interest outside of 
the US, and particularly US investors in the rest of the world.
 
We clearly saw a pick up in client engagement in th
e EU on the back of the 
CB actions, but we also saw cash share gains in Asia with a pickup in client 
activity on the Asia growth opportunity and relative value there. We had nice 
frets to the business.
 
The key question is the ongoing macro 
backdrop, as I said, and the nature of 
volatility. This quarter was characterized by LV trending volatility and a lot 
worked well. It was the best quarter in a long time. Looking forward, we'd 
anchor the outlook to what we've see over the last few years. B
ut there 
were a lot of good things going on around the globe.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. Thanks for that color. And then thinking about Wealth Management 
here, can you give maybe a little color? It's early, but on any potential 
impact from the Department of Labo
r proposal?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, respect to the DOL proposal, it's still in the comment period' there are a 
number of open items to address. Based on our best interpretation of the 
proposal at this point, we don't expect a meaningful impact on our business. 
We d
o expect some changes in activity, and we do expect more compliance
-
related costs.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. And then I know the loan growth environment is sort of tough. But 
sequential loan growth slowed somewhat, and it looked like PLA slowed 
more than mortga
ge. Was there anything driving that, and should we 
ratchet down expectations for loan growth? Or was that more sort of like a 
single quarter type of a slowdown there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. Loan growth is still very much on plan, consistent with what James 
went t
hrough on the fourth quarter. We talked a lot about prudent loan 
grow. There is some seasonality with PLA in mortgages in the first quarter.
 
But we have a healthy and diversified pipeline and expect it to continue to 
deliver steady prudent loan growth. The
 
main point to talk about is two 
sizable franchises with diversified assets. We have ample opportunities for 
loan growth.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Terrific. Last one from me. Any chance to quantify the legal charge in both 
overall firm and in the securities business
?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, we commented that non
-
comp expense was up a bit here due in part to 
legal; but we're not breaking it out.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay.
 
James Gorman
 
The main takeaway on that is that the big legal stuff relating to the crisis we 
feel is behind us. 
We are dealing with some of the one
-
off smaller events as 
we move forward here.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Thanks for that, James. Congrats to you, Ruth. Best of luck on your switch 
over to the left coast there.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you very much.
 
Operator
 
Your next quest
ion is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America/Merrill Lynch.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Ruth, one more on equities. And not really focused on the quarter but if I 
look over the last four or six quarters, it seems like the traction of the 
progress has j
ust been continuous. And it's been pretty consistent across 
products, across geographies.
 
I just want to get a sense, when you look at what's going on in the equity 
business and when you look at some of the pressures on the business and 
on the regulatory e
nvironment with clients, are you seeing more market 
share in areas where you guys are differentiating versus the customers or 
versus competitors?
 
And is there any nuance between the high touch, the low touch or anything 
else? It just seems like the consist
ency in the traction has been very 
consistent across the past two years.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we are of the view, and I've talked about this on prior calls, of the view 
that we're benefiting from a lot of investments in the business over many 
years. So it's 
back to early technology investments in the business that 
enable us to execute on behalf of clients in all market environments and do 
so on a cost efficient basis, where we're driving returns for stakeholders as 
well.
 
It goes to the quality and content of 
the team, so that it very much is high 
tech, high touch and the breadth of the franchise. Talk about the nine box 
strategy because it's so core to way the team runs it, and with this maniacal 
focus within each box.
 
But then as we talked about over many yea
rs now, a focus on what are the 
adjacencies, so that has we go deeper with clients in certain areas they go 
deeper with us. It is a very tightly run business, but its delivering results.
 
James Gorman
 
I'd just add to that, Mike, that remember coming out of 
the financial crisis 
our prime brokerage business clearly took a hit. And that is being rebuilt. I 
think over time, essentially gained share. The strength of that business has 
been a real additive.
 
And secondly, these businesses do well in a large part bec
ause of the quality 
of the leadership team running them. And we've had a very stable and 
strong, deep leadership team running now [ph] these business for several 
years, and I think that makes a difference.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay. That's helpful. You have set
 
out the ROE target, and you hit around 
that area this quarter. And, James, it sounds like when you talked about 
dialing up the risk, it wasn't one of those quarters where everything worked. 
There was obviously good progress, but it could've been better.
 
I
 
just want to get a sense of when you guys look at some of the things that 
can improve in terms of the Wealth Management pretax margin, things that 
you have control of, it still seems a little surprising when I think about a 
10% ROE and then I look at your
 
business. 20% is fixed income, and then 
80% is equities, banking and wealth management and investment 
management. Things that we generally think of a higher ROE.
 
When I think about going over the next couple quarters, years, besides the 
things that you ha
ve control of, are there other things on the capital side or 
the balance sheet side that will continue to boost that ROE?
 
I know the ROTE is higher; it's around 12% versus the 10%. I just wanted 
to get your sense on what will be the drivers to improve that
, besides the 
margin in the wealth management business.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, let me take a cut at that, and I'm sure Ruth will add on. Firstly, I think 
a lot of folks really haven't given much attention to the E part of this 
equation. When we started as a te
am five years ago, our E was around $40 
billion; it's now around $68 billion, I think. So if we were still operating with 
the same equity we had five years ago, our ROE would actually be in the 
order of magnitude of 15%, our ROET well above that.
 
So we've 
been through a major repositioning of this firm in the regulatory 
environment. The key has been to put ourselves in a position where we had 
enough capital, where we wouldn't be going, needing to go out and raise 
capital, accrete excess capital and so on. A
nd ultimately, the test of that 
would be successful CCAR capital distributions.
 
We've now had three years where we've lifted our dividend from $0.20 to 
$0.40, now $0.60 a year. Lifted our buyback from 500 to 1 billion to now 2.5 
billion, and we expect to i
ncrease capital actions in the years ahead. The E 
part of this equation, I think, deserves a little bit of attention.
 
On the R side, two things are going on. One, we have a very, very focused 
non
-
comp expense program we've had in process for a few years, w
hich has 
a huge team here, led by Charlie Chasen here. They are very focused on 
that. We're not going to let go or let hold of the non
-
comp side.
 
And on the comps side, it's pretty clear. We said the ISG comp to revenue 
ratio would be below 40%, and indeed
 
it was. And we're bringing down the 
comp to revenue ratio for the other businesses as we build scale.
 
Then you look at where the opportunities are, and they are many, frankly. 
We're not yet in a global economy which is by any means robust. The Wealth 
Mana
gement full transition to the managed product hasn't yet occurred. The 
bank loan products, we've still got tremendous capacity there. We haven't 
seen the interest rate hike, which we're going to get at some point in the 
future.
 
The M&A and ECM businesses c
learly will pick up as the global economies 
pickup, and I could go on with a long list. I'm giving a long answer because 
it's a complicated, multifaceted thing.
 
But I would look at all of those, starting with the move to non
-
comp, the 
comp to revenue commi
tments, capital plans and then follow with the 
particular revenue drivers in each of the businesses that exist today and are 
likely to exist in the changing, high rate environment going forward.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay. Makes sense. Thanks a lot.
 
James Gorman
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
And your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth.
 
James Gorman
 
Morning.
 
Christian Bolu
 
James, on the regulatory environment, the SEC seems to be 
focused on the 
potential abuse of fee
-
based accounts, so
-
called reverse churning. Given 
Morgan Stanley's fee
-
based accounts have more than doubled since 2009, 
I'd be curious as to what kind of controls or checks you have in place to 
ensure the proper use o
f fee
-
based accounts at Morgan Stanley
 
James Gorman
 
Well, this is one of those questions which, depending on the environment, 
you could ask it one way or the other. A lot of people spend their time 
complaining about the churning on transaction type account
s, which is why 
the fee
-
based industry has really evolved. Where clients, certain clients, 
have wanted the certainty of knowing they pay one fee, and with that they 
either do none or as much transaction activity as they want to do. So it 
seems to me it wou
ld be a very natural market segmentation.
 
There will be some clients for example, people with large restricted stock 
positions, which that would probably not be something they want to do. But 
from many others who want a more advice driven relationship, it 
obviously 
is. Whether its transaction activity or fee
-
based activity, we have an 
enormous compliance operation in our wealth management division, driven 
down to the branch level.
 
Both at the personal touch level and also at the model
-
driven level, where 
we
 
look for exceptions, which looks at suitability, concentration risk and all 
the other things that you would expect to make sure that the clients are 
properly served at the pricing that they're getting.
 
Christian Bolu
 

e tax strategy. I think tax benefit 
seems to be recurrent theme quarter after quarter. At a very high level, 
could you explain the firm's tax strategy and how we should conceptually 
think about any tax benefits going forward.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, this quarter 
was the result of a legal entity simplification consistent 
with resolution. We would still guide you to around 30% as the effective tax 
rate on a go
-
forward basis.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay, there's no wide tax strategy or anything in that nature we should 
think
 
about?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. As I said, this was legal entity simplification; and I guide you at 30%.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. A couple of cleanup questions. On the M&A backlog, I believe you said 
it was up year over year. How does a look on a link quarter basis?
 
Ru
th Porat
 
It is up year
-
over
-
year and that is the way we've been looking at it.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. And then on the funding cost benefits, how should we think about the 
allocation between FIC and equities?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, as we've talked about a 
number of calls, we allocate funding, balance 
sheet, liquidity based down to the product level. And it's really based on the 
asset mix, and so that's the real driver of it.
 
We haven't broken that out, but it's going to benefit across sales and 
trading. And
 
it's a nice tailwind that is increasingly building through 2016 
year.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. Thank you. And just lastly, like the sentiments of my peers, it's been 
a pleasure working with you, Ruth. You're definitely going to be missed.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you very much.
 
Christian Bolu

Operator
 
And your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Certainly pleased to see the ISG comp
 
leverage really show through in the 
quarter in light of the revenue strength. I was just wondering how we should 
think about the comp leverage versus the full
-
year target of 39%, assuming 
you can actually deliver revenue growth for the full year?
 
Ruth Por
at
 
So when we set the comp ratio, it's with a full
-
year outlook. So the 38% is 
the full
-
year outlook. Again, that's all things equal. That's the way it's set.
 
We remain very committed to rewarding those who drive returns. And we 
think with the steps we've 
taken on comp structure and the operating 
leverage in the business, this is a full
-
year outlook 
--
 
again, all things equal.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Okay. And then maybe switching over to the capital side for a moment. 
We're certainly pleased to see the significant b
uild in the leverage ratio in 
the quarter. When parsing the individual components of that ratio, it looks 
like the improvement was really driven by a reduction in SLR add
-
ons more 
so than anything else.
 
And I was just wondering if you could speak to what t
he current level is of 
those SLR add
-
ons, and maybe how we should be thinking about sources of 
future mitigation potential.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well from the benefit this quarter was really both numerator and 
denominator. You're absolutely right; in the denominator
, we have work 
streams against all the various gross ups, and we had reductions in net long 
CDS sold.
 
And we're benefiting from compression activity, which I would say industry 
wide has become more business as usual, which we think is a real positive.
 
We w
ere early on that, and it's good to see it has been broadly embraced. 
The numerator clearly benefited from earnings in our preferred issuance 
early in the quarter. So we remain focused on all of the items that are 
possible and logical for mitigation.
 
Compr
ession, as I said, but across the board, remain focused on ensuring 
that if we're using balance sheet, where we're using balance sheet. It 
continues to provide the kind of returns commensurate with the capital 
that's being required here. And so it's, again
, a deep focus; but it's both a 
numerator and a denominator benefit.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Okay. Thanks, Ruth. And then just lastly on the Wealth Management side 
and specifically the new long
-
term deposit target of $200 billion, which Greg 
spoke to at a recent inv
estor conference. In the past you've highlighted 
some metrics where maybe your under penetrated relative to peers to help 
drive future growth.
 
And was hoping, in the context of this specific target, whether you could 
highlight any specific metrics which wo
uld support that additional growth 
towards that $200 billion.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, we've talked about, I say it so often, I'm sure you're tired of hearing it, 
but we're focused on prudent loan growth across both wealth management 
and institutional securities. 
We do believe we have meaningful upside from 
here, given the scale of the client base and the relative penetration, in 
particular in wealth management. We've talked about that. The $200 billion 
deposit target is really married to our expected loan demand o
ver the next 
several years.
 
And so the execution plan on deposit growth, as we looked at what is the 
loan potential given these two large franchises, the expectation for deposit 
growth was two phases. The contractual on boarding from city, and as I 
think y
ou know, that ends this quarter, the second quarter of 2015, but we 
are in an excess deposit position.
 
Our loan to deposit ratio is at 51%. And even if we load in standby liquidity 
to support loans, the ratio is at 74%. So we do have a nice runway before 
w
e need additional deposits to support loan growth.
 
And then as we've talked about on the fourth
-
quarter call and as Greg 
commented on, we have substantial organic deposit growth opportunity 
given our client base. We still have a large portion of cash 
held away.
 
But it's really calculated with a lens to what is the loan growth opportunity 
across Wealth Management and institutional securities. And we see quite of 
bit of opportunity from here against which we will execute over time, 
prudently, leading wit
h credit risk management.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Okay. Thanks, Ruth. That's really helpful. And congrats on the new role and 
best of luck at future opportunity.

Operator
 
Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Connor with De
utsche 
Bank.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
You had mentioned earlier about long
-
term debt cost coming down and I 
think implied you're still early on in that process. Maybe if you could just size 
how much benefit you've had so far from that and 
try and shape how much 
opportunity is still in front of us.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, as we indicated from peak financing costs to end of 2016, it's down 
about 25%. And the benefit comes in as we refinance debt that was issued 
post crisis, given our credit spreads 
are meaningfully tighter. And so as we 
see more of that we refinance, the greater the benefits. That's why it lags in 
over time.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
And do you have what the blended rate of your long
-
term debt is, the $155 
billion?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I don't have tha
t with me.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
Okay.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It's in the filings, I don't have it with me.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
Okay. But just I mean, conceptually, are we halfway through 
-
 
your spreads 
have been coming in quite a bit, market rates have been coming down, even
 
just the past year here so. I think there's still additional opportunity to bring 
those rates down.
 
Ruth Porat
 
There is a decent opportunity. Some of the debt that we refinanced was put 
on pre
-
crisis, and so we've only recently begun to tap into that port
ion of it 
that was put on post crisis. At a certain point, it was actually more of a 
headwind.
 
It's been turning recently to become a tailwind, and that's why we called it 
out when we did. We delayed to call it out and at the point at which we were 
startin
g, not to refinance the early 2000 debt, but what was put on post 
crisis. That's why it's a delayed benefit here. Delayed posts are the 
contraction we've seen in our credit spreads.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
Okay. That makes sense. All right, thank you.
 
Ruth 
Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham 
Research.
 
James Mitchell
 
Hey, good morning. Just maybe a follow
-
up on the capital question. You are 
substantially above on your common equity tier 1 ratio; but on
 
the SLR, 
you're just slightly above the minimum. How do you think about the 
interplay of the leverage versus the common equity, to a point where you 
can start to return even more of the common equity to maximize returns?
 
Is there a lot more to go on the d
enominator in the leverage ratio, or does it 
mean potentially more preferred to maximize shareholder returns? How do 
you think about that dynamic over time, and what kind of a cushion do you 
think you need on the SLR?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, I've already answered p
art of it in response to an earlier question which 
is, we've talked frequently about the way to maximize return and capital 
over the longer term is to have steady increases. No discontinuous moves in 
the request for return of capital.
 
And we're very please
d to have the ability this year, at the $3.1 billion share 
repurchase over the five quarter period and the dividends up 50%. So when 
we look at the requirement, there are clearly a number of them. Interest 
rate capital, it's SLR, it's the CCAR process itse
lf, it's how you think about 
the stress losses.
 
SLR obviously was not in CCAR in the last round. But we have a forward
-
looking lens as we think about the business, where we consider all of those 
factors. And as we looked to optimize the opportunity across 
the franchise, 
both from a returns perspective and the ability to return capital, we look 
through each one of those lenses.
 
At this point though, as I said, SLR hasn't been included in the CCAR that 
would govern how much we can return. But that obviously h
asn't stopped us 
implementing strong work streams to mitigate the gross up in the 
denominator, as we've already talked about on this call.
 
We look at all. You have to look at all; you can't just tip to one versus the 
other. Again, it's with a lens that we 
want to ensure we're providing balance 
sheet capital behind client activity and doing it in the most constructive way. 
But it's complicated. There's no question with the multiplicity of 
requirements. But that's what we've been managing against.
 
James Mitch
ell
 
So hear but on the CCAR, your constraining factors were more of the tier 1 
ratio's, right, the leverage the total capital? So I'm just trying to get a sense. 
Do you think there's a lot more to do on the denominator side or do you 
think it would make mo
re sense to issue more preferred to deal with that? 
Or do you think you have enough time to make more efficiencies on the 
balance sheet side? That's what I'm just trying to get at
 
Ruth Porat
 
Okay, sorry. On that, part of it is the CCAR process itself. We w
ere pleased 
this year that on one input to the overall calculation, PP&R, the estimate by 
the Federal Reserve increased. We believe that reflects the greater 
consistency we have in earnings. We put a lot of effort behind trying to 
clarify that, and we're p
leased that it picked up.
 
And when you look at what were some of the things that took the total 
capital calculation lower, the leverage lower, there was a difference between 
estimates firm and Federal Reserve on balance sheet growth or RWAs over 
the period
. And our view is that the test is a learning process, even though 
there's not that much transparency in it and that it's really about addressing 
some of those elements of it.
 
So that's one component, trying to narrow the gap between the Federal 
Reserve's 
estimate and the firm's estimate on things like balance sheet 
growth. You know, is the fair value firm and we don't see that kind of 
balance sheet growth.
 
And then on the second part of it, of course ensuring we are being very 
clinical and direct on balanc
e sheet use in other elements of it. We look at all 
preferred and sub debt as ways to optimize capital over time, and we'll 
continue to do so. We've been doing that for the last couple of years.
 
James Gorman
 
Just think about where we've come from. The SLR,
 
we're at about 4.2%; a 
year ago, we were at 5.1%. With some of the actions we took, we 
intentionally depleted our capital in the last several months, including the 
charge relating to the Attorney General action, Department of Justice, and 
the charge relat
ed to our deferrals.
 
The good news is we're above 5% now. We have several years to stave up 
5%. We have several years to work the balance sheet and, as necessary, 
use preferred securities. So we have a long runway to keep this in motion, 
and we're pretty c
onfident we can stay above 5% and do the things that 
Ruth talked about.
 
James Mitchell
 
Absolutely. Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Just a couple quick follow ups here. So on the bank and 
strong loan demand, 
is it reasonable to think that you could skew more towards loans than you 
presented? I think you've given roughly 60% loans as a percent of assets by 
2016 end. Is that the optimal mix; or, if the demand is there, could we see 
that mix l
ook more lending heavy?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Just 13 weeks ago, James refreshed our outlook on the six
-
point plan and 
provided we added another year on the bank outlook to give you a sense of 
the asset mix. And the real point of doing that was so that you could mode
l, 
when you expect a rate increase. We're giving you our outlook on asset mix, 
and there's no updates there on what was reviewed last quarter.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay. All right, great. And then just coming back to the strength in EMEA in 
the quarter. It sounds li
ke that was more trading heavy in the trading 
businesses. Were there any specific areas that really experienced 
improvement? Does that tone of activity still feel good, and do you see that 
spilling into other businesses?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I've indicated it was 
in both equities and in fixed income in macro products. 
But as I noted, it was not just Europe. We saw a focus on the opportunity in 
Asia as well. It's an early start to the quarter here. As we typically say at 
this point, a couple of weeks is not a quarte
r.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay. Thanks very much.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo 
Securities.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ruth, I wanted to focus one 
more question on the
 
debt opportunity and specifically on the legacy trust to 
preferreds that you have outstanding.
 
I think your plan previously was to potentially redeem most, if not all, of 
those this year. I'm wondering what the timing is on that based on your 
CCAR results
 
this past go around?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We did include the redemption of trust in CCAR because it's expensive 
relative to where it stands today. The rules are complicated, but we do 
remain focused on eliminating the drag. That was the piece we withdrew. We 
did no
t change our requested return of capital. The $3.1 billion share 
repurchase and the dividend increase of 50% weren't altered. And we're 
pleased to attest qualitatively.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Okay. And then just in terms of investment banking trends, obviously very 
strong quarter across the franchise in trading. To James's earlier point, 
you're not hitting on all cylinders, and banking within ISG was a little bit less 
strong.
 
Can you give us some color as to your outlook as to the potential 
opportunities or strengths
 
within EMEA and Asia, specifically within the 
banking business?
 
James Gorman
 
I think firstly, just looking at the banking franchise, it's a terrific franchise. 
We actually had a strong quarter; some others had very strong quarters, all 
power to them. We h
ave a good pipeline. Obviously, it's a lumpier business 
in any 13
-
week period than some of the other businesses, so you're going to 
expect a little more bouncing around. No concerns there.
 
We are seeing a pickup in Europe. Asia has been slow. Japan was a l
ittle 
slow earlier in the year, but we're starting to see some cross
-
border activity 
there. Well
-
positioned strong franchises in Japan and China. So I think the 
outlook remains very firm.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Okay. Thanks very much.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
James Gorman
 
I think that brings this call to an end. I just wanted to take a moment to 
thank our dear friend Ruth, wish her well. I'm also sorry to see the analysts 
are now moving to the West Coast, following her. We'll have to pick up some 
others over he
re.
 
But on a more serious note, she's been a great partner. Has sat in the office 
next to me for five years, and done a terrific job in helping get this firm back 
from the depths of the financial crisis. And it takes a great team. Ruth had a 
great team wor
king with her. She followed also a terrific CFO, who helped us 
navigate the crisis during extraordinarily stressful period, Tom Kelleher. And 
she now precedes another new CFO, as I said John Pruzan, who I think will 
also be terrific.
 
And throughout it all,
 
we've had a deputy CFO that many of you have not 
heard on these calls, but has been in many of the meetings. Paul Wirth has 
been an extraordinary able and steady hand now through the last three 
CFOs we've had at this firm, so great team. Thank you Ruth. W
e wish you 
well. And don't forget us.
 
We're going to leave Ruth with something to remind her of Morgan Stanley, 
not that she would ever forget us. But we wish her the best. Thanks, 
everybody, for a good call.

4/19/18,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During 
today's presentation, we'll refer to our earnings release and financial 
supplement. Copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's 
presentation may include 
forward
-
looking statements that are subject to 
risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. 
Please refer to our notices regarding forward
-
looking statements and non

GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This pres
entation may 
not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.
 
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2019 has started well. In 
the first 
quarter, our business has produced solid results and rebounded 
from the fourth quarter's market dislocation and idiosyncratic events. In our 
Institutional businesses, client participation and balances steadily improved 
alongside confidence and asset prices
. While activity was not as robust as 
early 2018, the improvement in sentiment, CEO dialogue and boardroom 
conversations were all encouraging.
 
Our Wealth business absorbed lower fourth quarter asset levels and 
delivered strong results. The margin demonstra
ted the business' ability to 
withstand shocks to asset values. In Investment Management, we've posted 
very strong investment results, particularly in private real assets and private 
equity. Broad client relationships have driven net inflows in our global e
quity 
strategies, where long
-
term performance continues to attract investors.
 
We remain confident in the firm's outlook and broader economic activity, but 
we're cognizant that global risk more balanced. Against this backdrop, we 
remained very focused on ex
pense discipline, while it's still investing for 
growth. This focus is evident in the results. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, total 
non
-
interest expenses declined 4%, even as we continued our investments.
 
Across the board, ROE, ROTCE, the firm efficiency ratio
 
and Wealth 
Management margin are in line with or at the higher end of our strategic 
objectives, ensuring a very solid start of the year.
 
Consistent with our objective to investment growth, we announced our 
intent to acquire Solium Capital, a leading globa
l software provider for equity 
administration, financial reporting and compliance. This transaction will 
enable us to bring together a major stock plan administration platform with 
the leading wealth management business, positioning us to be a top tier 
pro
vider in the workplace wealth space. Through Solium, we gained a new 
scalable channel and direct sales force getting us the ability to target 
another client population, particularly a younger demographic and its wealth 
accumulation phase.
 
On a combined bas
is, we will now have direct exposure over 2.5 million 
individuals by Solium's workplace services, complimenting the other three 
million wealth management clients, our financial advisors already served in 
our traditional business. What excites us is the exp
ansion into the 
workplace? Delivering financial wellness services to clients and offering 
financial advice, education and the ability to transact through their 
employer. This deal is aligned with our strategic objective to round out our 
product offerings w
ith complimentary bolt
-
on acquisitions. And we will 
continue to look for similar opportunities.
 
We recently announced that Colm Kelleher would be retiring from the firm 
effective June 30
th
. As all of you know Colm was the Chief Financial Officer 
during the
 
global financial crisis and was critical in helping navigate the firm 
through those challenging times. Over the course of his study and career, 
Colm has served in a number of important roles across our businesses, most 
recently as President of the firm. I
'm extremely grateful to Colm for his 
contributions. And it has been a great privilege to call him my partner for the 
past decade. As we move forward, the Board and I very focused on long
-
term development of our management team.
 
So now, I would turn the ca
ll over to Jon to discuss this quarter in greater 
detail. Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you and good morning. January opened with fragile sentiment and 
lackluster conviction, while we witnessed a gradual improvement as the first 
quarter progress signs o
f the December hangover and the U.S. government 
shutdown were evident. Clients took time to regain confidence, and industry 
volumes declined impacting our ISG businesses.
 
Lower asset values at the end of 4Q impacted Wealth Management and 
Investment Managem
ent fee revenues. Still, the firm produced solid results. 
Revenues of $10.3 billion declined only 7% year
-
over
-
year compared against 
the strongest quarter in the firm's history ex
-
DVA. On a sequential basis 
revenues increased 20%. PBT was $3 billion and EP
S was $1.39.
 
The firm delivered returns at the high
-
end of our target ranges with an ROE 
of 13.1 and ROTCE of 14.9. We continued to focus on expenses while 
investing in the business. Total non
-
interest expense was $7.3 billion, down 
4% from 1Q '18. We rema
ined committed to funding investments to tight 
focus on our more controllable expenses such as marketing and business 
development and professional services. The firm's non
-
compensation 
expenses were down 2% year
-
over
-
year despite elevated Brexit
-
related 
ex
penses and ongoing investment and technology.
 
Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities generated revenues of $5.2 
billion in the first quarter, a 35% sequential increase. EMEA rebounded 
nicely, and Asia also demonstrated strength. We saw client acti
vity and 
engagement gain momentum in the back half of the quarter.
 
Non compensation expenses were $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 3% decline 
from the prior year.
 
Compensation expenses were $1.8 billion, resulting in compensation to net 
revenue ratio of 35%
, consistent with last year's ratio.
 
In Investment Banking, we generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a 19% 
increase relative to the fourth quarter, after a slow start momentum and 
confidence picked up.
 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $406 million, dow
n 45% 
sequentially. Completed M&A volumes declined 38% relative to an active 
fourth quarter. Importantly, there has been a pickup in activity levels, and 
pipelines are healthy.
 
Turning to underwriting, new issue market conditions were more challenged 
at th
e outset, but issuance built momentum as the quarter progressed. Our 
equity underwriting franchise remained strong. Revenues of $339 million 
were up 5% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. The sequential strength in blocks, follow
-
ons and convertibles offset weak IPO rev
enue. IPO volumes witnessed a 
short sequence of decline of 79%. Many issuers were sidelined by the U.S. 
government shutdown.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 13% sequentially to $406 
million. We saw an increase in bond issuance volumes across i
nvestment
-
grade and high
-
yield, while our leveraged loan activity remained muted.
 
Overall Investment Banking pipelines remained healthy and diversified 
across products, regions and sectors. CEOs remain engaged the global 
equity pipeline has built through t
he quarter, particularly IPOs, and market 
volatility is subdued.
 
However, as demonstrated by recent market dynamics, future activity may 
be impacted by macro economic uncertainty and geopolitical events.
 
In equities, we retained our leadership position and
 
expect to be number one 
globally. Revenues were $2 billion, declining 21% year
-
over
-
year and 
increasing 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. On a sequential basis, derivatives and 
cash revenues improved with derivatives benefiting from improved markets 
and corporate 
activity.
 
In prime brokerage, sequential and year
-
over
-
year revenue declines were 
driven by lower average balances. Clients gradually relevered and balances 
partially recovered over the course of the quarter and continue to build. 
While market indices have
 
rallied materially and sentiment has improved, 
clients remain cautious.
 
First quarter fixed income results were strong following the traditional 
seasonal pattern. Revenues in 1Q were $1.7 billion, more than doubling 
weak fourth quarter results. Overall, c
lient activity improved over the 
quarter. The market was generally characterized by tightening credit 
spreads, declining interest rates, low volatility and uneven client activity 
across business lines as well as benefits from structured client activity.
 
Ma
cro rebounded broadly on a quarter
-
over
-
quarter basis. Compared to 
prior year, our macro performance reflected dampened volatility impacting 
structure rates and FX. Macro investors remain sideline lack in conviction 
and awaiting clarity around Central Bank
 
policy, Brexit and U.S.
-
China 
relationship.
 
Micro results were robust both sequentially and annually, driven by 
particular strength in corporate credit. Tightening credit spreads and 
increased secondary trading activity resulted in higher client 
revenues. We 
saw increased velocity over the balance sheet in the quarter Commodities 
had strong broad base results with solid trading performance and lower 
structured revenues in Q1 '18.
 
Wealth Management reported quarterly revenues of $4.4 billion and pr
e
-
tax 
profit at $1.2 billion. Despite lower starting asset levels, the business 
produced the PBT margin of 27.1% demonstrating resilience despite large 
market drawdowns in the fourth quarter.
 
Total client assets ended the quarter at $2.5 trillion, an 8% in
crease versus 
the prior quarter, reflecting positive asset flows to the firm and the rebound 
in asset prices. Net fee
-
based asset flows were $15 billion, and additionally, 
we continue to see improvement in the productivity of our advisers.
 
Transactional re
venues were $817 million. Movements in deferred 
compensation to investments were significantly impacted fourth quarter 
revenues, partly reversed in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the 
gains on the plans, transactional revenues were down slightly
 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Revenues were impacted by client's defensive posture and the 
relatively slow syndicate calendar.
 
In particular, we witnessed a rotation out of equities into short
-
term fixed 
income products. Asset management revenues were $2.4 billio
n. The 8% 
decline from the prior quarter was primarily driven by last quarter's lower 
ending asset levels. Total bank lending ended the quarter at $71.5 billion. 
While funded balances declined slightly quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven by a 
handful of large pay
 
downs in the tailored lending book and a modest decline 
and security
-
based lending, commitments did rise. The rise in commitments 
and solid mortgage growth over the quarter are encouraging and we 
continue to expect mid single
-
digit percentage loan balance
 
growth for the 
full year.
 
Net interest income growth of 3% to $1.1 billion was primarily driven by the 
benefit of the December rate increase and the corresponding impact on our 
investment portfolio yields. Additionally, we benefited from the increased 
lev
el of deposits at the beginning of the quarter, which was partially offset 
by higher prepayments fees.
 
Strong non
-
compensation expense discipline and the benefit of the retention 
note roll
-
off more than offset the effect of lower asset values, resulting in
 
a 
margin of 27.1%. As demonstrated during the quarter, we have leveraged to 
protect the margin, while still investing for growth.
 
Investment Management produced very strong results. Revenues of $804 
million were up 18% sequentially and were the highest fo
r the segment in 
over five years. This was driven by $191 million of investment revenues.
 
Investment strength was broad based across products. The sequential 
increase was supported by the rebound in global markets and the absence of 
last quarter's impairme
nt charge. As noted historically, this line item has the 
potential to be lumpy.
 
Total AUM of $480 billion was up 4% versus the prior quarter with long
-
term 
AUM of $321 billion, increasing 7%. The increase in long
-
term AUM was 
primarily driven by strong mar
ket related growth.
 
Asset management fees of $617 million were down 2% sequentially. The 
higher management fees on the back of improved average AUM over the 
quarter were offset by lower performance fees. As we have mentioned 
before, as a result of the reve
nue recognition accounting rule implemented 
in 2018, a significant amount of any year's performance fees will be 
recognized in the fourth quarter with a small amount being recognized in 
this first quarter. Total expenses increased by 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarte
r, 
driven by higher carry compensation, which offset a decline in non
-
comp 
expenses.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets of $876 billion increased 3%, 
driven by client activity primarily in equity sales and trading and ISG 
lending. The higher b
alance sheet drove an increase in RWA is resulting in a 
decrease of our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to 16.5% from 16.9%. During 
the quarter we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common stock or 
approximately 28 million shares at $42, and our Board de
clared a $0.30 
dividend per share.
 
Our tax rate in the first quarter was 19.9 executing $101 million of 
intermittent net discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect our full year tax 
rate will be similar to the 2018 tax rate, excluding intermittent items.
 
The 
vast majority of our share based award conversions took place in the first 
quarter.
 
Markets in the second quarter had been constructive. Pipelines are healthy in 
Investment Banking, and higher asset levels will support fee
-
based revenues 
in our Wealth
 
Management business. We are keenly aware that open and 
functioning markets and economic stability are instrumental in supporting 
confidence and activity levels moving forward.
 
With that, we will now open the line for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
First question is on non
-
comp expense. We saw a pullback nicely here in the 
quarter. Can you help us think about
 
how we should think about the amount 
of flex that you haven't outlined to potentially offset environmental 
pressure? If we see that flaring up again that, maybe a bit of a context 
around fixed versus variable?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I'll take a shot. And a
s you said, we thought 
--
 
we had a nice quarter 
on the non
-
comp side. We continue to make investments. You'll see that in 
the IP and fee line in terms of technology. And where we've been able to 
tighten really has been in around marketing and business deve
lopment and 
professional services. We did see an uptick in Brexit expenses, but we were 
effectively able to self
-
fund those. And again, we continue to see 
opportunities and levers if needed, in those sort of more controllable, if you 
will, line items like 
marketing and business development and professional 
services. We did also see, as you would expect, year
-
over
-
year, a decline in 
some of the execution related expenses given the decline in revenues, but 
again, a nice quarter for us on the expense side, 71%
 
efficiency ratio, well 
below our target of 73.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
And then switching gears to Solium. James, I know you've referenced it and 
provided some high level context around how you're thinking about it 
strategically. But maybe 
--
 
could you help us thi
nk about how you see this 
fitting in a bit more granularity in the different businesses? My guess is it's 
primarily a wealth management, customer acquisition tool, potentially. But I 
would think that it might play in a bit on the banking side too, particul
arly in 
developing relationships with private. It comes along with fictional cash. So 
there seem to be a few different levers here that can help. Can you help us 
try to think about how you see those playing out after the deal closes and 
you onboard? What t
ype of a timeframe should we be thinking about before 
we can start to see some of these impacts? Is there a conversion that needs 
to happen? How 
--
 
could you help us a little with backing impact on around 
that? Thanks.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, I think, you have 
answered most Brennan. Thank you. Strategically 
this is pretty obvious to me. There are basically three ways to

three major

of advisory platform. Other is financial planners, advi
sors, et cetera. And we 
are

I would say, we're kind of A

plus in that zone. The second is through 

big established players there. And the third is through the workplace and

gh increasingly what's called financial wellness whether it's financial

I was growing up in 
Australia, I used to watching these ads on TV about picture time where he 
said he liked the razor so much and bought the company. So he went and 
bought the company. Well, we liked Solium so much when we outsourced to 

getting access to 2.5 million prospective clients by the way when their assets 
convert over from the stock plans they convert into 
--
 
they will be 
converting into Morgan Stanley acc
ounts. So that's a very part of the 
initiative.
 
The other part, as you pointed out, treasury functions, pension 
management, other forms of cash management, which we go through the 
Investment Management group. The private wealth and financial advisory 
teams
 
will continue to focus on C

Suite and senior executives. The IPO on 

in. And obviously, offer those services. So there are four, five ways into 
what is about, I think, it's about 
3,000 small companies they have on their 

very exciting relatively inexpensive, frankly, against the size of Morgan 

t obviously 
wasn't cheap on a notable basis. But I see it is buying the technology and 
giving its access to a new channel with notable verticals into it.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
And then just briefly on timing, we would expect the deal will close shortly. 
There is clearly some conversion and technology builds. And combining that 
will do probably as a 12 to 18 month type of conversion period. And then 
what expect to see the synergies that James talked about thereafter. So 
we're very excited about it.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. 
Your line is now open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Jon, you used a lot of additives saying the pipelines healthy, improved, and 
just one, if you can put some numbers on the backlog. And especially 
the 
IPO backlog, I mean, there's a lot of chatter in the market about the number 
of IPOs upcoming. And I guess you get more than your fair share in tech 

What's maybe little after th
e pipeline? What other period you compared this 
to?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I will try to give you a little bit more context. Although I think the additives 
were our attempt to give you that context. First and foremost, we're number 
one in global equity and IPOs. 

base franchise that we're very confident in. And as you know, given the sort 
of December hangover, the earnings season as well as the government 
shutdown, we did feel a significant portion of the IPO calendar 
gets pushed 
out, not canceled, but pushed out. We also then saw over the course of the 
quarter, increasing build up of the pipeline in the IPO product. So we feel 
very confident about our backlog, the health of the backlog and the size of 
the backlog. And 
right now, we do have a pretty constructive market in 
terms of equity vol and just overall evaluation. So assuming those markets 
stay opening and functioning, we feel very good about the ECM product and 
the ECM opportunity. This quarter, we had strength, r
eally we sort of pivoted 
to blocks and secondary's and converts. So a smaller number than general, 
but still a strong number relative to what the opportunity set was. And as I 
described, backlogs are healthy, and it's really going to depend on the 
markets 
openness and willingness to bring these deals from the pipeline into 
the market.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And then a separate question. Just on the Wealth Management margin, I 
mean, that's just going from 24% to 27%. It seems like there could be some 
one
-
time items or no
ise in that. I guess what's your outlook for that? And 
James, I know, I always ask this, but with the rebound the asset values, it 
seems like you sandbag with your pre
-
tax margin of 26%, 28%, now, 27% 
in the middle of that. But, why not raise that target? 
Where do you think 
that will be ahead? And was there any noise in this quarter?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, Mike, I think we're going to have this ongoing discussion probably for 
another decade. Let's see. I don't know that a midpoint result is a sandbag, 
but anywa
y, I will take that offline. Listen, the first quarter had 
--
 
there 
weren't any peculiar one
-
off things, and Jon will correct me if I'm wrong 
about that, but they weren't any. The business has scale. I mean, the 
bottom line, the business has scale of point
 
margin on $4.4 billion of 
revenues, $44 million. If you manage the expenses tightly, which the team 
did, they had decent activity in the secondary stuff, not great, but decent. 
They manage it tightly. You can move the needle quickly. And we 
--
 
there is 
no
 
--
 
I've been saying this for many, many years. This is the ultimate scale 
business. If you put down the railway tracks in the right way, it rolls. Every 
now and then, there's a little saying on the tracks which creates some 
friction, and every now and the
n you're going downhill, it goes a little faster. 
And that's 
--
 
the important thing is, the assets were priced at a very low 
level on December 31, relatively low level, and the business delivered 
notwithstanding. Now, as you know, we had two of the three m
onths 
included the benefit from the compensation deal running off, which ran off at 
the end of January. By the way, I haven't noticed any attrition resulting from 
that, which didn't expect, we didn't get. And we get three months of that 
coming into the sec
ond quarter. Assets priced more favorably in the second 
quarter. And we'll see how we do with expenses. But there's no magic to 
this. So it's pretty consistent. For a really bad quarter is 24.5% margin. We 
used to dream of having margins, which had 15% on 
them. So I'll take that 
as really bad quarter, and if a really good quarter surprises, the upside of 
the range. But we talked about the 26 to 28. So be it could happen.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I would just mention that the idiosyncratic events were really around t
he 
fourth quarter, not around the first quarter. So I think the fourth quarter 
was depressed by some of the things that we did. And the first quarter was 
just shows the benefit of scale and our ability to pull levers and sort of 
manage between growth and i
nvestment.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Your 
line is open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Question on just what to expect, even though you can't expect too much, on 
fixed seasonality in the first quarter, I'm sure is as str
ong as ever been, you 
put a very good result. I just want to make sure we get our expectations in 
the right place regarding seasonality. And then on the flip side of that, in 
equity trading, I think public volumes are overall light, but my question is, 
wha
t are you seeing on reengagement of PB client balances on margin?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I'll try to take that. On the FID side, you are absolutely correct, first 
quarter has the seasonal strength to it. I would say 
--
 
certainly, four out of 
the last five ye
ars, the first quarter is the strongest quarter of the year. And 
we'll have to see how it plays out. But that's the general historical 
seasonality to that business. We had a nice quarter. As I mentioned in the 
call, a nice rebound from a disappointing four
th quarter and the business. 
We have a lot of confidence in that business and continue to do well. On the 
equity side, we came into the quarter with activity levels low and average 
balances or balances quite low given the volatility in the December 
timefra
me. As I mentioned, we did see PB balances grow steadily throughout 
the quarter. I would say they're still below the levels that we saw sort of in 
the first nine months of 2018. But they have steadily increased and 
continued to increase in this quarter. Bu
t it's interesting that the sentiment 
in that speaks, although the markets have rebounded, I would say that the 
participants are still quite cautious. But balances are clearly rebounding, but 
just not back to the level as we saw in a very prefer 
--
 
very st
rong first nine 
months of last year.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
One quick one, Jon. There's a lot of news flow related to lift and Morgan 
Stanley's potential participation in helping original investors hedge. I know 
you can't talk about a specific issue. What I want to 
ask is what's normal 
course of business? How does that 
--
 
what takes place behind the scenes 
that we don't see? And then if you could comment anything on that 
particular shift, that'd be great.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, but, I mean, we can't, obviously, we can'
t comment on that Glenn. But 
we are in the market making business on behalf of clients. I mean, that's 
what you do in this industry. And, there's no, from our perspective, there's 
absolutely nothing done wrong in dealing with those particular shifts, but 
t
hat's for another day.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of 
Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Sort of fit into capital, I mean, now that you've kind of taken a look at the 
new, the fast scenarios, 
how are you feeling relative to last year with respect 
to the CCAR submission? How should we think about that?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, as you know, we just submitted our plan here at the beginning of the 
month. So we had no particular color or context 
about the results. We'll get 
those at the end of June. I think you saw in January what we said is, and we 
continue to say we have sufficient capital, and we would like to return 100% 
of our earnings going forward. The tests, as you saw, certainly some of t
he 
metrics in the tests, and the macro factors were less severe than they were 
last year. And we started the year with roughly the same balance sheet and 
more capital. So we were in a stronger position. But we'll have to see what 
the results come out in Ja
nuary. But I would continue to say that we believe 
we are capital sufficient and we would like to continue to return our earnings 
to our shareholders.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Okay. So no change for the 100%? And maybe just a follow up on the 
differed comp, can you he
lp us just to understand if there was material P&L 
impact? I would assume there were some offset in comp, but if you could 
just sort of help with that.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. And I would say you sum it up properly, which is the PBT impact both 
in terms of d
ollars and margin is actually quite minimal. You do see some 
variances and revenues in comp where you will see the most differences. 
But overall, from a PBT standpoint, this quarter there was virtually no impact 
to the bottom line. On a margin basis, the v
ast, vast majority of the time, 
the margin will be diluted by movements in PBT because we're generally 
pulling out very low margin dollars from both revenue 
--
 
from the PBT line 
so revenue expense come out at a low margin basis. So it's dilutive to the 
mar
gin. But again, from a bottom line perspective, very limited impact this 
quarter.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe 
Research. Your line is now open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So wanted to starts off with a question on Apr
il tax seasonality and the NII 
outlook. So deposits took a decent lie down in the quarter as clients 

seasonality is expected to be a little bit more pronounced in 2Q following the 
ch
anges in the tax law. And maybe just separately was encouraged to hear 
that the reaffirmation of the loan growth target of mid single
-
digit year
-
over
-

--
 
are you still comfortab
le with the original guidance of NII growth being up 
mid single
-
digit as well?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I will go backwards. Yes on both guidance for loan growth and guidance for 
NII. The loan balances this quarter were down slightly, really being driven by 
paydown
s. We had nice production across the platform. Mortgage as you 
saw was up. We were impacted by the paydowns in both SBL as well as in 
tailored. We've had a very nice start to the second quarter. The first two 
weeks have been very active. Particularly in th
e SBL product, we surmise 
that is the result of the tax season this quarter and whether or not we end 
up in a higher or lower level relative to normal seasonality. But we have 
clearly seen some very strong production and balances in the SBL product 
here in
 
the first two weeks. So again, we feel very good about the mid 
single
-
digit guidance on loan growth and NII, even though, clearly, 
expectations around rates and the forward curve are different than when we 
started the beginning of the year.
 
Steven Chubak
 
And just one follow
-
up for me on some of the fee income drivers in the 
quarter. And having a look at what your peers have reported, clearly the 
firm
-
wide results were quite impressive. I was just wondering if you could 
provide any inside into how much of t
hat fee strength that we saw in 
Investment Management, transactional activity in Wealth and other sales 
and trading is sustainable. And clearly a strong result, I just want to gauge 
how much of that strength is recurring and what we should be comfortable 
r
un rating in our models?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
The three components on the MSIM, again the fee
-
based revenue I 
mentioned, the performance fees and then investments can be lumpy. But 
investment management should be tracking AUM and AUM growth. And we 
-
-
 
as you sa
w what happened in those line items, the second one on other 
sales and trading you mentioned or just other?
 
James Gorman
 
We lost him.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, fees in general, there is 
--
 
we feel very good about the results. There 
wasn't anything particularl
y unique in the results outside of the Investment 
Management comments I made about investments being lumpy and the 
performance fees. We feel very good about the performance. The DCP 
transactional revenues is the one item. As we called out DCP did impact 
tr
ansactional revenues to the positive. Had it not been further? The reversal 
of DCP transactional revenues would continue to be soft. A lot of that was 
the calendar and sort of the defense in posture of our retail clients. So we 
did see the increase in depo
sits coming in the December timeframe. We saw 
that bleed out overtime in the first quarter. And a lot of that went to short
-
term fixed income product, which has a lower commission schedule. So 
again, transactional revenues are soft. And we'll have to see h
ow sentiment 
changes or shifts as the year progresses. But that's one place that I would 
highlight.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of Christian Bolu of Autonomous. Your line 
is open.
 
Christian Bolu
 
So maybe I have a question on expenses and su
stainability. Just trying to 
understand how sustainable the non
-
comp numbers and wealth 
management was? So I think 739 for the quarter, which I believe is the 
lowest since Smith Barney was a quiet, so obviously, very, very strong 
discipline there. What is 
that the new normal? Should we just run rate that 
forward in our models? Or how should we think about the go forward here?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, it was a nice non
-
comp quarter. We do have 
--
 
in terms of the non
-
comp, there is obviously some seasonality re
lated to the expenses and FICO 
and what not. But we've shown extremely good discipline in this business. 
We made significant technology investments over the course of the last year 
or two. We'll continue to balance investment and growth in that area. But a
s 
James mentioned, this is really a scale business and we have the ability to 
really manage that expense base tightly. And you're seeing that. So a year
-
over
-
year, as you mentioned, it's down 3%, and there wasn't anything 
chunky or interesting in that othe
r than real discipline and focus.
 
James Gorman
 
I would just add two things, Christian. One, more narrowly, just, there will 
be some integration costs for the Solium. I think the deal is closing in May. 
Am I right Jon?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure.
 
James 
Gorman
 
There'll be some integration costs with that, some technology investments 
and so on. Again, I'm not, that's obviously huge given just the size of the 
business, but that may make down some numbers around a little bit over 
the next couple of quarters.
 
I don't know exactly, but my guess is a little bit. 
But more broadly, we came out of last summer and set as the management 
committee. I think, in September, and just came to a view that the revenue 
outlook for 2019 did not appear at that point that it was
 
likely to exceed 
2018. I think we had an incredible start in '18. We had the two best quarters 
in our history. And the third quarter was very close to that. We've never 
broken $10 billion revenue, and we had two in a row and then $9.8 million. 
And we were
 
right frankly. The fourth quarter turned out to be a 
disappointing from a revenue perspective. We could see the decline coming. 
We didn't know how that turnaround would happen. That shutdown 
appeared imminent and then actually happened. The trade wars wer
e 
hardening up. It was taking down sentiments. So there was a lot of 
negativity building through the end of the year. And around September, 
October, we started taking a hard look at expenses, because you can't 
change the expenses once you're in the middle 
of the quarter. It just 
--
 
it 
doesn't work. I mean, there's very little pure discretionary stuff you can just 
stop. You can stop people traveling around 
--
 
going to client stuffs and 
some, that'll save you a few million bucks. But if you are going to make 
a 
real move, you've got to be quite strategic about it. And the teams that are 
focusing on this September, October, November, even some of that didn't 
come through till 
--
 
where it had started the quarter. It didn't start day one. 
But there's a whole machi
ne around expense management here, which 
we've had for a few years that's started with project streamline. And we kind 
of re
-
upped that machine again, turned the engines back on and got them 
going, and they did a great job. So my view is we keep this disci
pline. I'm 
not 
--
 
the world remains uncertain. I'd love to think the next three quarters 
are better than the last three quarters of last year. But I'm a betting man, 
I'm not sure I make that bet right now. The world is uncertain. And until we 
see more clar
ity, we're going to be very disciplined. There's not a panic. We 
--
 
it's just good smart expense management. 3% decline is not a massive 
move, but as you saw on the margins on some of these businesses, that 
really helped. So that's the general philosophy u
ntil we get greater visibility 
and confidence of the outlook is at up outlook year
-
over
-
year. We're going 
to manage entirely.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Maybe just switching a bit here, back to I guess, Solium. On more broadly, 
just broader wealth management of digita
l wealth management strategy, is 
there any thought here of building a sort of Merrill Edge
-
style platform to 
better serve, as you said, the younger demographic and maybe customers 
more, more digitally which is one part of the question. And maybe the 
second
 
part of the Solium question is, are there any revenue dis
-
synergies 
we should be aware of? I know that I believe some of your competitors are 
served by Solium. So I'm not sure if those deals carry over when you close 
the deal in May?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
A cou
ple of things, and I'll take a first crack at this. As you know, we've 
been significantly investing in the digital platforms, both from a client 
perspective, but also an FA and an operating and an efficiency perspective. 
And one of the real exciting things
 
about the Solium deal is our ability to use 
those digital investments more broadly with this younger demographic and 
this sort of emerging investor, demographic, as people build wealth in the 
workplace. So we spent significant resources building out, our 
virtual advisor 
as well as our access investing, which is a robo platform. So we'll be able to 
provide digital advice and digital applications to these younger, less affluent 
customers as they build wealth and then hopefully channel them into the 
broader F
A traditional model that we have. So that's one of the exciting 
elements of it. And then, in terms of the second part of your question on just 
to costs or the programs, this is a very exciting space. Employers are looking 
for full service solutions for the
ir employees, the combination of Solium and 
their sort of state
-
of
-
the
-
art technology combined with our platform, both on 
the digital side and the full service, and our ability to deal with things like 
401(k) pension benefits, as well as our goals
-
based pl
anning, our digital 
platform, and then lastly, financial education and wellness. This is a real 
interesting, comprehensive product offering for employers. And we would 
expect the growth to accelerate as we combine these platforms over the 
next couple, as I
 
said, 12 to 18 months.
 
James Gorman
 
I'd just add from a strategic perspective, I mean, it's always fun to talk 
about new stuff. And a lot of the media attention and sometimes investor 
attention gets very focused on what's new and sexy and different. And 
S
olium kind of checks all of those boxes. But it's small. I mean, let's be 
realistic here. I mean, it's a 
--
 
I think it's a very interesting strategic play 
that will play out over a number of years and puts us squarely in the space 
we want to be in, but at 
a small. We have a $17 billion revenue business in 
Wealth Management that has nothing to do with Solium right now. That is 
the main game, driving the margins in that business, shifting the assets on 
to new types of platforms, building out the banks and len
ding products. They 
are the massive moves that are going to take place over the next several 
years. I think the wealth management for our Asia platform is very 
important as that continues to grow. So I just 
--
 
I don't want to dampen the 
enthusiasm. I just 
want to put in context that to win in workplace and losing 
the advisory would not be a good answer. Our job is to win in the advisory, 
crush that and add these other verticals as opportunities permit and 
opportunity opened and we took it.
 
Operator
 
Our next
 
question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your 
line is open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Since the last quarter you guys talked quite a bit about M&A opportunities. 
And Solium was announced soon after that, and maybe some foreshadowing 
there. I'm just 
curious if you're still actively looking for opportunistic M&A 
here whether it would be DWM or asset management? And last quarter, 
you'd also mentioned potentially pursuing some new client segments. I'm 
just trying to think about what some of those segment
s could be? Are there 
any specific areas that are maybe more attractive today?
 
James Gorman
 
We have a very high bar on M&A. It's how they got to bring scale to an 
existing business. It's got to be an area of where we have clay competencies 
or it's got to b
e something which fills out is complementary to our platform 
might and give us scale, but fills out and broadens our platform. I think 
where you saw, it Mesa West is a good example of that. What you saw with 
Solium is a good example of that. What you saw a
t Smith Barney was a 
good example of pure scale play. So yes, we're looking opportunities, but 
we're very, I don't know if conservative is the word, but we're definitely not 
compulsively trying to buy stuff. That's not where I hit is that. On the other 
han
d, as we see things that we think is smart and can fit on the platform 
and culturally good fit, we'll go for it. Jon do you want to add to that?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No. I think your focus is right in terms of both Wealth and IM. Sort of more 
of the fee
-
based t
ype businesses, less balance sheet intensive, and that's 
really what the focus has been. And that's what the two deals we saw over 
the last few years were.
 
Devin Ryan
 
So just a follow
-
up here on Wealth Management. I know there are a number 
of growth initia
tives there today and a number that are kind of beyond 
adding financial advisors. But you've actually had a slight increase in advisor 
headcount over the past three quarters. I know it's small. But can you 
maybe talk about the backdrop for financial adviso
r recruiting, if there's 
been any change in kind of appetite there or maybe attractiveness of 
recruiting, especially, with some of the expense rolling off from the Smith 
Barney retention and other employee loans amortizing?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I mean, I 
think, first and foremost, I would just say one of this has 
been less movement of people both in and out and that's good for stability of 
the platform, the ability to build relationships and continue to invest, so 
that's a positive. You did mention, I thin
k, recruiting, last year was quite 
slow for us as we focused on digital and adoption and things of that nature. I 
think we have a very attractive platform. So we're seeing interest in joining 
our platforms. So there could be some marginal pickup in that ar
ea. But 
that's not really going to be a growth engine for us. And I would say one 
thing that I call that in the script is, the numbers will go up and down in 
terms of headcount. I think productivity is critically important. And you've 
seen us to increase t
he productivity of the average advisor, quite 
consistently over the timeframe. So we're happy with that. But just less 
movement of people, broadly speaking is better. James mentioned, we saw 
the roll
-
off of the retention notes. We did actually see an uptic
k. But again, 
these are not big numbers in uptick and retirements. But they were sort of 
well planned for. As you know, most advisors now work in teams, and we've 
gotten a very good program in place to help them transition their book of 
business to a young
er member of their team and continue to retain those 
assets, even though people are leaving the business or retiring. So we feel 
very good about the stability of where we are right now.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lim o
f Societe 
Generale. Your line is open.
 
Andrew Lim
 
So I just had a follow on from the question asked earlier, perhaps if you give 
some color on the other revenues within the Institutional Securities, you've 
referenced smart market gains associated with corp
orate lending activity. 
It's just due to spread tightening. How feasible is it to expect more that's 
going forward? Or is it just a reversal of some spread lining that we still in 
the 4Q? And then the second question is on CLOs and average lending. It's a 
question that asked one of your competitors. But I was wondering if you've 
seen any changes in Japanese buyers for CLOs, U.S. CLOs, especially the 
highly rated stuff regarding changes to Japanese regulations, a few weeks 
ago, which have required CLO issuer
s to have 5% risk attention?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. And again, I think the 
--
 
I'll try and take those questions separately. 
The other revenues, there's a lot of things that are moving around. And 
those three lines, other revenues, other sales and trading, i
nvestments, I 
think you have to look at the broadly in context and then we try to call out 
what we think the biggest drivers of the changes are. And other sales and 
trading, this quarter, you see some of the impact of the deferred comps that 
we talked abou
t. We also saw that's where we have a lot of our hedging 
activity, and obviously, spreads tighten, so there were losses there on the 
flip side and the other revenue line. We have the mark
-
to
-
market on those 
same positions. And so those just generally had b
een offsetting each other. 
So again, there's a lot of moving parts in those businesses, and we've tried 
to 
--
 
excuse me, in those line items. And we've tried to call out the main 
differences. On the CLOs, as you mentioned, the risk retention rules are 
new.
 
We haven't seen a big change in behavior issuance in the first quarter. 
It was down slightly in terms of CLOs versus where they were last quarter 
last year, but it was certainly healthy. Our expectation is given the pricing 
dynamic more than the risk rete
ntion rules. We're given the pricing dynamic. 
We'd expect CLO issuance to decline year
-
over
-
year, but it's been pretty 
healthy in the first quarter, and it's supporting a pretty healthy leverage loan 
market.

Thank you. Our next question comes 
from the line of Matt O'Connor of 
Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Good trends in the compensation down 5% year
-
over
-
year. I guess I would 
have thought there might have been even more flexibility just given some of 
the roll
-
off of the retent
ion and then also some of the pull
-
forward that you 
did in 4Q. Obviously, we're just looking at one quarter here, and you're 
optimistic on the revenue outlook. But just talk about some of those 
dynamics and the flexibility you have, specifically in comp, a
nd layer the 
retention and the roll
-
off 
--
 
sorry, and the front ending of some 
compensation in 4Q?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'll try to take that in the two components. On the ISG side, you saw the 
comp ratios sort of consistent with last year's first quarter. Reve
nues were 
down, so obviously comp was impacted by that. And we continue to believe 
or continue to manage that tightly. We want to be competitive in 
compensation and retain and attract the best people and we think we have 
the flexibility to do that within t
he context of the of the comp ratio in that 
business. On the Wealth side, if you look at year
-
over
-
year, there was very 
little change in the comp ratio. You're right, the retention did roll off. And as 
I mentioned also, the DCP or the deferred comp plan is
 
just the movement 
that we've called out in the transactional revenues. While it's dilutive to the 
PBT margin, it's actually accretive to the comp. Its revenue margin, because 
we're pulling out high comp revenue dollars to the revenues when we 
backed that 
out. So the comp ratio would have been actually down, had it 
not been down, had it not been for the movements in the DCP. We did roll 
off those notes in the first quarter. But if again, comparing year
-
over
-
year, 
we've been investing in the business, and in
 
terms of both people and comp 
levels. But again, if you were to backup the DCP, you'd see a more start 
decline.

Our next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos of HSBC. Your line is 
open.
 
Alevizos Alevizakos
 
It's a strategic question regar
ding your technology investment, especially 
given that you've already locked into acquisitions like Solium Capital. I 
remember that you previously disclosed the $4 billion budget for technology. 
And I was wondering how do you think about it for 2018 given 
that the 
revenue backdrop is slightly lower. At the same time, you've already done 
an acquisition for close of $1 billion. So will that remain the same go higher, 
go lower? And how much did you spend for changing the bank? Thank you.
 
James Gorman
 
I'm not s
ure I want to get into great detail about the technology budget. I 
wouldn't expect it to change materially year
-
over
-
year, probably the mix is 
changing a little bit. We're moving into some of the more innovative areas of 
technology, and we've made a major 
push with our cyber defense. We have 
--
 
doing a lot of work around machine learning at the moment, Big data 
management, so all the stuff that you would expect us to be doing. We're 
doing. I think we spent a lot of money getting regulatory compliance in the
 
last five, eight years from a technology perspective. And once you're 
complained, you're complained, you don't have to keep spending that. So 
and we made a lot of changes to the Wealth Management platform, the user 
interface from the various tools the adv
isors have at their workplace. And 
once you've done that, you don't have to keep doing it at the same pace. So 
I think, if I was sitting in front of one of your models, I would probably be 
modeling more or less flat. And within that there's a change in mix
 
going on. 
We're 
--
 
it's easy just to throw back at some money at technology. It's 
something 
--
 
because people are talking about it so much. It's very 
fashionable to do that. And we're also running a business. So I think we 
want to find the right balance.
 
Alevizos Alevizakos
 
And as a follow
-
up on something you said just before, you mentioned that 
you would only be considering to do acquisitions or investments that they 
would actually add scale to your business. And clearly, Investment 
Management, I think is
 
one of the places where you are subscale compared 
to some of your competitors. And there was a rumor on Bloomberg, last 
month that you may be looking for a large German wealth asset manager? 
Would that make any sense from a strategic perspective? Thank yo
u.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, one, I don't comment on rumors. Two, I didn't even see the article. 
Three, I think the probability of us investing in a European wealth 
management given that we sold our European wealth management business 
a few years ago is somewhere
 
between zero and none. But apart from that, 

as clearly to me, the easiest acquisition is where you building sale 
economics. But we look at products and capabilities fill in. That'
s just as 
important as if we're going to grow, we can't just rely upon getting deep 
from what we're doing. We've also got to expand the range of things we're 
doing. I think that's exactly. Jon may have a comment on this. That's exactly 
what we did in the a
sset management space. I think what Dan Simkowitz 
and his team is focused on Jon.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. And again, I would look at the asset management space. It's not 
necessarily in totality. If you look at the different products that were in, the 
equity p
roducts, the fixed income products, the alternative products, there 
are certain businesses that we feel that we're very effective and are at scale. 
And we'd like to continue to add little product or product capabilities, Mesa 
West in the Equity product in 
terms of commercial real estate, excuse me, 
the debt products in commercial real estate was one area that we like to fill 
in. I would say, in fixed income, we would probably like to see more scale in 
that business. We continue to make key hires and invest 
for public and 
private credit, and will continue to do that. We try to build out that business. 
But I would tell you the other businesses within asset management when we 
do that scale.

1/19/18,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During 
today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release, strategic update 
and financial supplement, copies of which are available at 
morganstanley.com.
 
Today's 
presentation may include forward
-
looking statements that are 
subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ 
materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward
-
looking statements 
and non
-
GAAP measures that appear in the ea
rnings release. This 
presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.
 
Page 3 of the strategic update shows our reported results and our results 
adjusted to exclude the aggregate impact of net discrete tax provision in the 
fourth quarte
r that resulted from the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act 
and other intermittent net discrete tax benefits unrelated to the Tax Act. 
These adjusted operating performance metrics will be utilized throughout the 
remainder of this presentation in order t
o assess our strategic objective 
established in 2016.
 
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning, everybody. Thank you, Sharon. Thank you, everyone, for 
joining us. I'm going to take 
you through a summary of last year's 
performance as well as our outlook and plan for 2018. Following my 
remarks, Jon will take you through the quarter in detail. And after that, we 
will both take your questions. If we could start by turning to Slide 4 in t
he 
deck. At this point in our strategic evolution, it's worth putting our future 
goals in the context of what has taken place over the last several years. As 
illustrated in this slide, our primary focus in the early years was to put the 
troubles of the fin
ancial crisis behind us and to complete the full integration 
of the Wealth Management business. These steps were critical in order to 
reposition our firm to benefit from our world
-
class and complementary 
franchises. Then in early 2016, we outlined a 2
-
year
 
strategic plan. The 
plan's primary goal was to achieve a 9% to 11% return on equity by the end 
of 2017. It also included a number of quantifiable secondary targets that we 
aim to achieve over the same time frame. Looking forward, with these 
targets achiev
ed and a solid strategy in place, our management team will 
continue to work towards generating sustained high returns by investing for 
growth while maintaining fiscal vigilance and capital sufficiency.
 
Slide 5. It outlines the key strategic objectives we a
im to achieve by 2017. 
In each instance, our 2017 results are in line with or better than the target 
ranges.
 
On Slide 6, we provide a more in
-
depth perspective, focusing on the financial 
backdrop that influence these results. As you all know, 2017 was a mi
xed 
year. While many financial markets produced strong returns and U.S. 
monetary policy continued to tighten gradually, benign markets impacted 
trading conditions. As we're all aware, much of 2017 was characterized by 
persistently low volatility across bot
h rates and equities. This dearth of 
activity impacted our more market
-
dependent businesses. Despite these 
trading conditions, we were able to gain wallet share and capitalize on 
pockets of opportunity as they presented themselves.
 
Our strategic plan for t
he past 2 years has focused on two equally important 
goals, increasing profitability and demonstrating stability of earnings. On 
Slide 7, we show the increase in profitability since 2015 both across earnings 
per share and ROE as well as return on tangible 
common equity. As many of 
you have requested, this is a metric we will highlight going forward.
 
Turning to the next slide. We illustrate how our business mix has aided the 
improvement of earnings stability. Of course, this stability is the direct result 
of
 
many changes, all aimed at building complementary franchises in 
securities, Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment 
Management. Importantly, a greater proportion of our earnings are now 
derived from more stable and higher
-
ROE businesses
. This increased 
contribution from Wealth Management and Investment Management should 
help preserve profitability during periods of market disruption.
 
Slide 9 shows as we look forward and outline areas for organic growth and 
further operational improvement
. At the forefront of this plan is our strategy 
of deepening our lending footprint across our Wealth Management and 
Institutional Securities franchises. That will further add to the objectives of 
stability and consistency that I discussed earlier. We also 
see opportunities 
from continuing to press our advantage in our traditional areas of strength. 
Additionally, we will look for ways to realize the potential of our Investment 
Management platform, leveraging our attractive business mix, global client 
footpri
nt and top
-
tier performing strategies. Our intention is to achieve these 
objectives while remaining fiscally vigilant and driving efficiency gains. When 
this disciplined execution is combined with attractive return profile, we feel 
confident we can deliver
 
ongoing attractive returns.
 
Slide 10 illustrates the steady growth of our lending footprint as well as the 
diversity of the overall lending mix. We continue to see demand for financing 
solutions and opportunities to deploy capital at attractive returns to
 
support 
our clients' needs. This lending growth is supported by a high
-
quality deposit 
base, which is sourced predominantly from our existing Wealth Management 
client footprint. We look forward to discussing our lending and deposit 
strategies in greater d
etail during the year ahead.
 
Turning now to Slide 11. Since the full acquisition of Smith Barney in 2013, 
we've focused on opportunities that come from being a premier wealth 
management provider at scale. We've witnessed material growth in our two 
main sou
rces of annuitized revenues, fee
-
based assets and client liabilities, 
which produces, of course, net interest income. In both cases, we've made 
significant investments, enhancing our advisory platforms and banking and 
lending infrastructure, respectively. 
This has enabled us to take advantage 
of secular industry trends. At the same time, we continue to optimize our 
expense base while still investing in future growth initiatives, including our 
digital offering. Despite investments, noncompensation expenses a
re 
actually down from 5 years ago. The margin expansion demonstrates the 
business' undeniable scale benefits.
 
Slide 12 shows the resulting impact to our revenue profile. Material revenue 
growth has been complemented by a change in revenue mix. Transactiona
l 
activity, historically a more volatile source of revenues, has been 
significantly reduced and offset by growth in net interest income and fee
-
based revenue. As a result, average daily revenues have increased. 
Importantly, looking to the right of this sli
de, in 2017, 88% of days were 
above $60 million a day compared to 42% of that number in 2015.
 
Slide 13 summarizes the future growth and margin opportunities in Wealth 
Management. Two years ago, we provided a 23% to 25% pretax margin 
target. This target was
 
premised on an expectation that we would be able to 
grow both net interest and noninterest revenues while maintaining expense 
discipline. The objective was achieved, and it resulted in a full year 2017 
margin of 25.5%. We continue to see upside to this ma
rgin. Over the next 2 
years, we expect to achieve a 26% to 28% margin. Achieving this revised 
target will be dependent on executing on a number of revenue and expense 
initiatives that are outlined on the right
-
hand side of the page. Recall that 
we expect t
he margin to be positively impacted in excess of 100 basis points 
as the Smith Barney retention notes will be fully amortized by January of 
2019, also at the same time we will continue to invest for growth.
 
Turn to slide 14, which provides an overview of t
he progress made in 
Institutional Securities. The bar chart on the side shows the aggregate wallet 
of Morgan Stanley and our top 8 peers for each business, with the green 
circle illustrating our share of that wallet. As you can see, over the past 5 
years, 
we have gained wallet share in each business line. As it relates to 
2017, we witnessed solid results across all businesses. Investment Banking, 
it had its best year post crisis, driven by strong performance in all 
businesses, including our ECM franchise, w
hich ranked #1 globally in a 
resurgent underwriting market. In Equity Sales & Trading, we maintained 
our #1 position for the fourth consecutive year, with a wallet share in excess 
of 20%, allowing us to maintain revenues of approximately $8 billion despite
 
a smaller wallet. In Fixed Income Sales & Trading, we've gained share while 
resizing our business to one which is both critically and credibly sized and 
more appropriate for the wallet opportunity, and it generated more revenues 
than prior to the restruct
uring.
 
Slide 15 outlines the progress we've seen in Fixed Income Sales & Trading 
franchise since the meaningful restructuring we undertook in 2015. Our 
target was to maintain our historical revenue footprint, but with reduced 
resources. As previously discu
ssed, we met this goal in both 2016 and 2017, 
2 years that saw very different market backdrops. These results are 
encouraging, particularly as we're able to navigate a more difficult 2017 and 
gain share despite a diminished industry wallet. Going forward, 
we aim to 
maintain a stable footprint in what we expect to be an improved industry 
wallet.
 
Slide 16 outlines our Investment Management business. As I've noted 
before, Investment Management represents a high
-
returning business with 
opportunities for future 
growth. The approximate $482 billion of assets 
under management represents an attractive and complementary mix of 
alternative and traditional platforms. As illustrated, a meaningful portion of 
our revenues come from businesses such as alternatives, high
-
co
nviction 
equities and emerging markets. These are businesses where we believe we 
can deliver differentiated client value. As we've successfully undergone an 
organizational realignment and legacy cleanups over the past 2 years, we're 
now positioning the bus
iness for growth. 3 key drivers of growth will be 
investment performance, client partnerships and distribution and product 
innovations.
 
Slide 17 provides examples of our ability to deliver on this growth potential. 
Our global distribution capabilities are 
notable. Approximately 2/3 of our 
2017 gross sales have come from outside the U.S. Strong positive net flows 
from these markets represent a differentiated contributor to assets under 
management growth. The examples outlined at the bottom of this slide 
illu
strate that funds with differentiated strategies and strong investment 
performance tend to deliver significant AUM growth. We have identified a 
broad set of actionable organic growth opportunities within Investment 
Management. Moreover, as mentioned on our
 
last call, we will continue to 
opportunistically evaluate M&A opportunities, such as Mesa West, where we 
can fill gaps or accelerate growth.
 
Turning now to Slide 18. As a management team, we're focused on fiscal 
discipline. Optimizing our expense base has
 
been a key driver of this 
approach as demonstrated by the multiple efficiency ratio targets we have 
set for ourselves over the years. For 2017, the success of our Project 
Streamline cost
-
savings initiative generated an efficiency ratio of 72.6%, a 
signifi
cant improvement relative to 2015, and indeed, inside our target of 
74%. In 2018, we will adopt new accounting standards that Jon will touch 
on. While this change is PBT
-
neutral, there will be negative impact on the 
overall firm efficiency ratio. Looking t
hrough that lens, the efficiency ratio 
would have been approximately 73% in 2017, slightly up. Going forward, 
our goal is to continue to drive efficiencies across the businesses and 
maintain a ratio below the 73% level.
 
Slide 19 outlines our historical cap
ital return. In recent years, we've 
consistently increased our dividend and significantly grown our total payout 
to over $5 billion in 2017. Our non
-
objection from the 2017 CCAR 
submission allows us to return almost $7 billion in dividends and buybacks 
thr
ough 2Q 2018. The increase in capital return has been executed while 
we've concurrently invested for future growth and maintained adequate 
capital levels. Strong capital return is a critical element of our future 
success, and we believe we are more than su
fficiently capitalized for our 
business mix, size and risk profile. We remain optimistic about regulatory 
refinements in the area of capital. However, it's too early to predict the 
magnitude of any changes, but we expect some relief while still maintaining
 
extremely prudent capital and liquidity levels.
 
Finally, let me touch on the impact of the U.S. corporate tax reform on Slide 
20. Whereas the impact to the overall economic backdrop and activity levels 
within our business segments will only become clearer
 
over time, we expect 
an immediate positive impact to our financial results in 2018. As a result of 
our significant U.S. earnings contribution, not least here, our Wealth 
Management segment, we expect to see a meaningful reduction in our 
effective corporat
e tax rate. These estimates are based on our current 
interpretation of the legislative changes. They may change as we receive 
additional guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over 
time.
 
So Slide 21 summarizes our key strategic objective
s over the course of the 
next two years, and they include, delivering a Wealth Management pretax 
margin of 26% to 28%; expanding our ISG penetration and leadership 
across the businesses; positioning Investment Management for growth; and 
finally, realizing 
a firm efficiency ratio of 73% or better. Together with an 
attractive capital return profile, the fulfillment of these targets will enable us 
to continue to drive ROE growth higher. Predicting ROE, of course, is 
difficult. That said, given our growth initi
atives, maintaining expense 
discipline and recent changes to U.S. corporate tax law, we are increasing 
our target ROE range to 10% to 13% from 9% to 11% over the medium 
term. This new range underscores our belief that annually we should be able 
to consiste
ntly exceed our cost of capital across a variety of market 
backdrops. This management team is committed to executing on our 
strategy while looking for compelling growth opportunities in order to bring 
these objectives to fruition, which will provide both f
uture profitability and 
performance.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Jon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and 
annual results in more detail. Then together, we'd be delighted to take your 
questions. Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you, and good morning.
 
In many respects, the fourth quarter's 
operating environment represented a continuation of the third quarter. In 
Sales & Trading, volatility across equity and fixed income markets remained 
depressed. Consequently, client activity was limited, affecting Fi
xed Income 
in particular. Corporate clients, however, remained active, driving strong 
results in Investment Banking. Investment Management momentum 
continued. And notably, Wealth Management posted new records. Firm 
revenues were $9.5 billion. In the quarte
r, PBT was $2.5 billion, EPS was 
$0.29 and ROE was 2.9%. Excluding aggregate discrete tax items of $1 
billion, adjusted EPS was $0.84, and adjusted ROE was 8.6%.
 
For the fourth quarter, total noninterest expense was $7 billion, a 5% 
sequential increase, dr
iven by higher compensation expense on higher 
revenues and seasonally higher marketing and business development and 
other expenses. Our full year efficiency ratio of 72.6% is below our 74% 
target we set 2 years ago. This marks the successful completion of 
Project 
Streamline, our initiative to reduce expenses by $1 billion relative to the 
2015 levels. The target assumed flat revenues and incorporated a reduction 
across both compensation and noncompensation expenses. Project 
Streamline was broad
-
based, with o
ver 200 separate initiatives across the 
entire firm. Some notable successes include, improving our workforce 
strategy by converting consultants and contingent workers into more cost
-
efficient FTEs and leveraging our U.S. and international centers of 
excell
ence; reducing professional services expenses by improved 
procurement processes and the implementation of technology
-
enabled 
solutions to reduce redundancies and reducing our technology
-
related 
expenses by consolidating 12 legacy data centers into 5. The a
doption of 
private cloud and virtualization technology was an important component of 
the compression enabling us to achieve a smaller technology footprint. We 
have remained disciplined around compensation, achieving compensation 
ratios for Institutional Se
curities and Wealth Management below our targets 
of 37% and 56%, respectively. We have also seen a reduction in litigation 
expenses. The 460 basis point increase in our pretax margin achieved over 
the 2
-
year period provides the best illustration of the suc
cess of the project. 
Relative to 2015, ex DVA, full year 2017 revenue is up $3.4 billion or 10%, 
while noncompensation expenses are down 3%. This generated an increase 
in pretax profits of $2.5 billion or 32%. Looking ahead, our focus will be on 
ensuring t
hat the savings achieved remain permanently out of the expense 
base. This will be key for us to maintain a firm efficiency ratio of 73% or 
below.
 
Now to the businesses. Net revenues in our Institutional Securities business 
of $4.5 billion represents a 3% s
equential increase. The slowdown in Fixed 
Income was offset by strength in Investment Banking. On a full year basis, 
net revenues of $18.8 billion were up 8%, representing our sixth consecutive 
year of growth ex DVA and a new postcrisis high. Noncompensati
on 
expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, driven by seasonally higher 
business development and other expenses. Compensation expenses were 
$1.6 billion, bringing our full year compensation to net revenue ratio to 
35%, an approximate 200 basis point red
uction compared to 2015.
 
Investment Banking continued to show strength. Revenues of $1.4 billion 
were up 13% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. The increase was driven by 
underwriting, particularly in equity, which increased 52%. This was partially 
offset by a 6% 
reduction in advisory revenues. Looking at the full year, 
Investment Banking results benefited from the broad
-
based rebound in 
underwriting activity. Equity and Fixed Income underwriting were up 67% 
and 44%, respectively. Revenue growth across all regions 
and virtually all 
products contributed to these results. We continue to leverage our global 
footprint, working with clients to deliver holistic solutions. From a regional 
perspective, Asia showed a meaningful sequential increase, particularly in 
equity und
erwriting, demonstrating the value of our global franchise. We 
continue to expect Asian markets to play a key role in 2018. For the year, 
we were #1 globally in IPOs, equity and equity
-
linked offerings and #2 in 
announced and completed M&A. Full year reven
ues of $5.5 billion represent 
the second
-
highest in our history. Overall, our Investment Banking pipelines 
remain healthy and diversified across products, regions and sectors. 
Underwriting markets globally remain very receptive to a wide range of 
issuers w
ith a variety of financing needs as credit spreads remain low, 
volatility muted and market liquidity deep. CEO confidence remains high, 
and we are actively engaged with our clients. Results, however, may be 
impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and geopoli
tical events. Despite 
these uncertainties, we believe that the diversity of our franchise across 
both products and geographies will position us well for the year to come.
 
In Sales & Trading, revenues were down 8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Muted 
markets charact
erized by continued low volatility and lack of idiosyncratic 
market
-
moving events impacted results. In equities, we retained our 
leadership position and are 1# globally for the fourth consecutive year. Our 
full year revenues were approximately $8 billion d
espite much of the year 
being impacted by historically low equity volatility. Year
-
over
-
year, we saw a 
growth in EMEA and Asia, offsetting a modest decline in the Americas. From 
a product perspective, derivative revenues were down on fewer large 
structured
 
transactions in 2017, which was partially offset by higher cash 
revenues.
 
Looking ahead to 2018, the implementation of MiFID II continues to be a 
focus area for many investors. We continue to see strong client demand for 
content, liquidity and financing s
olutions. Based on these early weeks, we 
have navigated MiFID as expected and have provided support to our clients 
through this complex process.
 
Fixed Income revenues in the fourth quarter were $808 million, down 31% 
versus last quarter. The sequential dec
line was primarily driven by our 
macro businesses, which saw low client activity. Low volatility weighed on 
our rates and FX businesses. Credit results exhibited stability against a 
favorable backdrop for risk assets, and our lending businesses continued t
o 
be a source of stable revenues. In 2015, we made the decision to resize and 
reshape the business because we believed the size of the wallet would not 
change materially for the next several years. Since taking action, the wallet 
has been in a plus or minu
s $5 billion range from the $63 billion we saw in 
2015. In 2017, we generated revenues of $4.9 billion despite a multiyear 
low for the industry wallet. Importantly, we believe there's operational 
leverage in the business should the wallet recover.
 
Now movi
ng to Wealth Management, which posted record quarterly revenues 
and PBT. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.4 billion, a 4% sequential 
increase contributing to a full year revenue growth of 10%. The PBT margin 
was 26.1% for the quarter and 25.5% for the full 
year, a year
-
over
-
year 
increase of more than 300 basis points. We continue to see the benefits of 
scale. Total annual expenses grew by only 5%, generating full year pretax 
profit growth of 25%. The expense leverage has enabled us to maintain a 
substantial 
level of investments into our future capabilities, including our 
digital, banking and advisory platforms, while at the same time increasing 
our margins. Total assets grew by 3% to $2.4 trillion in the fourth quarter. 
Total fee
-
based assets grew by 4%, now 
comprising 44% of total client 
assets. And fee
-
based asset flows of $21 billion capped a record year with 
total flows of $75 billion. Higher asset levels, combined with strong flows, 
contributed to asset management revenues of $2.5 billion, representing 3%
 
growth relative to the third quarter. Net interest income of $1.1 billion is up 
5% sequentially. The benefit from higher asset yields and lending balances 
was partially offset by higher funding costs as we diversify our deposit 
products. Full year NII gro
wth of $576 million or 16% was driven by an 
increase in average loan balances of approximately $10 billion and higher 
rates. In 2018, we would expect NII growth to slow based on our anticipated 
funding mix and higher deposit betas than we experienced in 20
17.
 
Transactional revenues of $790 million increased 7% sequentially. On a full 
year basis, transactional revenues were stable, following a multiyear decline. 
Total noninterest expenses increased 5% sequentially, driven by higher 
comp on greater revenues a
nd seasonally higher market and business 
development expenses. The full year compensation to net revenue ratio was 
55.6%, in line with our target. This quarter's performance again 
demonstrates the strength and stability of our Wealth Management 
franchise. 
Investment Management witnessed another solid quarter with 
stable asset management fees and broad
-
based investment gains. Total net 
revenues were $637 million, down 6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. The quarter 
included an impairment of an investment in a third
-
par
ty manager reflected 
in other revenue. Full year revenues were $2.6 billion, a 22% increase 
versus the prior year. Our AUM of $482 billion in the fourth quarter grew 8% 
with positive net flows across all strategies, including strong seasonal flows 
in our l
iquidity business. As James discussed, we continue to see increased 
investor interest for strategies where we deliver differentiated value and 
strong investment performance. Net flows across our active strategies as 
well as private fund capital raising rea
ched multiyear highs in 2017. Asset 
management fees of $572 million were up 1% sequentially. On a full year 
basis, asset management fees increased 6%, in line with the growth in our 
average AUM. Investment revenues were $112 million, down 2% relative to 
th
e last quarter. Full year investment revenues were $449 million, up 
considerably from last year, which included sales and markdowns on legacy 
LP investments and third
-
party
-
sponsored funds. As discussed in the past, 
this line item has potential to be lumpy
.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. On a sequential basis, total spot assets of 
$852 billion were essentially unchanged. Our pro forma fully phased
-
in 
standardized RWAs are also expected to remain stable at $379 billion. In 
addition, our pro forma fully phased
-
in Basel III standardized Common 
Equity Tier 1 ratio is expected to decrease to 16%, and our pro forma fully 
phased
-
in supplementary leverage ratio is expected to decrease to 6.4%. 
The decline in both ratios is driven by the net discrete tax provision rec
orded 
in the quarter.
 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.25 billion of 
common stock or approximately 25 million shares, and our board declared a 
$0.25 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 71.5%. And 
for the ful
l year, it was 39.7%. These rates include the approximate $1.2 
billion net discrete tax provision due to the enactment of Corporate Tax 
Reform in the fourth quarter, primarily relating to the remeasurement of 
certain net deferred tax assets using the lower
 
enacted tax rate. This was 
partially offset by other intermittent net discrete tax benefits unrelated to 
tax reform, which totaled $168 million in the fourth quarter and $233 million 
for the full year. Excluding these items, the adjusted tax rates were 31
.4% 
for the fourth quarter and 30.8% for the full year. In 2018, we expect our 
tax rate to be reduced to 22% to 25% for the full year while exhibiting 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter volatility. Our first quarter tax rate is expected to be 
lower as the vast majority of
 
conversions of employee share
-
based awards 
into firm shares will occur in this quarter. 2017 was a year of mixed 
environments for our businesses. As we look ahead to 2018, we are 
cautiously optimistic that the trading backdrop we saw in the fourth quarter
 
will not persist. Further, there are a number of possible macro drivers that 
can positively impact the year ahead. Tax reform, in addition to the direct 
impact to our earnings, should provide the impetus for further engagement 
across corporate, institutio
nal and retail clients. Continued monetary policy 
normalization will benefit our bank franchise and has the potential to lead to 
greater activity across Sales & Trading. We remain optimistic that regulatory 
refinement will reduce complexity and the adminis
trative burden.
 
With that, we will now open the line to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn 
Schorr with Evercore ISI.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
So I absolutely like the higher ROE 
targets. I'm curious if you could outline 
even just the highest level thoughts of assumptions behind them for both 
markets and rates. And then maybe more importantly, how much do you 
consider, like that of 
--
 
that, that is numerator growth, meaning returns
? 
And how much does denominator shrink in terms of cap returns? Because 
you obviously have really high capital ratios.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think maybe I'll take the second half of the question first and then maybe 
James will add. In terms of numerator and de
nominator, as we said in the 
past, we think we're capital sufficient, and we'd like to continue to increase 
our capital return over the 2
-
year period that we talked about that. Our 
capital has actually grown by about $2 billion but, on average, our balance
 
sheet has grown about $40 billion. So again, we believe that we're capital 
sufficient. And so therefore, the growth in ROE should be driven by the 
numerator and not the denominator. And in terms of the general capital 
return, as James mentioned, we haven'
t gotten the instructions for 2018. So 
I think it's a little early to predict how all of this sort of works into CCAR. In 
terms of operating environment, for the assumptions, we generally budget 
based on sort of a continuation of what we've seen in 2017 an
d also the 
forward curve. So generally, a positive macro backdrop and continuation of 
global growth that we've been seeing around the world.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. Glenn, for a long time here, we've been asked on these calls, ""When are 
you going to get to 10% R
OE?"" And I think the main takeaway here is that 
-
-
 
our view is we're not going to be below 10% ROE. So that's sort of number 
one, which is, frankly, a pretty important inflection point for this firm post 
crisis. We were obviously higher than that pre
-
crisi
s, but we also operated 
with leverage of 30, 40, 44x. We're operating with leverage of 11x. And 
we're confident in setting a target that says we'll be at 10% or greater. And 
we put a range out there for lots of reasons, including the ones you're 
alluding t
o. We don't know exactly where rates are going to be. We don't 
know exactly whether global GDP is going to be growing at 4%, 3.5%, 3%. 
We don't exactly the impact of the U.S. tax reform on corporate earnings.
 
There are a lot of unknowns. But we're pretty c
onfident, based upon our 
business mix, our presumed corporate tax rate, taking into account there's 
still a lot of questions around that, and where the global economic growth is 
that we will generate above 10%. Whether it will be 10%, 11%, 12% or 
13%, that
 
obviously will be driven by economic environment. If we get 
faster rate increase, that helps our deposits and rate trading business. If we 
get regulatory relief, which is not embedded in this, that helps the 
denominator. If we get continued global economi
c growth, synchronized 
growth at 3
-
plus percent, then clearly, we are, like our competitors, highly 
correlated to GDP growth. So all of those things, all of those things start to 
play in it.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
I appreciate that. The one quick follow
-
up is on the
 
tax rate. I get it. This 
has got to be super complex, but I'm curious what might be the big items 
that would push you towards the top or the bottom of that range in terms of 
what gets allowed, disallowed in the future.
 
James Gorman
 
Jon might have more det
ails on it, but I think it's a little premature to try 
and parse that right now. The big takeaway is this firm has operated with a 
31%, 32% global tax rate. Over time, we have become more U.S.
-
centric, 
not less, frankly, by design, built around our strateg
y of being in the Wealth 
Management business, which is probably 98% U.S., something like that. 
Now 
--
 
we sold our European business several years ago. So we've sort of 
labored under a pretty high global tax rate. There aren't many institutions 
that are ope
rating with 32% or above global tax rates. Certainly, there 
aren't many U.S. institutions. So we are a clear beneficiary of this, and we 
have established range with a lot of rules. I'm not going to get into all of the 
details yet, and I think that's for ou
r accountants to work through, but we 
thought it appropriate to put a range around it just not to get too cute.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham 
Research.
 
James Mitchell
 
Just a quick question. I guess, is t
here an impact from Steinhoff or I guess, 
the appropriate euphemism is a single client. Did you have any issues this 
quarter with that?
 
James Gorman
 
With Steinhoff? No, we did not.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, no.
 
James Mitchell
 
Okay, so there's no impact 
there. Okay, that's great. And then maybe bigger 
picture on efficiency ratio. The gross
-
up in PBT in '18 on the accounting 
change. Can you give us 
--
 
help us a little bit more on specificity around 
that? What would the efficiency ratio be in '17 with that?
 
Or put some 
numbers around it or somehow help us think about what you're efficiency 
target means in the context of that change.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. So as James mentioned, the new revenue rec rules will primarily affect 
Investment Banking as well as Inve
stment Management. I think I said in the 
script, the 72.6% would have translated to approximately 73% efficiency 
ratio for the firm. Again, it's going to be a function of activity levels and 
expenses related to deals, which is what's driving the biggest ch
ange, but 
sort of in that 40 basis points, which is about $400 million plus or minus 
both to the revenue and the expenses. The other thing to note is that also 
we'll obviously have an impact on our comp ratio. While it increases the 
efficiency ratio, it de
creases the comp ratio slightly.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
First one on Wealth Management. Helpful to get an update on your targets 
here with the strategic review. Just curious on the 26% to 2
8% pretax 
margin target in wealth. You finished out this year 
--
 
or you generated 
25.5% this year. You've got in excess of 100 basis points tailwind from 
retention. You've got, as you highlighted, several other factors driving 
improvement there. So I guess
 
the question is, the lower end seems pretty 
conservative, particularly if we think about 2019 when those retention 
packages roll off. And you've got a primary competitor that's pointed to a 
30% long
-
term target, albeit no date tied to that. So is there an
y reason 
why you would think that competitors would have a higher margin upside 
than yours? And is the framing that the lower end is probably pretty 
conservative, fair on my part?
 
James Gorman
 
Brennan, competitors would not have a higher target than ours u
nless they 
had a very different deposit base, which at least one competitor does. But 
even with that, I think the scale in our business would suggest not. So that's 
fair. Number two, is it conservative? I guess, I'm coming from 
--
 
maybe I'm 
a little scarre
d from all the years when on these calls people used to ask if 
we'd ever get to 15% ROE. So I thought, in our dreams, if we put out a 26% 
to 28% ROE with revenue growth, that would 
--
 
sorry, margin growth, with 
revenue growth, that would be an extraordinar
y outcome. And here we are 
on the cusp of 2018, where I think you're right, if the markets cooperate and 
with the retention roll
-
off, although we don't know exactly how that all plays 
out, if the markets cooperate 
--
 
and retention roll
-
off, I think, is in 
January 
of '19 
--
 
2019, certainly the bottom end of this range, would be, I think 
you're accurate, it's a conservative number. But we live in a world of great 
uncertainty.
 
We're investing a fair bit in our digital platform. And the point we wanted to 
make 
in the introductory comments was, notwithstanding those 
investments, we've been able to keep the non
-
comp expenses actually 
slightly down over the time period. So yes, you're probably 
--
 
it's probably a 
fair characterization, but I wouldn't get ahead of th
e top end of this range. 
We got to 
--
 
a lot can happen in these markets, and I don't think we serve 
anybody well by just focusing on our margin. We've also want to focus on 
our revenue growth. And one of the things that was exciting about this 
businesses h
ere was just how much revenue growth there was.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Yes, no, that's all fair. And we won't quote you on the Freudian slip of 20
-
plus percent ROEs there. No problem.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, well that's not even Freudian. That's not even a bad dream. I 
mean, the 
only way you get a 20
-
plus percent ROE in these businesses is by doing 
something you don't want us to do right now.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
No, of course. Of course. I just couldn't help that. And then a follow
-
up on 
wealth. So we've all focused on the co
rporate changes to the tax code. But 
of course, individual tax code changed rather materially. Curious whether or 
not you're seeing an uptick in Wealth Management client engagement yet? 
Or do you expect that to pick up? And how are you prepping to ensure t
hat 
such request for advice would translate into an expansion of those critical 
relationships for you guys?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I would say a couple of things. Client engagement has been very high 
throughout the course of the year. We've seen, as markets globa
lly have 
been generally very strong, the cash in our clients' accounts has been down. 
And we're now at an equity level, in terms of the $2.4 trillion of client 
assets, that's really are in all
-
time high. Almost 54% of client assets are in 
equities, and tha
t's been steadily increasing since 2012. So there's been 
generally a lot of engagement throughout the course of the year. I think that 
will pick up and continues to pick up when there are major changes like this. 
And again, we think that our clients are lo
oking for advice, and we will 
engage with them. A lot of the investments that we made in digital has 
helped our offices and our FAs free up more time so they can focus on their 
clients and not work on some of the administrative responsibilities that they 
h
ave. And I think that's also going to lead to some of the growth momentum 
that we have in the margin and in the revenues. So topics like this are 
things for people who want to hear from their FAs and our clients 
--
 
or 
excuse me, and our FAs are out spendin
g time with their clients.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
You guys have done a very good job in increasing your market shares, 
particularly in trading and equity trading, even though the total 
wallet size 
has declined. Can you share with us the strategies you used to do that? And 
second, some of the European competitors have struggled, and they seem to 
be back on their feet. So should we expect the environment to get more 
competitive going forwa
rd?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I would say, just on the competitive environment, this is an extraordinarily 
competitive industry across all of our business segments. And where there's 
pockets of weakness maybe out of one geography, there's always someone 
trying to ge
t into the business or making a big push. So I think the 
competitive dynamic that we see hasn't changed dramatically. We compete 
effectively in this environment. And as you just said, we have been able to 
grow share. Again, I would say that the resulting s
hare gains across the 
major businesses is just a function of consistency, of client dialogue and 
engagement, putting our clients first, offering holistic solutions. Our global 
network has been in place for quite some time. And as people are allocating 
more
 
and more capital outside of the U.S., that global network has been a 
real competitive advantage. So I think it's just, again, some very basic 
blocking and tackling and staying in front of our clients as the global markets 
have changed.
 
James Gorman
 
I 
would just add on the 
--
 
particularly some of the global trading businesses. 
While some of the Europeans may be reinvesting, they tend to be 
reinvesting around banking and trading. It's my observation that there are 
still balance sheet questions that have 
got to be sorted out over time, the 
size of balance sheet. So I think you're right that there are probably a couple 
of institutions that would move forward in these businesses more 
aggressively than the last several years would suggest. But there's another
 
category, it's what I call the sort of a national champions. There are a lot of 
institutions that do very well in their home market. And from time to time, 
particularly in good trading markets, they have tried to expand that platform 
globally and generall
y, those situations sort of get washed out. They sort of 
retreat back to their home market.
 
Now obviously, I'm not going to name institutions, but these are global 
businesses, and they're expensive businesses. If you're not 
--
 
if you haven't 
got decent sha
re, they're very expensive. As we've proven in equities on the 
positive and we proved in Fixed Income on the negative. We've now 
addressed some of that with fixed income. So the pickup in market share is 
very welcome, but it was clearly part of the strateg
y that we had to get back 
to a sustainable level, which is kind of the zone that we're now operating in.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Very good. And then as a follow
-
up, Jon, you mentioned, you touched on the 
MiFID comments, that you're supporting the clients through Mi
FID. Is 
--
 
can 
you give us any idea of what type of revenue impact MiFID might have on 
you guys? Or is it too early at this point still?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think you answered your question. It is too early. We believe it's 
manageable given the size of your 
franchise. There hasn't been any real 
disruption in the trading environment. And in terms of the long
-
term impact, 
it's way too early to call. But we are #1 in the world in this business, and we 
think we're well positioned to handle it.
 
Operator
 
And our ne
xt question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
Can you guys hear me?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
You guys have talked about potentially doing acquisitions within the asset 
management area. And I'm just wonde
ring like as you step back, can you 
think about kind of the new regulatory environment, global growth picking 
up, what other areas are you thinking about strategically investing, maybe 
one you wouldn't before? And then kind of a subsegment of that, are the
re 
areas that you're interested in taking a little more risk than maybe you had 
in recent years, given the better macro backdrop and regulatory backdrop?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So again, I think we've been broadly investing in the franchise across all of 
the busi
nesses. Investment Management is still an area that we'd like to 
continue both organically and inorganically look at opportunities; and if 
something comes around, like the Mesa West, which was a good cultural fit, 
good product fit and fit very nicely into 
the franchise. I would say, broadly, 
in the other businesses, clearly, we think there is some probably opportunity 
geographically in ISG. On the organic side, we'd like to continue to invest in 
Asia as people put more capital into that region as transparen
cy and liquidity 
improves. So I think there's an opportunity for us, but I don't think that 
would be, per se, acquisitive. That might be more organic. And then on the 
advisory 
--
 
excuse me, on the Wealth Management side, as we said, we are 
at scale. So we 
don't need to do anything there, but there could be some 
--
 
could be interesting opportunities. We have plenty of capital and capacity to 
do things, which puts us in a good position. So I think we'll continue to 
invest in the businesses and drive continued
 
returns.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
And then from a risk
-
taking point of view, are you more open to maybe 
taking bigger hold positions within the loan book? Or just how are you 
thinking about risk
-
taking kind of broadly speaking? I mean, it never feels 
good 
--
 
neve
r kind of seems like a thing to say that you're willing to take 
more risk, but it's like the industry has been derisking for several years, 
including yourself. And now you've got lots of capital, lots of liquidity. 
There's opportunity to optimize the CET1 
versus the SLR. So around the 
edges, are there some areas that you're willing to take a little more risk than 
a few years ago?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen, as you say, we have derisked the franchise, improved our capital and 
liquidity positions. We're always th
ere to support our clients. We have 
significant risk capacity. To the degree client activity picks up, we'll be there 
to support them. You saw our VaR number is really at a multiyear low. So 
we do have the capacity to increase, but it's going to be a funct
ion of what 
clients want to engage in.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura 
Instinet.
 
Steven Chubak
 
I wanted to start off with a question on the investment strategy. And I 
know, Jon, you had just made some remarks
 
on this topic. But Wealth 
Management in recent years, it's certainly been helped by your strong 
expense discipline. You spoke about your ability to make investments in 
digital technology while keeping that expense base flattish. And I'd say 
you've been a 
positive outlier relative to a lot of your peers in that regard 
within that business. I'm just curious, underlying the 26% to 28%, which 
James, you noted as conservative, what assumptions are you making on 
non
-
comp inflation? And then in addition to that, 
since it's been asked by a 
few investors, maybe you could speak to deposit beta assumptions in that 
segment as well.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. Again, what we've been able to do in wealth, a, it's a very large 
business with $15 billion
-
odd of revenues, and we g
rew it at 10%. So we 
had significant revenue growth behind the margin improvement. Two, as 
we've been able to rein in non
-
comp expenses, we have been reinvesting. If 
we hadn't reinvested, actually, the noncomps would have gone down pretty 
dramatically. As 
you know, recruiting generally drives some of that expense 
leverage. And as deals have burned off and we have the biggest chunk of 
our deals burning off in January of '19, but deals have burned off every year 
as we hire people. And so we've been able to re
invest those savings, which 
is a comp number, and put it into our digital and bank platform. So I would 
expect that noncomps will grow but at a much slower pace than revenues, 
and we will continue to see operating leverage and the benefits of scale. And 
no
w I forgot your first question.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Deposit beta.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Deposit beta. Thank you. So listen, we had 3 hikes last year. And if you look 
at it over the course of the full year, betas were pretty low and realized 
betas were much lower 
than our projected model beta of 50%. We raised 
rates across our network in the second quarter, which I think was the 
second rate hike of the year. And it went from an average of about 1 basis 
point to, I think, about 6 or 7. So that was a 5 basis point, 6
 
basis point type 
of move on the 25 basis points. But over the full year, it was even lower 
because of the averaging effect. On the heels of this last rate hike, in 
December, across the platform, we raised rates by about, on average, 10 
basis points. So yo
u've basically gone from a virtual 0 beta to a 20 beta to a 
40 beta. So again, I think the betas are going to start to look a lot more like 
our expected modeled betas of about 50%. But certainly, they're higher than 
they were last year.
 
James Gorman
 
Let me
 
just add in a couple of comments about the margin because I didn't 
-
-
 
I don't want you to misunderstand us. I don't think the range of 26% to 
28% is conservative. I think 
--
 
what I was suggesting was, given what's 
going on in the business, the bottom end 
of that range, we think, is very 
doable and we should achieve it. In my recollection, and maybe I'm wrong, 
but I think there's only one firm in the history of the Wealth Management 
business, and I'm aware of its size, that has generated margin above 28%. 
A
nd that was, in fact, Smith Barney. And I think it was in 1999, and it was 
right before the dot
-
com bust. And it's when retail investors were trading at 
a level that was both unprecedented and unhealthy. So now the business 
models have changed a lot since 
then. There's all the banking deposits, et 
cetera, et cetera. But just for historical context, a 29% margin outside of 
this range would be the first time in the history of the industry. So I think we 
got to be a little cautious here. I'm much more interest
ed in trying to drive 
revenue growth in that business at 7% with a 27% margin than at 3% with 
a 28% margin.
 
So the playoff between revenue growth and margin expansion are the 2 
things that we've got to keep in mind here. That said, we put the range out 
the
re because that's what we think we will achieve over these 2 years.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Fair enough, James. Thanks for clarifying your remarks there. Just one more 
for me on capital. To follow
-
up to Glenn's question, you noted that you 
expect no meaningful chang
e in equity or the ROE denominator as part of 
the targets that you've outlined. It's pretty clear that you're more than 
adequately capitalized at this point. Just wondering, if you do, in fact, have 
some favorable regulatory changes as outlined by the trea
sury, do you see 
sufficient capacity to actually shrink that denominator over time while still 
balancing that with the need to remain prudent on capital and liquidity?
 
James Gorman
 
Again, I think it's a very fair question. We've been through many years of 
CCAR now. You look at our Core CET1 ratios. Core capital ratios are very, 
very strong. The one that's been closely aligned has been the leverage ratio. 
It remains 
--
 
I don't think a lot is going to change in 2018. 2019 going 
forward, it remains unclear whe
ther there will be any regulatory changes to 
which of the ratios are the more dominant ratios or not. There's some 
suggestion of that. There's some suggestion that maybe 
--
 
it's something we 
have pushed for a long time, to growing the balance sheet under t
he CCAR 
models. And I think 4% a year, frankly, makes no sense. There's no way 
your balance sheet's going to grow unless you're acquiring somebody during 
a time of severe economic stress. So if that were to happen, that obviously 
impacts our leverage ratio
 
a lot.
 
Our current payout, I think, is around 90 
--
 
I'm looking at Jon, about 95%, 
thereabouts. We're accreting higher than the payout ratio that we're putting 
out right now. So at a minimum, we would 
--
 
we are big believers in not 
hoarding capital unnece
ssarily. So at a minimum, you would expect to see 
those kinds of payout ratios. And then, yes, if we got some serious change, 
we think, as an institution, we're over capitalized. We think we're over 
capitalized by several billion dollars. And frankly, on a
 
global basis, I think 
there's a lot that would support that. So if we got some change that allowed 
us to take action on that, I think that's something 
--
 
in the absence of 
finding better ways to invest it or better things to buy, we believe in being 
very 
shareholder friendly on this stuff.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with 
Autonomous Research.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
First question is on FICC. You guys have been very on point over the last 
couple of years in terms of your wal
let view and the fact that it would be 
stuck. But I was interested in 2 comments. One, that there was a lot of 
operating leverage built into the system if it began to grow again, and then 
one that I think James made during the strategic presentation to the
 
effect 
that 
--
 
and it sounded like you believe that, at this point, the wallet could 
expand, I guess, on normalization of vol or something. But I was wondering 
if you could elaborate on how you're thinking about that.
 
James Gorman
 
I mean, Guy, given your 
reference to my comments, I'll start. And first, I 
just want to acknowledge the job the team did with Sam Kellie
-
Smith, who 
we put in to run FICC from equities; Ted Pick, who's now overseeing both 
equities, which is the #1 franchise, and Fixed Income; and 
of course, Colm 
Kelleher, our President, who's overseen this transition over the last several 
years. I think that group has done a phenomenal, phenomenal job and the 
team working with them. I think what we're seeing in fixed 
--
 
what we said 
in Fixed Income
 
was, if we couldn't generate on average and we fully 
expected we'd have quotas that wouldn't meet the average, in fact, fourth 
quarter didn't meet the average, but on average, $1 billion a quarter, we 
had a real open question about whether we've taken the
 
right strategy when 
we downsized 25%, was it enough, was it too much, et cetera, et cetera. 
And we feel really good about where that's been.
 
On average, for two years now, for 8 quarters, we've generated $1.25 
billion, I think, on average. I think it's be
en 5 years 
--
 
$5 billion roughly plus 
or minus for both years. And as we anticipated, there's some volatility. I 
think we have one quarter in there maybe a year ago where it's around $1.7 
billion. And we had a quarter like the last one, where it's a bit ov
er $800 
million. We didn't get 
--
 
we don't get too anxious about that. We're not 
trying to make Fixed Income a $3 billion a quarter business. So we're not 
going to be disappointed when it's not. What we wanted was it to be on 
average. Now what's happened a
nd what we tried to talk about in the 
opening comments was the market environment last year was tougher. The 
industry [ph] reported revenues were down, and the team picked up share 
against that. Projecting forward, I think we'd say 2 things. Obviously, we'
re 
keen to hold on to that share, but that can be frankly a mix of macro, micro 
and all the sub businesses. But secondly, we think that the 
--
 
with the global 
movement, particularly in the U.S. in rates, and just look where the 10
-
year, 
I think it was over
 
2.60% this morning, we're at 2.20% a month ago 
roughly, you're getting some activity into the rates market. Our credit 
complex has held up very well. Our SPG business is a terrific business. So do 
we think that the global revenues pick up? Yes, we do. And
 
do we think that 
we hold our share or something close to this share with that? Yes, we think 
that's reasonable. And with that by definition, you've got a significant 
potential upside in this. But we're not counting on that. We can't predict the 
revenues. 
We're not going to. And the good news is, we sit here saying, ""If it 
doesn't play out that way, we're fine with it."" I mean, we always want more, 
but we've got these other businesses for good reasons. And they will 
--
 
they 
are much more stable in these mar
ket environments. Jon, I don't know if 
you want to add, too.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No, I think that's right. For two years, we put up on average $5 billion when 
we saw better markets and we saw worse markets. And we do believe there 
will be volatility in this bu
siness quarter
-
to
-
quarter, but we feel good at the 
position that we're at. And we think that in an improving market, which 
again, early days, if you just look at the 10
-
year, if you look at rate 
expectations or [indiscernible], they've all picked up a litt
le bit here. But in a 
better market backdrop, we would expect to participate in that recovery. We 
have capacity to do that. And we'll have to see where the year plays out. But 
in a rising market, we do expect to play in that.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
That was really
 
helpful. And then the follow
-
up question would be on the 
theme of reinvestment. Obviously, that's driven a lot of conversations with 
investors over the last few weeks. Discrete type of benefits like taxes. Or in 
your case, one of the things that's coming 
up in a year or so is the runoff of 
the retention contracts in Wealth Management. Specifically to that, why 
should we not think that you would have to reinvest most of that in ongoing 
recruiting and retention?
 
James Gorman
 
Most of the runoff?
 
Guy Moszkowsk
i
 
Yes, in the retention. The 100 basis points or so in runoff of those contracts 
that would otherwise just fall to the bottom line.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, I mean, because those deals were put in place for a very specific 
reason, I think that about 6,000 of our
 
financial advisers back when we did 
the deal out of 18,000 and now put in place because we recognize, 
particularly for our advisers with larger complex books, it was a lot of 
dislocation. We took basically everybody, 16,000 advisers and tens of 
thousands 
of assistant, support staff in the branches and we put them on a 
completely new system. They had to learn new protocols. They had to 
--
 
they had a new user interface, so dealing with a new financing planning tool. 
It was a lot of dislocation for them and t
heir clients. And we felt it was only 
fair to do that. Once your business is normal, you don't have 
--
 
we don't pay 
our investment bankers retention payments. We don't pay our sales traders. 
We don't pay our risk managers, and we don't pay our financial ad
visers. 
That's just not business as normal. So we won't be doing that. This has been 
9 years we amortized [indiscernible] deals are paid partly upfront and partly 
over time. And it's been a very happy result for our advisers. They deserved 
it. And obviousl
y, thrilled that they got this. But that's not business as usual.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
 
Michael Mayo
 
James, I think you gave me this answer before. So the answer is a journey 
of 1,000 miles 
begins with a single step. The question is, why aren't your 
new targets even higher?
 
James Gorman
 
Oh my God, Mike Mayo. We've got a target 
--
 
I thought you'd be calling up 
to say you finally have a 10% plus target.
 
Michael Mayo
 
Well, listen to my thought p
rocess and correct where you think I'm wrong, 
and I think the answer is going to be partly because you're reinvesting. But 
you're at a 9.4% ROE in 2017. And with the new lower tax rate, you're in 
your new range of 10% to 13%. Your efficiency target of unde
r 73%. You're 
at 73% in 2017. And Wealth Management, the margin 
--
 
again, it's great 
progress this decade, but your range is 26% to 28%, and you're already at 
25.5%. And with the expiration of some of the contracts, you'll be in range. 
So it looks like it'
s just looking at your results in 2017 and the things that 
are definite that you should make your new 2018 to 2019 target. So I guess, 
my question is, are your new targets high enough?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, listen, it's a fair question. I think 
--
 
just step b
ack from it a minute and 
think about how we operate as management. We don't do less because 
we're suddenly getting ahead of one of our targets. We don't stop and not 
work. So if we can produce results above and beyond these results, we're in 
that all day l
ong. We're all shareholders. We're highly motivated. Senior 
management is paid. A lot of their compensation is based on performance 
units, which is tied to 
--
 
half of it's tied to ROE, half tied to total shareholder 
returns. So we are all in on delivering 
better results than what we've publicly 
said. On the other hand, we don't have credibility as a management team if 
we put out things which are artificially designed so that to boost confidence.
 
But we have a low degree of confidence that in a more challeng
ed 
environment, a more 
--
 
these market environments don't always go in a 
straight line and things happen in these businesses. We're pretty 
comfortable we can achieve these targets in a more challenged 
--
 
not a 
difficult, not a major recession, but certainl
y a more difficult market 
environment. And I think it's in that context that we put the lower end of the 
ranges. But 
--
 
and thirdly, we're just dealing with a lot of uncertainty. We 
don't know 
--
 
I think the regulatory bias will be to provide some relief o
ver 
time. I don't know that. We might be wrong. I think that interest rates 
--
 
there's [indiscernible] be more than two Fed hikes this year. We don't know 
that, and we are projecting that, that would be absorbed by the market, and 
we wouldn't tip the count
ry into recession, we can't predict all of that. We 
think that we are investing at the right level for our businesses, but we don't 
know that.
 
And maintaining an efficiency ratio of under 73%, when I think we started 
this 
--
 
I forget the number, but it was
 
over 80%. If we have good revenue 
growth and invest behind the business and still keep our efficiency rate 
under 73%, that would be a terrific outcome. So I think we're just 
--
 
it's not 
like several years ago when we started off in quite a stress situatio
n and we 
felt like we needed to show investors that we could be okay. We're more 
than okay now. And I think we've got to be smart about this and leave 
ourselves and all of you the room for us to invest where we find sensible 
opportunities. And at the end o
f the day, our results, well, we've got these 
'18, '19 targets. We have much longer time frame that we are focused on as 
a firm.
 
Michael Mayo
 
Just one short follow
-
up. I know you're not relying on this, but Jon, you 
mentioned high confidence that trading w
ould not remain at the low fourth 
quarter level. What are some items that you're looking at that gives you that 
confidence? And how has trading been so far this year?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, very, very early days. Only the 18th, and I think 11 trading days 
to 
date. But level of engagement with clients across the complex, as James 
mentioned, the 10
-
year now backed up over 20 basis points in the last 2 
weeks. We've seen expectation in rate hikes going from 2% to 2.5% in the 
last 2 weeks. We've seen rate volati
lity and FX volatility increase in the last 
2 weeks. So very early days. But there is signs that from a sales and trading 
perspective, we are seeing heavy levels of engagement and a little bit more 
vol and a little bit more activity. And we're obviously in
 
earnings season. So 
there's just more stuff going on. So we feel good about the start, but very 
early days.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Just one on the taxes. So
 
just given the range of the 22% to 25%, just 
--
 
how are you guys thinking about all that drop to the bottom line versus 
reinvesting in the business and the employee base over time? And then Jon, 
just on the 22% to 25%, does that include some of the noise 
that we'll see 
from quarter
-
to
-
quarter in the equity comp accounting? I just want to make 
sure that, that either is or isn't. Because some of the firms are kind of 
disclosing the ranges a bit differently.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'll take the second part first on 
the actual tax rate. So as you rightfully point 
out, 22% to 25%, I think is 
--
 
not I think, is the full year target. There will 
be volatility around that number and in the first quarter because tomorrow, I 
think, is our vesting event, which is the main com
ponent of the stock that 
we'll vest over the course of the year. We'll expect a tax rate lower than 
that. And then again, clarifications around some of the new regs, earnings 
mix, geography, all of that will sort of fluctuate, but the first quarter will be
 
our best quarter from a tax rate. And then we think it stabilizes more in the 
range that we gave you, the 22% to 25% in the out three quarters.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. On the reinvestment, it remains to be seen. But frankly, I don't think 
it's something that ch
anges our view of overall compensation in a material 
way. We pay on performance, and we pay based on the firm's performance 
and how we're doing in each of our businesses. For opportunities to invest, if 
we find attractive opportunities to invest in that we
 
think we can generate 
high returns on, we'll invest. And if we don't, we'll give the money back to 
shareholders. That's shareholders have been hanging in on this up for a long 
time to generate good returns. And this is one of the things that we'll hope 
ge
nerate that. So good opportunities to invest in, we'll take them. Look after 
our employees, absolutely. We expect to pay competitively always. And 
second 
--
 
and thirdly, absent those 2 things, it will go back to shareholders.
 
Operator
 
Our next question com
es from the line of Fan Yang with HSBC.
 
Fan Yang
 
What are the drivers of the net interest margin in the Wealth Management? 
If you have, for example, 3 rate hikes next year, how much of it do you 
expect to flow through to your net interest margin? And espec
ially on the 
funding cost, do you expect the deposit beta to increase as well with each 
rate hike?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So on the NII within wealth, you 
--
 
as you know, we've actually grown that 
line pretty dramatically over $2.5 billion in the last 5 years, so averaging 
about $500 million per annum. And that's been a function of growing the 
loans and deploying our excess l
iquidity. As we continue to penetrate our 
client base with the loan product, our expectations is that there's still room 
to grow the loan book within wealth, probably at a little slower rate, given 
some of the dynamics around rising rates in mortgage and t
he transition 
that we're going through. But we grew loans by over $7 billion last year. We 
would hope to continue to grow. It's also over a bigger base. So the 
percentage increase will decline. So we'll continue to see NII growth driven 
by loan growth. As 
I mentioned earlier, we do expect the betas to be higher 
this year than last year. And because of the funding mix, it's shifting a little 
bit away from the core single product that we used to have 2 or 3 years ago 
to a more diversified liability structure.
 
We will see an increase in the 
funding costs. But bottom line, NII will grow. It will just grow at a slower 
pace than 2017.
 
Fan Yang
 
And then what about on the margin basis? Is the absolute amount will grow? 
Will the margin grow as well due to the rate hi
kes? [Indiscernible]
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
By definition, yes. I mean, again, we don't look at sort of a net interest 
margin in the wealth business. But by definition, we would expect the yields 
to grow faster than the interest expense. So we'll have improvement
 
in the 
NIM, which we don't really track.
 
Operator
 
And our last question will come from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP 
securities.
 
Devin Ryan
 
One here just on tax reform. I mean, a lot of talk about better client 
engagement or sentiment across the busines
s as a result, and it would seem 
to me maybe that most directly impacts U.S. clients. But are you seeing that 
maybe positive sentiments build into better engagement abroad? What are 
the puts and takes there? I'm asking more about outside of the U.S. And 
th
en also, where does GWM expansion outside of the U.S. fit into the kind of 
the priority list, if at all?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen, I think tax reform broadly being accomplished those two things, one, 
the positive benefits that we just all talked about, but t
wo, eliminate an 
uncertain outcome. And when uncertainties get reduced, you generally see 
higher activity levels. So I do think this will be helpful overall to the M&A 
franchise and some of the other things that corporates are looking at around 
the world a
s they now know what the new corporate tax rate is going to look 
like and they can make informed decisions. Broadly speaking, again, CEO 
confidence is very high. The data suggests continuation of global growth and 
sort of very positive macro. I think 
--
 
so
meone told me this the other day, 
so if it's wrong, we can blame someone else, but of the 192 participants in 
the IMF, 186 are experiencing growth around the world. So we've not seen 
that I think ever. So again, I think people feel pretty good about the gl
obal 
growth picture, and we see significant client dialogues and engagement.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow
-
up here on the NII questions. 
Where do you think you are in the securities
-
based loan opportunity or 
penetration there? And the
n just kind of bigger picture, just given where the 
interest rate curve is and what we're seeing happening on kind of the longer 
end, what would make you think differently about the duration of the book 
or that as an opportunity?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think fr
om a penetration standpoint, we saw a couple of billion dollars of 
growth in the SBL product the last couple of years, and we think that we'll 
continue to see that type of level of growth. Obviously as a percentage 
basis, it's slowing. But absolute number 
has been pretty consistent over the 
last couple of years. And if you look at our penetration and activity levels at 
FA at that level, again, we still believe that there's incremental growth in 
that product. Number one, in terms of our overall positioning h
asn't changed 
very much. As you said, I think there is a view, whether right or wrong, of 
somewhere between two and three rate hikes for 2018. I think there is a lot 
of disagreement potentially on the shape of the curve and what happens in 
the middle to th
e long end. But from our positioning standpoint, we haven't 
really increased our duration very much, and our interest rate risk profile 
hasn't changed that dramatically.

James Gorman
 
Thank you, Kathleen, good 
morning everyone and thank you for joining us. 
The second quarter was very solid across our businesses. We grew earnings 
year
-
over
-
year 34% excluding DVA and the prior year quarter net discrete 
tax benefit, and as a result, delivered an ROE ex
-
DVA of 9.1% 
for the 
quarter.
 
We also continue to execute on our strategic plan and deliver on our stated 
goals. Once again equities was a notable highlight driven by strength in 
cash, derivatives and prime brokerage across the globe.
 
Banking was strong. We finished th
e quarter ranked number one in global 
IPOs, number two in announced M&A. In particular, we delivered strong 
performance in fixed income underwriting. The pipeline remains healthy. In 
fixed income and commodities, we continue to deliver improving results.
 
O
ur fixed strategy remains unchanged and we continue to execute on our 
strategic plan to reshape fixed
-
income and commodities into a more focused 
business. We have reduced balance sheet, risk weighted assets, and 
expenses while maintaining a client focus co
nsistent with our strategy. We 
believe the recent two notch upgrade and some of the developments in the 
competitive landscape may give rise to additional opportunity.
 
In Wealth Management, we remain on plan and delivered a 23% margin. 
Consistent with our s
trategy, we also completed the final stage of deposit on 
boarding and now have close to $140 billion of deposits. We continue to 
deploy those deposits as part of our bank lending strategy, an important 
component of our future performance and growth.
 
Finall
y, in Investment Management, we delivered a strong quarter that 
benefited particularly from investment gains in merchant banking and real 
estate investing. As recent market volatility, particularly driven by events in 
Greece and China has demonstrated, the
 
near
-
term landscape can change 
quickly. This kind of short
-
term volatility does not change our long
-
term 
strategy.
 
Our trading performance can, of course vary meaningfully in the near
-
term, 
the stability of our fee
-
based businesses gives us comfort that a
 
large 
portion of our business offers us a more predictable outlook. Furthermore, 
given our business mix we are overweight the U.S. and benefit from the real 
and sustainable recovery that is taking place. This balance positions us to 
continue to live up fo
r our clients and our shareholders.
 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Jon to discuss the quarter in 
detail.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thanks, James. Good morning everyone. I'll review our quarterly financial 
performance and business results and then James 
and I will be happy to 
take your questions. Before I discuss the individual businesses, I will first 
make a few comments on our overall performance.
 
Revenues were $9.7 billion in the second quarter or $9.6 billion excluding 
DVA. Revenues are up nicely this
 
quarter, 13% versus second quarter 2014 
or 12% excluding DVA. Against that revenue backdrop, we were able to 
keep expenses well
-
managed up 5% year
-
over
-
year demonstrating 
operating leverage in our business. The efficiency ratio was 72% in the 
second quart
er and we remain very focused on expense management both 
in terms of comp and non
-
comp expenses.
 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 33% this quarter due to our 
geographic mix of earnings and given that we would guide you to an 
effective tax rate of 3
2% for the rest of 2015.
 
ROE was 9.9% or 9.1% ex
-
DVA. We saw strength across certain products 
and geographies, but still have opportunities to improve results and we are 
keenly focused on our goal of delivering a sustainable 10% ROE.
 
Now to the businesses.
 
Our Institutional Securities franchise showed 
resiliency in the face of more challenging markets in the second quarter. We 
continue to see a gradual global recovery led by developed markets. Not 
surprisingly Europe was a softer market and we expect a cont
inuation of 
muted activity and volumes in the near
-
term.
 
We are optimistic about growth in the U.S. and see significant client 
engagement in greater China. Revenues were $5.2 billion or $5 billion 

ignificant 
portion of the decline is attributable to our commodities business where we 
saw less client engagement and lower volatility.
 
Non
-
interest expense was down 3% versus the first quarter. Excluding DVA, 
the compensation ratio was 38% below our state
d target of 39%.
 
In Investment Banking, we remain encouraged by the level of strategic 
activity and have seen an increase in the velocity and size of deals. Deal 

more cash deals. B
uyers are willing to move unilaterally and cross
-
border 
activity is up. Investor reactions to strategic transactions have been positive 
and this has led to nearly $2 trillion in global activity year
-
to
-
date.
 
For the quarter, revenues in Investment Banking 
were $1.4 billion, up 23% 
sequentially. As of June 30, Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global 
IPOs, number two in global announced M&A, and number four in U.S. 
investment grade debt. Notable transactions in the quarter include an 
advisory; Morgan Stanl
ey acted as financial advisor to Time Warner Cable on 
the announced acquisition by Charter Communications valued at $79 billion.
 
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley as lead left book runner priced 

e largest consumer 
electronics IPO in history. This transaction highlights Morgan Stanley's 
continued leadership in transformative technology IPOs.
 

sixth tranche $16.7 billion debt
 
offering to finance its previously announced 
acquisition. We delivered related debt, equity and risk management 
solutions around this offering. This transaction is a great example of our 
ability to deliver solutions for clients across M&A, capital markets
, and risk 
products, as well as the power of our partnership with MUFG who is involved 
in the initial bridge loan.
 
Turning to the individual businesses, advisory revenues of $423 million 
decreased 10% versus the first quarter driven by a decrease in the Am
ericas 
and EMEA, partially offset by increases in Asia. Underwriting revenues were 
strong at $1 billion driven by a pickup in primary equity issuance and an 
industry record for quarterly new issue volumes for U.S. investment grade 
debt, which was aided by 
an uptick in M&A related financing.
 
Equity underwriting revenues were up 59% versus first quarter, primarily 
reflecting increases in follow
-
ons, secondary sales, and IPOs. Fixed
-
income 
underwriting revenues were up 34% versus a strong first quarter. The 
pi
pelines are healthy and while the third quarter historically maybe 
seasonally lighter for capital markets; we think longer
-
term positive trends 
remain intact.
 
In equity sales and trading, our global footprint continues to serve us well. 
We saw particular s
trength in Asia, where we have leading market position 
and cash volumes were up significantly. Performance in the U.S. continued 
to be strong lead by prime brokerage and derivatives.
 
Equity sales and trading had another excellent quarter with $2.3 billion 
of 
revenue, driven by high levels of client activity across all products. Prime 
brokerage revenues increased in all regions quarter
-
over
-
quarter and 
derivative revenues remain strong, but were down off of the first quarter.
 
Our first half results in 
equities are a testament to the strength of our equity 
franchise and leadership team. We believe that we have a number one 
global position year
-
to
-
date driven by our focus on clients and best
-
in
-
class 
execution. We are confident in our position and strateg
y, although results 
will be a function of client activity and volumes.
 
In fixed
-
income and commodities this quarter, we further executed on our 
stated strategy. We remain focused on reshaping and optimizing this 
business, as well as on efficiency and how w
e manage all resources. For the 
quarter, fixed
-
income and commodity sales and trading revenues were $1.3 
billion excluding DVA, down 33% versus the first quarter.
 
As I noted before, a significant portion of the decline is attributable to our 
commodities bu
siness where we saw less client engagement and lower client 
activity. We also saw declines in EMEA off of a very strong first quarter 
which included the benefit of the start of QE.
 
Our rates business performed well, although down from the first quarter 
whi
le the environment for our traditionally strong credit businesses remain 
softer. We continue to be disciplined on risk weighted assets in end of the 
quarter at a $157 billion of FIC RWAs.
 
A meaningful portion of this decline was driven by a reduction in ri
sk as 
client activity decreased, while Greece dominated the headlines in the 
middle of June, as well as our continued passive roll off. We anticipate 
variability in RWAs, as client reengage and re
-
establish risk positions while 
staying below our target of 
$180 billion.
 
During the quarter, consistent with our strategy of exiting physical oil, we 
also announced the sale of our global oil merchanting business and expect 
that to close later this year.
 

at the market 
and our competitors are going through significant disruption, which brings 
both opportunities and challenges. We have reduced headcount, balance 
sheet, and RWAs, while remaining a full service global fixed
-
income partner 
to our top clients. R
ebuilding the business takes time, but year
-
to
-
date we 
have shown progress, in particular, in rates and foreign exchange, though 
there is more work to be done.
 
Other revenues were up versus last quarter driven primarily by fees and 
marks on our lending and
 
event book. Lastly, average trading bar for the 
second quarter was $54 million, up slightly driven by increased client activity 
and choppier markets.
 
Turning to Wealth Management. Our view remains positive as recovery 
further plays out in the U.S. We see 
steady performance in our business with 
growth coming from our bank strategy and fee
-
based programs. Revenues 
for the quarter were up 1% sequentially. Asset management revenues were 
up 3% from last quarter driven by higher fee
-
based client balances from 
po
sitive flows.
 
Global based asset inflows were $13.9 billion bringing total fee
-
based client 
assets to 18 
---
 
to $813 billion at quarter end, representing 40% of client 
assets. We continue to see softness in transactional revenues which were 
down 8% compare
d to last quarter, as retail investor activity has yet to 
increase from subdued levels.
 
Consistent with the execution of our U.S. bank strategy, net interest revenue 
increased 7% to $737 million, driven by growth in lending and realization of 
the forward c
urve in our Investment Securities portfolio.
 
Wealth Management lending balances grew $4 billion or 10% from the prior 
quarter. Non
-
interest expenses were essentially flat to last quarter and the 
compensation ratio was 57% driven by increases in non
-
compens
able 
revenues. As James mentioned in its comments, the PBT margin was 23%.
 
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $132 billion, down versus the 
first quarter reflecting seasonality. Wealth Management representatives were 
down 1% versus the first quarter
.
 
In Investment Management, revenues were up 12% sequentially driven by 
gains in the real estate and merchant banking business and total AUM ended 
the quarter at $403 billion.
 
Turning to balance sheet and capital, total assets were $825 billion at June 
30,
 
down from $829 billion at the end of the first quarter. In the last few 
weeks of June, the balance sheet came down as clients took risk off due to 
disruptions in the market.
 
Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $188 billion 
compared 
with $195 billion at the end of the first quarter. Our capital ratios 
continue to strengthen, reflecting our best estimates of the Federal Reserve 
final rules, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio, using the Basel III 
fully phased
-
in advance approach w
as 12.5% at June 30. Pro forma fully 
phased
-
in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $429 
billion, down from $448 billion in the first quarter.
 
We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the U.S. final 
rule to be approx
imately 5.3% at June 30, up from 5.1% at the end of first 
quarter. All of these estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision.
 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or 
approximately 16 million shares under our 2015 
CCAR approved higher level 
and our Board declared a $0.15 dividend per share.
 
To close my prepared remarks, we saw two different quarters in 2015 in 
terms of market dynamics, client activity, and volatility. Our global footprint 
and business mix were able 
to deliver stable results throughout these two 
quarters.
 
With that, we will open
-
up the line to questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn 
Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahe
ad.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi. Thanks very much. So you have done well across just about every 
business. I'm trying to get a feel for is, how much seasonality we should 

equities so strong and seco
nd half usual seasonality in FIC and the big 

guidance on how much of that we should expect moderating in the second 
half, just on seasonality?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, great. I think as you
 
said, Glenn, the business was much more 
balanced in the first half across all of our businesses and all of our products, 
in all our 
--
 
all of our geographies in terms of seasonality. All I would say is 
from a capital markets perspective, the third quarter
 
is usually seasonally 

 
Glenn Schorr
 
Maybe on the merchant bank and real estate, is that a function of sales or its 
just really good environment and having things to mark up?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, I think as 
you point out in merchant banking and our real estate 
business, we did see good principal gains in the quarter. It was a 
combination of both marks in distributions and it's been a good environment 
for monetizations here.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
James noted the two no
tch upgrade may help in FIC. Can we talk about 
specifically where and maybe also just flush out within FIC. Normally your 
great and strong credit 
--
 
obviously that was weaker, but your results held 
up really well to your point on rates and FX. Have 
--
 
do y

fully transitioned to a more balanced business?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 


with that result. Bu

level of performance in FIC. The balance 
--
 
the business was much balanced, 
much more balanced in the first half across products and geographies. You 
did point out that our historically strong credit
 
businesses and SBG 
businesses are a little bit softer. We did see strong results across regions in 
rates in the first half. The FX business was strong in the first quarter given 
the positive trend in volatility in the U.S., euro FX movements that did come
 
down a little bit in the second quarter as currencies traded in a tighter band 
and there was more muted volumes, but it was still a strong quarter for us. 

--
 

pleased with the progress tha
t we made and there is more to be done.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. Thanks so much.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please 
go ahead.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Starting out in c
apital markets, and Glenn touched on this a little bit, the 
Asian strength definitely a driver again this quarter. Maybe can you help us 
understand how much of a tailwind that was and then also given some of the 
volatility we have seen since the end of the
 
second quarter, how are clients 
reacting to that and what is your expectation for continued strength in the 
region?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. First I will comment our Asia
-
Pacific results and business, we are 
strong across all our businesses, equities, fixed 
income, and investment 
banking this quarter. We do have a diversified business not only in China, 

did benefit from activity levels being higher in China this quarter. We did se
e 
increased volatility there, but given the liberalization of the capital markets 

region. It's obviously a large and important region and has significant growth 
opportunities there
. So we would expect that level of engagement to 
continue. We saw lots of volatility in the second quarter. I would say that 
was more broadly dominated with some macro headlines towards the end of 
the year, not just in China, so we did see as we said risk 
positions come 
down and client engagement slow down a little bit in the back half of June 
and early parts of July. I would say we have started to see some of those 
headlines tied down and a little bit more stability in some of the volatility 
indexes come d

see some more reengagements by our clients and our investors. But I 

--
 

quarter, but we feel good about the client activity 
and the client 
engagement.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then on FIC, clearly year
-
to
-
date results 


rating 
here year
-
to
-

environment like this, and how much more juice there is for continued 
improvement there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

 
and optimizing that business. We are clearly focused on improving the ROE 

We think there is still more opportunity. Some of those opportunities include 
continuation of the bala
nce sheet optimization strategy that we have. We are 
very focused also on the velocity of our balance sheet and even though 

that area as well.
 
James Gorman
 
I would just add to t
hat, that obviously we have done a lot of internal 
restructuring both in cost and in balance sheet. Clearly we have a very 
focused stable team running our FIC business. We saw the two notch 

 
that to 

and the feedback from some clients is that over time it will be additive. And 
as others have observed in the global FIC investment banking sales trading 
marketplace, the
re is clearly more turmoil in other parts of world than there 
is in the U.S. and we think that there is potential for over a period of time 

really focus on 
--
 
I mean we obviously rep
ort on the quarterly basis, but we 

-
to
-

moving this business over a four or five year period and obviously the more 

 
Brennan Haw
ken
 
Yes. No, agreed. And then switching gears over to Wealth Management, the 
continued grind down in comp expense, how much of that 
--
 
is that purely 
mix driven? And then as we start to see some rate tail wind here, God 
willing, that only continues to supp
ort the mix shift, right. And then when 

about any change in loan growth with Citi's deposits all on boarded now?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So I think in our Wealth Management 
business the drivers are still pretty 

-
based businesses as well as the deposit deployment and the improvement in 

ocused 

NII and therefore non
-
compensable revenues. I believe the expense ratio 
came in 
--
 
the comp expense ratio came in at 57% this quarter. Our stated 
target is 55%, so we will co
ntinue to drive towards that target. PBT margin 
was 23%, so that was up nicely from the second quarter. In terms of our 
deposit deployment strategy and our excess liquidity in our banks, we still 
think that has room to play out and that will be a continuat
ion and the 
primary driver of our NII growth going forward. We saw $4 billion of loan 
lending balances increases in the Wealth Management business this quarter. 
We saw lending balances increase about $6 billion in totality, so we had

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with 
Autonomous. Please go ahead.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning. So we hear some commentary about potential for FIC share 
gains obviously there was some pre
ss a few weeks ago about whether or not 

balances in institutional and they are down about a couple billion dollars this 
quarter. I was wondering if you could help us understand how the t
wo things 
are trading off, the potential for perhaps more FIC engagement and market 

Institutional Securities group?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, let me just start with talking about the s
trategic issue and given that it 


newspaper. And I read a lot of things in the newspaper not knowing the 

a two notch upgrade. What is also true is that a number of institutions are 
going through a relook/restructuring of their fixed income businesses, which 
is obviously public. An
d thirdly what is true is that we have been through 
that process over the last several years and feel like we have a business 

know, Guy, about four years ago there were 390 billion I th
ink in FIC and 
there we just reported somewhere close in the 160s. So it may be even 


we are not going to be m



revenue side. So its 
--
 
we are not trying to make it more
 
complicated than 
that. This was a very solid quarter, not a sensational quarter in FIC. 
Obviously, the fact we are up year
-
over
-
year. It was important, but also to 
be honest a year
-
ago, we had a relatively light quarter. So we wanted to be 
up and we neede
d to be up and we proved we could be.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
And just a follow
-
up on the reduction and capital that 
--
 

currently to Institutional Securities. Is that as simple as what you talked 
about in the opening remarks, that the balance sheet
 
was smaller at the end 
of the quarter and it was going to kind of bounce around that way, or is 
there something more strategic going on with respect to for example, run
-
off 

down 
that FIC RWA, that's driving the 
--
 
almost $2 billion reduction in capital 
NIS?
 
James Gorman
 

about where we ended with the capital in the quarter.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Guy, I think 
your first comments were accurate regarding the balance sheet 
usage.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Okay. Fair enough. And then just a follow
-
up on that. A $1 billion increase in 

common equity or common equi

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, in terms of those disclosures I think you see a couple of things here. 
The parent is increased driven by the less segment usage as we just talked 
about plus the earnings accretion that w
e had and then the mix is driven by 
each segments relative contribution to the total.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Fair enough. And then just one more thing that was topical for investors 
during the quarter based on your 10
-
Q. I know you addressed it a little bit at 
you
r conference a few weeks ago, but maybe you can talk a little bit about 
the decline in interest rate sensitivity that was evident in your Q, the degree 
to which that might have reflected just a difference in asset deployment 
strategy, securities versus loa
ns, whatever and whether there are any risk 
management elements that we need to think about with respect to the 
change there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I think there is a couple of different questions in there. Maybe I can try 
to address them in two parts. Fir
st would just be our overall interest rate 
position and how we think about NII, and then the second part of the 
question really around the disclosures. Let me address the first one. As you 
heard from James, the on boarding of the Citi deposits came to conc
lusion 
this quarter. We brought on a little over $4 billion in the quarter and that 
program has now run its course. The NII was up nicely and we expect a 

the deposit deployment 
strategy. If you look in the supplement you will see 
that our investment portfolio was down about $5 billion this quarter and our 
lending balances were up $6 billion. I mentioned $4 billion of that from 
Wealth Management clients and $2 billion from Institu
tional Securities 

our January presentation where we laid out some illustrative asset yields you 
saw that our lending products were generating 150 to 250 basis points more 
of yield 
than our AFS or cash or short
-
term investments. So that is the 
primary driver of the improvements in NII. We are also starting to see the 
natural run
-
off in our investment portfolio being reinvested in higher rates 
and the realization of the forward curve 

quarter. And then lastly just on our overall interest rate positioning, our NII 
growth and results are in line and consistent with where we were in the 
beginning of the year in terms of our views. On the actual disclosure 
that we 
have in the Q, a couple comments there. First, you should know that we 

trying to optimize across the range of possible outcomes. The second 
comment about that disclosure is y


balance sheet and our interest rate positioning. That disclosure as you know 
is an instantaneous and parallel shock above the base case. So it is our
 
12 
month forward NII base case. The important thing to realize there is that our 
base case includes two critical things. One of them is our own, which is our 
deposit deployment strategy which is the primary driver of our NII growth 
and the second is we us
e the implied forward curve and today the implied 
forward curve has 225 basis points increases in the fed fund rates. So we 
have captured much of NII expectations already in our base case. And the 
last point I would make is that, that number and that discl
osure is going to 
move around as we manage our overall interest rate risk in the bank.

Your 
next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go

Michael Mayo
 
Hi. My first question is on Wealth Management. You said you have a $140 
billion of deposits of what's left to redeploy and we estimate a Wealth 
Management net interest 
margin of 2%. What would you consider a normal 
NIM for that business?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So in terms of the first part of your question Michael, I think as we said the 
deposit deployment strategy is one of the critical strategies in wealth and we 
still think that, that has plenty of room to play out here. We still have excess 
liquidity in the 
bank and we will be redeploying those cash balances into the 

question?
 
Michael Mayo
 

estimating 2%, but if you want 
to clarify that. But what do you think is the 
normal margin for lending in Wealth Management?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

strategy, part of that benefit of having the bank appears in Wealth 
Managem


that margin 
--
 
PBT in that business which came in at 23%, which is we said 
before was up nicely and we continu
e to hopefully make progress in that 
going into the future quarters.
 
Michael Mayo
 
So, where do you hope the 23% ratio to go over time?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 



to continue to try to make progress there both on the revenue side and the 
expense side.
 
Michael Mayo
 
Alright let me switch to Institutional Securities. Prime brokerage, you said 
has gone up in all regions, and w
e lack some transparency to see some of 
the data underneath. Can you just give us some sense as to whether its 
market share or a percentage increase or really just why. We know many 
clients left during the crisis. Is that still a factor people coming back 
or 
what's the underlying reason for that growth?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen, I think the underlying reason for the growth in all of our business is 

up around the world and around the
 
globe in terms of engagement with our 

the growth in our balances.
 
Michael Mayo
 
Okay. How about just a general question, the ROE on a core basis is 9%, 

ur peers and I know the target could get over 
10%. But what is the ROE still under 10% when half of your company is a 
lot more annuity like than some of your peers referring to wealth 
management, asset management being half, your ROE is still under 10%. If
 

change, what would it be?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, Mike firstly I admire your consistency in coming back to this question 

cus for us. 
Reason number one, not to be facetious is what our earnings are. Reason 
number two is, what our current capital is and reason number three is, what 
our ability to deploy that capital back to shareholders is has driven in large 
part by the CCAR 


capital as we have already this year significantly above what our presumed 
pay out and buy back plans are. So our ability 
to grow our ROE is both the 
function of improved earnings the firm is generating and the ability to right 
size that capital base for the business mix and model that we have. Through 
the first half of this year I think our ROE is running at about a 10% not 

we believe we should be running at 10 plus percent ROE business. When we 

has obviously been 
--
 
if y
ou look back over the last four years and you strip 
out some of the one time whether its MBIA, whether it was Revel, or 
whether it was the treatment of the deferred comp, whether it was some of 
the big litigation with Department of Justice, FHFA, you take 
all of those 
things out. Essentially the last four years ROEs have gone from 2%, 4%, 
6%, 8% pretty much in lockstep. And as I said the first half of this year 

quarter. So, nothing 


numerator and the denominator and the denominator is a little more 
complicated given the regulatory world we live in as you obvi
ously know.

All right. Thank you.

Good morning, Jon. Good morning, James.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good 
morning.
 
Christian Bolu
 
So, couple of questions on the longer term prospects of the Wealth 
Management business. So on the comp ratio, just like to get your thoughts 
on the competitive implications of driving the ratio below 55%. I do 
appreciate a lot of th
at is lending related, but I would imagine some of it 
also includes some comp rationalization. And what is the hypercompetitive 
environment for advisor recruitment? Does a lower comp ratio affect your 
ability to keep or attract high quality advisors?
 
James
 
Gorman
 

we think a lot about. Firstly the reduction in the comp ratio is 
overwhelmingly driven by the business mix as in non
-
compensable for 
revenues and by the cost structure, non
-
compensation expenses that we've 
realized some benefits and scale coming out of the integration a couple of 
years ago of the Smith Barney deal. The changes to the compensation for 

--
 
bu
t 
at the same time, I would say the recruiting environment the ins and outs 
has also been very modest. That is not, it might feel hypercompetitive 
because some of the wise run every time somebody moves from one firm to 
another they run a story on it, but a
ctually in the size of these firms now the 
competitive environment on recruiting is really pretty stable. So that's not 
what's going to be the big driver here. We are not changing the 
compensation models for financial advisors to drive those kinds of 
econo
mics. It's really business mix and it's the scalability of the business. 
Once you cover your fixed costs, the margins obviously improve.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Interesting. So, maybe just another question on that business and advisor 
growth remains weak, and you'v
e talked about trimming the lower producing 
FAs. But I'd like to get your thoughts on maybe growing that business via 
another transformative M&A deal. A number of European banks have very 
sub
-
scale presence in the U.S., businesses that look like they could
 
fit very 
well with yours. I would like to get your thoughts on maybe the appetite for 
in another deal and any pros and cons of doing a deal?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, Christian, I admire the question, but well obviously I wouldn't talk 
about deals on a call or c
orporate strategy like that. But suffice to say we're 
very conformable with business we've got and the size of the business, and 
we think the opportunity to improve margin with the business we have 
particularly by building out the bank and by organic growt
h within the 
businesses is extremely attractive to us. We had a desire to get to scale, and 
we are well and truly at scale. So we feel good about that.
 
Christian Bolu
 
I appreciate that. I just wanted to get maybe pros and cons of doing a deal, 
but I hear y
ou. And then just 
--
 
one last question, on other revenues within 
ISG, could you quantify how much loan marks contributed to revenues 
there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No, again, I think that the primary driver was the marks on the loans in the 
event book, but I think
 
that's where we will leave it.

Okay. Thank you, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please

Fiona Swaffield
 
Hi. I just had a quick question following up on the fix
ed income risk weighted 
assets. How much of the fall is due to the massive roll
-
down happening 
more quickly than expected, because I think that by the end of 2015, you 
were still thinking you're going to have $25 billion left to roll off. Has that 
changed 
at all?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, I would characterize reduction in RWAs, in FIC, really a meaningful 
portion of that was a decrease in client activity going into and through the 
Greece situation. There was some passive roll off, but it was really a mix of 
those two things and more geared towards the risk reduction of our clients.
 
Fiona Swaffield
 
Should we still [technical difficulty].

I was just checking whether we should still take the 1, 5, 7 and assume the

Jonathan Pruzan
 
No. I would tell you that, two things. One, we
've got a stated target of $180 

target. The actual quarter
-
to
-
quarter RWAs is really just going to be a 
function of the macro backdrop client activity and supporting our client
s. So 
that number can move around, but we're clearly going to operate within our 
target.

Steven Chubak
 
Hi. Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So was hoping to dig a little bit deeper into some of 
--
 
into the SLR in 
particular. It looks like you've reduced leverage exposure by 7% since the 

there, but just given the 
Fed's proposal from Friday which suggested that the SLR will likely be 
incorporated in CCAR. I just want to get a better sense as to how much 
incremental SLR mitigation potential you see on the horizon especially given 
the backdro
p for at least the planned strategy to continue to grow Morgan 
Stanley bank?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, as you noted the SLR did increase from the 5.1% to the 5.3% that was 
a combination of both some movement in the numerator and the 
denominator. On the numerat
or we obviously had the earnings accretion for 
the quarter, and on the denominator, not only did the balance sheet come 
down, but we also made some progress on the SLR add
-
ons. We're clearly 
comfortable with that ratio where it is today. That rule doesn't 
go into effect 
until 2018. And I would tell you that we're going to continue to manage our 
business across all of our capital ratios and continue to remain focused on 
having enough capital to grow our business.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Okay. And as a 
follow
-
up to that, Jon, just thinking more broadly when you 
look at the current regulatory landscape and the multiple constraints that 
you're managing too. What do you believe longer term represents Morgan 
Stanley's binding constraint, and how does that in
form your strategy in 
terms of where you see opportunities to better optimize those ratios?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well again, it's a complex question because we have multiple ratios. Clearly 
in terms of capital return our binding constraint is CCAR. CCAR 
continues to 
evolve quarter 
--
 
year
-
over
-
year, and we're going to continue to do our best 
to manage our capital ratio so we can return capital to our shareholders as 
well as continue to grow our business.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Okay. Thanks. And just one more for m
e on capital, with the Fed's proposal 
from Friday suggesting that the advanced approach will be deferred 
indefinitely in CCAR, I would appreciate if you could disclose, A; the current 
level of standardized RWAs, and B; how we should think about the traject
ory 
in standardized RWA in the context of some of the mitigation targets that 
you've laid out in the past?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
In terms of the 
--
 
I think we 
--
 
I mentioned in my remarks that the 
advanced RWAs was about $429 billion on a preliminary basis, stan
dardized 
is pretty close to that. It's about $420 billion. We've seen those numbers 
converge over the last several quarters. In terms of the proposal that was 
put out on Friday, clearly having clarity and simplification around some of 
the initiatives is ve
ry helpful. The delay in the SLR as you said the delay in 


and any time there are changes. We obviously 
have to go through a process 
and model validation and pattern recognition, and so when there are fewer 
changes it's easier for us just to continue running those models as we've 
been doing in the past. But overall I think it's too early to comment on the 
ov
erall 2016 CCAR. This is A; only a proposal, and B; we haven't seen the 
scenarios or the final instruction. So while this has been positive because it 
keeps the model similar to what it was last year it's too early to comment 
overall on the process.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Good morning, and thank
s guys. The first question, just on the expenses 
and your operating leverage, just looking year
-
over
-
year I think your 
revenues are up around 12%, expenses up 5%, the margins are around 
27%, 28%. So just, when you think about going forward, in a positive 
r
evenue environment, I just wanted to get an update on some of the targets 
that you had for like the comp ratios by segment and probably more 
importantly on the non
-
comp side, because that's been fairly well managed, 

round legal in the past. But just 
when you think about areas where you're still working on efficiencies versus 
some incremental spend in the business, whether it's on growth or 
regulatory initiatives. I just wanted to get an outlook on like incremental 
mar
gins in a positive revenue trending environment.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I think there are a couple questions there. In January, James laid out 
specific comp targets. They were 39% in ISG; we were at 38% for the 
quarter. They were 55% in Wealth Management, a
s I mentioned they were 
at 57% in the quarter. And we laid out a target of below 40% in Investment 
Management and its running slightly above that I think about 41%. So 
again, tightly managing compensation, our non
-

not sure we h
ave specific targets, but we as I said been very focused on 
non
-
comp expenses. We've been trying to support the business growth so 
the level of activity will drive that number. Obviously the level of regulatory 
change will also drive that number, but we've
 
been very focused on keeping 
a tight lid on expenses and we will continue to do that going forward.
 
James Gorman
 
And I would just add that the 
--
 
what should be obvious to everybody is 

ed 
costs, you'd be hard pressed to grow your non
-
comp expenses absent legal. 


said, there are certain par
ts like brokerage and clearing, certain marketing 
development which do go up as revenues go up, but there's a heck of a lot 
of it that doesn't which gives you the incremental margin is always going to 
be higher than the existing margin.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Oka
y. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow
-
up on the Wealth 
Management business, just two things there. Just on the transaction 
revenues, what type of an environment would you start to see that pick up? 


been more the industry. But I just wanted to get, what do you think the big 
driver, the weakness there is? And then second is, just on the DOL proposal 
on the common period, do you think its getting ready to close. So I just 
w
anted to get an update on your guys view on some of the challenges or the 
opportunities if that precedes into the back half of this year.
 
James Gorman
 
Sure. In terms of the wealth business and the transaction line, as we stated 
the retail investor is still
 
somewhat on the sidelines. I think what changes 
that is the function of consumer confidence, whether that's acceleration of 
the GDP growth, whether that's rising rates, but I think we need to see some 
more confidence before the retail investor sort of tot
ally reengages, so that 
would be on the first question. On the second question on DOL, you did 
highlight that the, the comment period comes to a close tomorrow. As you 
know that is a complicated rule and the comment period was actually 
extended till tomorr
ow, because there's been a lot of industry dialogue and a 
lot written on it. FINRA Chairman, Richard Ketchem recently spoke about his 
idea of a single standard. So to have a single standard across all products 
and accounts and not treat anything differentl
y like a 401(k) or an IRA and 
we think that makes sense. Our clients clearly want choice, and we would 
support an approach that gives our ability to deliver that choice to our 
clients. So, we'll see where the final rule comes out.

nks a lot.

Bank. Please go ahead.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
Most of my questions have been answered, but I had a follow
-
up I think I 
asked it last quarter. The amount of long
-
term debt you have coming due 

billion. But what's the difference in the
 
long
-
term debt rate that's on the 
balance sheet versus what you get on new issuance? Obviously rates have 
come down. The two notch upgrade helps. How much revenue benefit or 
reduction in interest expense occurs as debt rolls off and you get to reissue 
at 
a lower rate?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So, a couple of things. One, you saw in the first half we did 
--
 
we issued 
about $23 billion, and we took advantage of some very attractive markets 
and we tried to frontload our issuance. So we would expect our issuance in 
the
 
back half of the year to be lower. In terms of the rate or the cost of that 
debt, I think one way I look at it is, if you think about the WAM of our debt 
stack in 2010 was about five years. So if I look back at 2010 to look where 
we were issuing debt at t
hat time, it was on an average of about Treasuries 
plus 210, so our credit spread is about 210 basis points over. That is a debt 
that is maturing today and our new issue 
--
 
our credit spreads today are 
closer to 120, so two plus 120. So we are clearly gett
ing a benefit as our 
more expensive debt roll off, recognize that that roll off is not our entire 
debt stack. We have over $155 billion of unsecured debt, and so that benefit 
will accrue over time, but that's sort of a magnitude for you.

particularly within the retail side of the loan growth in Wealth Management? 
Its been running about 40% annualized, is the

Matthew Burnell
 
Just in terms of your 
expectations for deposit growth now that the city 
transfers are done?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, as I mentioned we did see some seasonality for tax season in the 
deposit number this quarter. We still have significant excess liquidity that 

ying. I think Greg has mentioned some innovation 

think that will be ultimately a good driver for growth. But right now in terms 
of our deposit balances we have excess deposits that we 
can deploy without 

client base and grow those deposits with some new products going forward.

Okay. And then if I can just move over to the institutional loan port

faster than in

also growing. Can you

James Gorman
 
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
The second 
quarter was met with a mixed market backdrop. The quarter 
began on a strong footing, but macroeconomic and political uncertainties 
affected sentiment and conviction. Despite the sharp decline in interest rates 
and the slowdown in global growth, the busines
s model held up well. 
Collectively we produced revenues over $10 billion, and ROE of 11%, and an 
ROTCE of nearly 13%. Our year
-
to
-
date efficiency ratio of 71%, below the 
73% target, reflects our commitment to managing expenses tightly given 
the risk to glo
bal growth.
 
Despite the challenging environment, Institutional Securities' results were 
solid, with aggregate revenues over $5 billion. Our Equity Underwriting 
franchise performed well, and continued to bring new companies to markets. 
Issuers were opportun
istic and took advantage of fertile markets when 
available. In Advisory, M&A announcements picked up as the quarter 
progressed. We expect our equity franchise to remain number one globally, 
and fixed income results were at lower end of our expectations. We
alth 
Management produced record PBT and a margin of 28%, at the top end of 
the guidance range we gave through 2019. These results illustrate the 
resilience of the model. Higher asset levels and strong loan balance growth 
more than offset the effects of low
er interest rates.
 
Investment Management had very strong second quarter results. This 
business has meaningfully evolved since we reorganized it approximately 
four years ago, under Dan Simkowitz's leadership. While results do have the 
potential to be lumpy 
in this business, obviously, to put the growth in 
perspective, revenues over the last 12 months are up nearly $900 million 
since full
-
year 2016. Moreover, increased net long
-
term inflows should aid 
asset management fees going forward. We continue to invest
 
in the 
business, and looking forward to sharing more about Investment 
Management in the months ahead.
 
Turning briefly to the results of this year's CCAR exam, in late June, we 
announced that we will increase our quarterly dividend for the sixth 
consecutiv
e year to $0.35 a share a quarter, up from $0.30. We also intend 
to increase our repurchase of common stock from $4.7 billion to $6 billion. 
Collectively, this represents approximately 100% gross payout. In addition 
to increasing our return of capital to s
hareholders, we were able to invest in 
the business and completed the acquisition of Solium in the second quarter. 
We look forward to continuing to work with the Federal Reserve in returning 
high levels of capital in few tiers. All in all, we produced a so
lid quarter in a 
difficult environment, topped with a strong CCAR result.
 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the quarter in greater detail.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you, and good morning. In the second quarter, firm revenues were 
$10.2 billion
, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. PBT was $2.9 
billion, and EPS was $1.23. Returns were in line with our target ranges with 
an ROE of 11.2%, and an ROTCE of 12.8%. Given the global growth outlook 
is uncertain, we remain focused on expenses. T
otal non
-
interest expenses 
were $7.3 billion. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, total non
-
interest expenses 
declined 3%, and our expense efficiency ratio was 71%. Focus on our more 
controllable sources of spend, particularly marketing and business 
development and p
rofessional services continues to help self
-
fund our 
ongoing investments, including at the technology, workplace enhancements, 
and the integration of Solium.
 
Now, to the businesses, Institutional Securities generated revenues of $5.1 
billion in the second 
quarter, a 2% sequential decrease. Stronger 
performance in the Americas, particularly investment banking was offset by 
relative softness in Asia. Non
-
comp expenses were $1.9 billion for the 
quarter, a 4% increase from the prior quarter, and compensation ex
penses 
were $1.8 billion, resulting in a compensation to net revenue ratio of 35%. 
In Investment Banking, we generated revenues of $1.5 billion, up 28% 
sequentially, with advisory, equity, and debt underwriting all improving 
versus the first quarter. Despi
te lower completed M&A industry volumes, 
advisory revenues increased 25% quarter
-
over
-
quarter to $506 million. 
Underwriting results were resilient considering the mixed backdrop.
 
Equity underwriting was very strong, recovering from a challenging first 
quar
ter. Revenues were $546 million, up 61% sequentially. Equity volumes 
picked up across all regions. IPO issuance rebounded strongly as the U.S. 
market normalized following the government shutdown. We also witnessed a 
healthy pickup and follow
-
on activity. F
ixed income underwriting revenues 
increased 3% sequentially to $420 million despite lower industry issuance 
volumes in investment
-
grade bonds and leveraged loans. Overall advisory 
and underwriting pipelines remain healthy. CEOs remain engaged, focusing 
on 
potential M&A across the size [ph] spectrum as an investment for future 
growth. Geographically, while activity in the U.S. remained strong, M&A 
activity in the Asia
-
Pacific region is down notably compared to last year, 
driving in reduced cross border volum
e.
 
As we look ahead, macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical events can 
impact the conversion fro pipeline to realized, but for now the environment 
continues to support activity generally. In equity sales and trading, we 
retained our leadership position
 
and expect to be number one globally. 
Revenues were $2.1 billion, increasing 6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Across 
products activity peaked mid
-
quarter before subsiding in June. Prime 
brokerage revenues rose sequentially, consistent with the seasonal patterns 
i
n Europe. Client balances grew versus one quarter, and client conviction 
remains subdued.
 
Cash revenues improved quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by the Americas. And 
derivative revenues were essentially flat. Fixed incomes, sales and trading 
revenues were $1.1
 
billion in the second quarter. This represents a decline 
of 34% from a seasonally strong one quarter which had significant 
structured activity compared to a more challenging backdrop this quarter 
and limited structure activity revenues.
 
Macro revenues dec
lined sequentially. The sharp move lower in U.S. interest 
rates had a negative impacts on the rates business. Additionally, persistent 
low volatility dampened FX results. While credit complex results declined 
sequentially, they were strong by historical st
andards driven by securitized 
products performance. Credit trading businesses benefited from robust client 
activity and balance sheet velocity was maintained.
 
Commodity revenues declined quarter over quarter on lower trading results. 
Investments increased 
to $130 million sequentially driven by $106 million in 
realized gains associated with in investments, initial public offering, and 
subsequent mark
-
to
-
market gains on the remaining holdings subject to sale 
restrictions. We hold a series of strategic and bus
iness related investments 
around the world in various platforms and exchanges. And this is another 
example of our ability to monetize these investments.
 
Wealth management reported record revenues and pre
-
tax profits of $4.4 
billion and $1.2 billion respect
ively. The PBT margin was 28.2%, the highest 
margin post the acquisition. Asset management revenues were $2.5 million. 
Up 8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, benefiting from the improved asset levels we 
saw at the prior quarter's end. Transaction revenues were $728 m
illion. This 
represents an 11% decline from 1Q which included large gains in our 
deferred compensation plan investments.
 
Retail investors remained cautious given record market level, short intra
-
quarter market swings and heightened levels of uncertainty. T
ransactional 
activity remained subdued but has been consistent over the last several 
quarters. Total client assets ended the quarter at $2.6 trillion, up 4% higher 
versus the prior quarter. Net fee based assets was over $10 billion. Net 
interest income dec
lined to $1 billion. The sequential decline was largely 
driven by two factors. One, greater than expected deposit outflows due in 
part to tax payments resulting in a higher cost liability mix. And two, the 
divergence between LIBOR and Fed funds which impac
ted the spread on our 
variable rate loans.
 
On a year
-
to
-
date basis, net interest income is up 2%. And including the 
impacts of mortgage prepayments was better than our stated expectations 
of year
-
over
-
year mid single digit growth. Looking ahead, the shape 
of the 
forward curve and our deposit mix will continue to affect NII. We now expect 
NII ex
-
prepayments in the third quarter to be largely in line with the third 
quarter of 2018 with potentially a more material impact in the fourth quarter 
if the forward cu
rve is realized.
 
We continue to expect loan balances to grow by mid single digits for the full 
year. Loan balance growth in the quarter was healthy. Total bank lending 
ended the quarter at $74 billion, increasing $3 billion from 1Q on strong 
growth in SPLs
 
and continued progress in mortgages. Loans have grown 6% 
year
-
over
-
year reflecting deeper client engagement. Other revenues were 
$120 million, increasing 48% sequentially as a result of realized gains from 
our investment portfolio.
 
In the quarter, these g
ains largely offset the negative impact of prepayment, 
amortization on net interest income. Total expenses were essentially 
unchanged compared to the first quarter. Lower compensation expenses 
driven by movements in our deferred compensation plans were par
tially 
offset by seasonally higher non
-
compensation expenses as well as Solium 
expenses in the cost related to ongoing integration.
 
We closed the Solium acquisition on May 1st and have been pleased with the 
progress. We will be investing in our workplace o
ffering for the next 18 to 24 
months. This business is on very strong footing. And over the medium term, 
the margin will improve as revenues rise. Investment management produced 
very strong results. Revenues of $839 million were the highest for the 
segment
 
and over five years, improving 4% sequentially. This was primarily 
driven by strength in investments.
 
The business saw strong net flows, and we continue to see positive 
momentum in capital raising. Investment revenues of $247 million were 
driven by contin
ued strong performance across our private funds including in 
our private equity Asia, real estate, and infrastructure businesses. Total AUM 
of $497 billion increased 4% versus 1Q, with long
-
term AUM of $334 billion 
also increasing 4%. Market
-
related growth
 
and positive net flows across all 
of our asset classes drove the higher long
-
term AUM.
 
Asset management fees of $612 million were essentially flat to the first 
quarter. The higher management fees on the back of rising average AUM 
over the quarter were off
set by the seasonality of performance fees. As we 
have mentioned before, most of any year's performance fees will be 
recognized in the first and fourth quarters. Total expenses were up modestly 
to the first quarter on the back of higher revenues.
 
Turning t
o the balance sheet, total spot assets rose to $892 million as we 
continue to support our clients. Derivatives and lending activity within sales 
and trading also drove an increase in our RWAs, resulting in a decrease in 
our common equity Tier 1 ratio to 16
.3%. During the second quarter, we 
repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common stock or 26 million shares 
at $44.53, and the Board declared a $0.35 dividend per share. Our tax rate 
in the second quarter was 22.6%. We continue to expect our full
-
year t
ax 
rate will be similar to the 2018 tax rate excluding intermittent discrete 
items.
 
Looking ahead, Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy. Wealth 
Management's fee
-
based revenue should benefit from higher asset levels, 
and investment management remains
 
focused on growth and delivering 
increased value to clients. The third quarter is off to a strong start, but we 
are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown, and that conviction remains 
lackluster compared to this time last year. The uncertainties around 
global 
growth have risen, which may impact confidence and activity levels. That 
said, we remain committed to our strategic objectives, and expect to 
perform well if markets remain open and functioning.
 
With that, we will now open the line to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I would like to start, Jon, you 
walked 
through some of the deposit dynamics that impacted NII this 
quarter; that was helpful. Curious about what you're seeing since tax 
season, and your outlook for deposits, do you think that remix is effectively 
going to remain off balance sheet or do you thin
k there'll be some return of 
some of those lower cost deposits as we go forward from here?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. Let me try to give you a little bit more color, Brennan. In terms of the 
actual deposits, remember there are three buckets that sort of impact 
NII 
which is really the mix of deposits, the rate profile, and then obviously the 
balance. In terms of our deposits we saw about $10 billion of outflows in 
BDP, some from lager tax payments as we mentioned, some other just as 
people continue to look at the
ir cash as an investment vehicle and they've 
seen some higher yielding alternatives, but they are still pretty defensive. 
We did have lower rates that obviously impacted both yields and 
prepayments. And then lastly, we had increased balances, so that was a
 
positive.
 
The one thing that we would say on the deposit side that was positive is that 
the replacement of those $10 billion of deposits, although at a higher rate, 
were primarily driven from our wealth channel, so we had a lot of demand 
for our different
 
products as we continue to build out that product set. And 
so that continues to be a nice source to bring new money into the firm.
 
In terms of what happens going forward, I think that's a trickier question. 
We've seen post the tax payments, probably the l
ast five or six weeks of 
stabilization in those deposit levels, but again customer behavior, the 
forward curve, what happens to rates and the competitive dynamic will drive 
ultimately that outcome, but I think we feel very good about the deposit 
products t
hat we've been rolling out. We've been continuing to enhance our 
cash management products. We came out with a new high
-
yield savings 
product that had a lot of interest from the field, so again we should be able 
to source deposits pretty easily if that tren
d continues.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay, terrific. Thank you for all that color, that's really helpful. And then 
another question, you identified the trade web mark and tailwinds which was 
great to seek clarification on that. Another point that we had 
--
 
question
s we 
had heard from investors on the back of the results were around the mark in 
Investment Management that seemed strong again this quarter. Is that just 
primarily monetizations and we should think about as chunky? Was there 
anything unusual in that large
r revenue line this quarter? Thanks.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, I think chunky is the right word, but if you just think about the 
market environment, the monetization activity has picked up, and we've 
been selling it to strength across the private spectrum. An
d as I said, we 
saw nice gains in the Asia portfolios; we saw nice gains in real estate and 
infrastructure. It's just been a very good environment for monetizations, and 
we'll continue to take advantage of that environment. Another key driver is 
the flows.
 
We had positive net flows across all four categories, equity, fixed 
income, alternatives, and liquidity. The equity performance continues to be 
quiet good, and so we're very pleased with the shape and the position of 
that business.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our
 
next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. 
Your line is open.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Thank you. Good morning. Jon, can you share with us if the fed starts to cut 
deposit 
--
 
the fed fund rates there's an expectation that the deposit rates for 
the 
high net worth customers of some of your peers will start to fall. Have 
you guys modeled out how long after the fed actually starts to cut rates 
where you think you might be able to take your deposit rates down?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
We obviously run lots of dif
ferent scenarios and lots of different models. But 
I would tell that the guidance that I told you about what we think is going to 
happen to NII is based on the forward curve. And so the forward curve has 
sort of by July 30 basis points, but September I thi
nk around 50, and then 
almost three full cuts by the end of the year. So if the realized rates is 
different than the forward curve that will obviously impact performance. If 
it's slower that's positive for the rate component that I talked about, if it's 
fa
ster it's negative. So we obviously model all sorts of scenarios. We've used 
the 50% beta, give or take, for a while in our models, and that's what we 
continue to do. And what happens to actual betas will be, as I said, a 
function of really sort of the com
petitive environment, what alternative 
investments look like, and what not.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Okay. And then as a follow
-
up, obviously you guys had good growth on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis in your residential real estate portfolio within the 
Wealth Management di
vision. There's been some evidence that the high end 
housing market in New York City and other areas, the condo market, is 
really showing some signs of weakness. Have you 
--
 
and obviously many of 
your customers are high net worth customers. Can you share w
ith us just 
some of your underwriting standards of those types of mortgages, assuming 
you make them, and just how there should not be that much risk even if 
that market price comes down for those types of properties?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. Let me just take 
the two parts of that question separately. We've seen 
good growth in the mortgage portfolio, really has been a function around the 
changes we made in that platform. So we in
-
sourced and outsourced process 
last year, and we wanted to make sure, given that t
hese are our customers 
and they're high net worth customers, that we had the right service levels 
and the right attention to that project. And therefore we sort of gradually 
transitioned from outsource to in
-
source.
 
And then over the last year, as we've go
tten more mature in that process 
and our turn times have come down and our process has gotten better, 
we've been able to prosecute more applications, and that's really been the 
pickup. And sort of we slowed it down to make sure that we got it right, and 
no
w we're in a better position to fulfill our customer demand. In terms of the 
underwriting criteria, we haven't changed the underwriting criteria. It has a 
very strong FICO, a good LTV product. That product from an overall credit 
performance has been quite 
good. And we haven't seen any material 
changes in both the profile or the credit statistics.
 
James Gorman
 
I'd just add, Gerard, that that portfolio is based upon lending money to 
existing clients whose assets we hold here, so it's very different from a 
typ
ical mortgage portfolio at a bank. There are very high net worth people, 
we have their assets, we have their transactions, we know what their 
activity is. And as Jon said, their FICO scores are extremely high, the 
[indiscernible] is attractive. It historic
ally has not been an issue for the 
business.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of 
Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on capital and DFAST, it 
looks 
--
 
I don't know if you can give us your calculation on what the SEB is. 
And just I guess to bigger picture, given the size of the SEB potential is 
there any discussion with the fed or ability to kind of walk through why it 
seems like their model tend
s to punish you more than your peers. It seems 
pretty sizable relative to your more steady wealth management business. 
And just want to help understand or unpack the dynamic in the SEB for you 
guys.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Why don't I 
--
 
I'll try to kick off, and 
I'm sure James will have some 
comments. I think, first of all, just on the SEB, Vice Chairman Quarles has 
mentioned that this is a top priority of his, and he would like to implement it 
in 2020. So, I think it's still a little premature given that he said 
that last 
year, and we just don't really know what the new rules are. In a recent 
speech he's talked about transparency, simplicity, and volatility, so all good 
things when we think about it. So in terms of commenting specifically on an 
SEB, I think it's a
 
little premature to do that. If you look at the CCAR results, 
again in totality, we're at 100% payout ratio. We're increasing our buyback 
by 27%, and we have six consecutive years of 
--
 
or increases in our 
--
 
consecutive years in out dividend, so confirma
tion that we have strong 
capital level, so we're very pleased with that result.
 
In terms of their models and our models, clearly [technical difficulty 
00:02:18] you see from our DFAST data and their results that we still don't 
sync up as closely as we woul
d like. It looks like that they have given us a 
little bit more disclosure this year, but again, I think you highlight that it 
looks like they think that our costs could be a little sticker than we think 
they are. But again, we're engaged in those discussi
ons, and we'll continue 
to have those discussions going forward.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, I'd add to that, specifically the PPNR number is something that we're 
struggling to understand. The good news is this is the first time we have 
some transparency to it. It i
s not a function of a divergent view around our 
revenues, which is good. It apparently is a function of a divergent view on 
our non
-
interest expense. It's hard for us to understand how non
-
interest 
expense is sticky unless it relates to financial compensat
ion, which by 
definition is on a grid and is not sticky, but if one were to assume that you 
had to pay that notwithstanding the grid structure then clearly it would be 
sticky. That's an assumption that frankly has never borne out by history. 
We've never ha
d an instance where we've gone off grid. And I've been 
running these businesses for over 20 years, and I've never taken financial 
advisors off grid, nor has anybody else in the industry, to my knowledge.
 
So, this is something we are clearly highly engaged 
with. Again, good news, 
we have a little bit of transparency. The only sources of differential that I 
can plausibly figure out, which is several billions dollars over a year, and 
obviously two
-
and
-
a
-
half times of that or two
-
and
-
a
-
quarter times of that 
ove
r nine quarters is something relating to compensation expense, and 
probably operating losses that are still bleeding through on the time series, 
which we don't have full disclosure of, of how the Federal Reserve runs those 
operating losses. So in plain Eng
lish, we're still suffering from the deeds at 
this firm 10 years ago. And my attitude is we're a very, very different firm 
now.
 
We have very different risk profile. We have very different business mix. And 
yes, every year we get a year further away from th
at, the time series of it 
obviously becomes less important relating to those years, but it's still 
impacting losses. So again, critical topic, Jim, good question, and it's 
something I am personally very focused on, and I'm glad we're starting to 
get a litt
le bit under the kimono here, because this is 2019, not 2009. And 
this firm's capital base is extremely strong, as evidenced by CET1 ratio; it's 
one of the top couple of capital ratios in the world. And we need to get under 
this thing, and this is a multib
illion dollar movement. So materially affects us 
if we can unravel it, which I intend to do.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Right. Okay. Thank you very much. And then, maybe just as a follow
-
up, I 
think you talked about the pipeline being strong. I think we haven't seen 
muc
h of a pick
-
up in activity levels across particularly M&A, and it seems like 
outside the U.S. has been particularly weak given the overhangs, is your 
sense that the level of dialog though is pretty high and getting some clarity 
on the macro could help unle
ash some activity, or is it, are people still pretty 
big? I guess, again, particularly outside the U.S., is it still pretty hesitant, 
given the uncertainties?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, I mean, I make a couple of comments. Pipeline is very healthy. In 
terms of M
&A, you heard James; we have seen a pickup in some announced 
activity in the last four to six weeks. If you step back for a minute and you 
think about what's driving these transactions; clearly, growth, people looking 
to buy companies and improve their gro
wth profile. We've seen corporate 
clarifications, we've seen technology disruption, we've seen activism. So 
again, I think all of those things are still in play, and so, it's a healthy 
backdrop for M&A activity. We've seen a lot of activity in again, sort 
of 
technology driven, both in terms of the tech sector, but also what 
technology is doing is causing M&A activity, lots of activity in healthcare 
financial. So again, a very constructive backdrop, Asia is the one area, given 
the trade discussions and sort 
of China activity specifically it has been quite 
slow, but again, healthy pipeline, good backdrop, activity, feels good. It's 
taking a little bit longer than it normally does, so sort of a slowdown in the 
pull
-
through, but right now pretty constructive.
 
Op
erator
 
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu of 
Autonomous. Your line is open.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Good morning. Maybe another question on rate sensitivity, do rate cuts have 
any impact to the institutional business? I guess, I'm t
hinking more the 
prime brokerage business here or some of the more lending oriented parts 
effect?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, I mean, that's a great question, and that's one that we looked at 
constantly. So modeling NII, which is a small component of the overall 
revenue of the firm, it's pretty easy. We use the forward curve in the beta. 
And therefore we have sort of some perspective. But in terms of what it 
does to both our fixed income business and our equity business is really a 
function of how people interpret
 
the cut. If it increases some of the volatility 
and rates and there's more movement in rates generally volatility. That's not 
GAAP, it's helpful for the fixed income business, if it improves people's view 
of the world that there were going to extend the e
conomic expansion, and 
people want to press that view in the equity markets, it could obviously help 
in the PB activity levels, it could also lead to repositioning of portfolios, 
which we haven't really seen a lot of. So again, it's sort of really how peop
le 
interpret that cut. And I know everyone's always focused on NII, which for 
us is less relevant. But it really is going to be a function of what happens in 
those sales and trading businesses.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. Thank you. My second one, sort of bit of 
a nerdy accounting question 
here, but in the release, you kind of mentioned in other sales and trading, 
revenues increase due to a shift in funding mix and balance sheet 
composition, I also think in the Q. Last Q, you made some adjustments. I 
think that we
 
are looking to some of your deposit costs away from wealth 
management. So maybe just help us understand kind of what's going on 
with the funding strategy. How it's impacting different businesses and 
ultimately, the overall economic impact to the firm?
 
Jon
athan Pruzan
 
Okay. That was pretty nerdy accounting question. But let me just, as you 
know, there is a lot of things that go into both of the other sales and trading 
line and the other revenue line. And generally, the way I looked at those 
things are toget
her. So in the other sales and trading, we do a lot of hedging 
on our loan portfolios, we do economic hedging on our debt, we've got the 
DC excuse me Deferred Compensation plans. We have some liquidity 
attribution. In other revenues, we have some of those 
offsets, like the mark
-
to
-
market on our health for sale loans, as well as some of our MUFG JVs in 
there. So there are a lot of things that move around and we generally try to 
call out the larger ones each quarter. And so again, quarter
-
over
-
quarter, 
the ma
in changes in the sales and excuse me other sales and trading was 
really lower losses on hedges. On our loan portfolios, right w didn't see as 
much credit movement in credit spreads.
 
And then on the other revenue line, the mark
-
to
-
market gains on loans wer
e 
lower. So those things sort of moved in tandem. So there's lot of different 
things moving around, I think you have to look at those both together. I 
don't, I think I understand the question relative to what you asked about the 
Q. I don't think that that'
s what drove what the specifically what we saw this 
quarter, but hopefully, that's helpful.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells 
Fargo. Your line is now open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi, can you talk about the pre
-
tax profi
t margin in wealth management and 
the trade
-
off between optimizing that margin and investing for growth? I 
think that's an all
-
time high on a core basis. And I know we've talked before 
that James, you can always take it higher, but there's a trade
-
off betw
een 
investing for growth and making sure you have the revenues coming in over 
the next several years?
 
James Gorman
 
Where can I start with this? It's 
--
 
yes, it is an all
-
time high. It's actually 
slightly above the range that we put out of 26% to 28%. And I don't sort of 
jump around and start dancing, when we're a little a few basis points above 
a range and I'm not goin
g to be too distressed. If it's a few basis points into 
the range at any point this year. We're it's in a great position to imagine that 
business. We're still investing with that margin a lot in the business. It's not 
like we are sitting back saying, ""Boy,
 
we are really milking this or we're 
starving it?"" The team discussions we've had with Andy and Shelly and the 
whole field organization. I'm not suggesting that in any way, we're holding 
back on what they need to do to spend necessarily.
 
The reality is, Mi
ke, as you know, the incremental dollar revenue in that 
business comes on with a much higher margin than 28% today. I don't know 
exactly where it is, but it's clearly well into the 30s. So there's almost no 
way in which you can, if we are growing revenues,
 
you're not going to grow 
that margin in the business unless you have some sort of, operating issue, 
et cetera.
 
So, revenue growth, where incremental revenue is coming on higher than 
the existing margin, you could clearly see this margin go higher and we 
c
ould force it to go higher from where we are. We are choosing not to do 
that because we're playing for the long run. But I guess my short answer is, 
I think the business is in balance, I think we're investing as we should be. 
And I think the margin is just
 
the math. Revenue growth delivers the 
margin. I look at the Solium acquisition, we've got 
--
 
there's a bunch of 
investments we are making around that and also the integration costs. So 
that's something, which I guess is some sort drag on the mountain righ
t 
now, but and will be for the next couple of quarters. But I think that's a 
smart drag.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And then a follow
-
up but certainly the right environment takes a toll on NII, 
you've talked about that, can you remind us to the sensitivity of wealth 
manage
ment to higher stock prices. In other words, if the stock market 
stays at this higher level what impact would that have on the pre
-
tax margin 
in the third quarter?
 
James Gorman
 
Again, we would expect given where the market closed the prior quarter that 
ass
et management fees are going to go up in the third quarter. And again, 
that's a positive. We've seen positive momentum in that space, both in 
terms of flows as well as market appreciation. And so that should be a 
positive and that there's always gives and 
takes in the business. And 
obviously we talked about the NII on the other side.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of 
JMP Securities. Your line is open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question just on w
ealth management and 
customer engagement, the transaction activity has been muted even with 
markets at highs and that's normally not the case. And at the same time, 
we're seeing pretty healthy engagement at some of the e
-
brokers and I 
understand that's a d
ifferent client mix. But I'm just trying to potentially tie 
together the move that you're seeing the fee based advisor relationships 
with transactional activity slowing meeting that we're eventually going to be 
left with your brokerage relationships where 
the assets aren't turning over 
much and that's fine or is that maybe an overrated and there was a whole 
case for transactional activity.
 
James Gorman
 
Oh, yes. I think that's a good question and you probably have highlighted a 
lot of the drivers. I would ju
st say in terms of the sentiment, if you will. We 
are at all
-
time highs in some 
--
 
in the market levels, but I think as I 
mentioned earlier, there seems to be a lack of conviction around that in 
terms of both where is it going from here and given all the u
ncertainty 
around the rate profile as well as the growth profile, I think the retail 
investor is inundated with information every day.
 
We also saw a lot of volatility in the quarter which is generally, generally not 
good for the retail sentiment. And what 
we've seen in our portfolios is sort of 
a little bit of a defensive posture in the sense that there is a decent chunk of 
the investment assets in short dated fixed income securities more so than 
we've seen in the last couple of years. So they are pretty de
fensive today in 
terms of how they react to the economic environment, the core transactional 
volume is probably on a downward trend because of this shift from 
brokerage to fee based accounts. On the other hand obviously, there's a 
component of calendar so 
that will move around with the calendar and 
whether those markets are open and closed. But it's been pretty stable for 
the last several quarters and I think it's just really a function of what people 
think about outlook and stability. And we'll have to jus
t keep tracking it, but 
there is going to be pressure as we see more people go into these managed 
accounts.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Great, thanks. And just a follow
-
up on expenses, so you guys made the 
decision last fall to tighten expense management just heading into 
a more 
uncertain environment and that you managed, you mentioned just even last 
quarter that you're going to manage expenses tightly. So I'm just curious 
how you guys are feeling about the spending plan today relative to how the 
macro environment is develo
ping meaning is the business environment that 
we're seeing today developing in line with how things kind of you were 
looking out last fall and thinking about. So you're just staying on course or 
some of these newer uncertainties like on interest rates are 
they changing 
views or creating a catalyst to maybe look for other areas to tighten?
 
James Gorman
 
I think right now we're suddenly pleased. We got a little ahead of the 
expense thing, where you know we're pretty determined to run a tight ship 
through the e
nd of this year. There's no going to be no slack on that 
whether we turn the dials more, I'd say right now probably not. I think we're 
--
 
we've got a lot of expense initiatives going right now that we feel 
comfortable with. If you know things were material
ly to deteriorate on the 
revenue front for some reason, then we'll take action. I would point out this 
is we've had four quarters of $10 billion of revenue in our history and each 
of those have been in the last six quarters and we had a $9.8 billion quarte
r 
along the way there. So we've I'm conscious of the need obviously to be 
very disciplined and we put out I think a 73% target this quarter is a bit 
under 72% for expense efficiency ratios.
 
So that's definitely in line with what we wanted. At the same time
, we've got 
to invest and keep growing the business. We can't just manage it for the 
next three months. We've got to manage it for the next 5, 10 years. So it's 
that balance but we're definitely not taking our foot off expenses, I'm just 
not sure we're goi
ng to be pushing down harder unless we saw something 
materially shift. I think as John said, the pipeline outlook is good. The assets 
were priced at a nice level. Asset management is coming along nicely, we've 
started the quarter quite strongly, we're feel
ing so. I certainly don't think 
this is a time to panic, but we will be disciplined through the year. There's no 
question about that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of 
Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Hi, good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So James, I wanted to spend some time just digging into some of your 
earlier comments in terms of the pre
-
tax margin outlook. And I know on this 
call and in June you had cited your 
ability to really support high levels of 
investment and wealth as you noted and the higher incremental margins 
that each additional revenue dollar that's coming through all, what that 
supports in terms of improved profitability. I guess if I look back over
 
the 
last five to six years a lot of the pre
-
tax margin expansion has been 
facilitated by stronger growth and higher margin NII. And as we look to NII 
now becoming a headwind versus a tailwind, do you think beyond 2019 you 
can still hold the line on that 2
6% to 28% or does the pressure on the NII 
revenue source in particular impact your ability to really sustain that level of 
profitability?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, I mean you definitely pointed out the NII on the other hand, we've had 
DCP worked against us 
this quarter, we've had prepayments which have 
flushed out a bit. We've had very low transaction activity. I mean I think I'm 
surprised at how low the transaction activity has been notwithstanding the 
move to asset management product. I'd be more surprised
 
if it goes further 
down. I think we're sort of reaching a basic threshold where people are 
buying and selling different securities because the bonds maturing or 
whatever. So it's not what drives the numbers it's not just NII, we've had 
there are lot of mo
ving parts in here more money going to annuitize the 
accounts, the average velocity on those accounts, I think is about 20 basis 
points higher than the transaction accounts and that's for both fixed income 
and equity accounts.
 
So that's attractive. We just
 
priced the assets at a very high level at the 
beginning of this quarter. We've got more money going to in unitization. 
We're driving up the lending book. So yes, NII is clearly it's clearly a focus 
that's a huge focus for all the banks. It's not as import
ant to this institution 
but it's clearly important, it's clearly important for that business. But there 
are a lot of things going on under the cover Steve and I would say I'm 
confident about the target of 26% to 28%. This was a business that back in 
2006 w
hen we started the margins were 3% and people said we couldn't get 
to Unit 15 and then they said we couldn't get to 20, they said we couldn't 
get to 25. And it just clicks on in some quarters that you might bounce 
around by 50 basis points, backwards or fo
rwards. But the trajectory is 
pretty clear. And if you have decent asset prices, we continue to have the 
annuitize assets, we are originating more loans in the bank book, the NII is 
clearly not helpful but we can absorb some of that. So I've no reason to s
tep 
back from the target range that we've put out of 26% to 28%.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Thanks for the helpful color, James. And just maybe one follow
-
up for Jon, 
just on the NII guidance based on some of the investor feedback that we've 
gotten at least since Q&A k
icked off, there appears to be some confusion 
around the 3Q NII guide. I was wondering if you could give the dollar NII 
guidance for 3Q or at a minimum maybe quantify the impact from premium 
amortization that you expect in the upcoming quarter.
 
Jonathan Pr
uzan
 
The guidance that I gave was ex any sort of prepay. And I based it off third 
quarter of 2018 when there was no prepay impact and I said it would be 
more or less in line with third quarter 2018. So I think that's very clear. I'm 
sorry, it was confusing
 
in the jumble of all the other information I gave. So 
that is the guidance on the third quarter and as you know mortgage 
prepayments is going to be impacted by the rates in sort of the five to 10 
year shape of the curve and so I just gave you guidance ex
-
prepay if that 
those numbers go down dramatically, you'll see the prepayments hurt us 
and if they go up you'll see a reversal of the prepayment.
 
James Gorman
 
And I just the state obvious Steve because we've now had, I don't know six 
or seven callers in and
 
I think five or six talked had NII, we have some other 
businesses over here and some of those businesses chugging along quite 
nicely. The M&A pipeline we talked about the asset management business is 
doing really well, the annuitized assets. So again NII 
is important to us. It's 
not as important as it is to some of the other banks. Other things are also 
important to us, equity underwriting is extremely important to us. So I just 
-
-
 
I put it in that context, it's clearly a headwind but it's not like we don'
t 
have some other things going on under the hood here.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from 
KBW. Your line is open.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
Yes, thanks for taking my questions. First question on wealth management 
is a
 
fee based assets to total assets have plateaued kind of around 45%, 
over the last year could you just kind of give some color on why that's 
happened and is it still the desire to grow those fee based assets even above 
50% and beyond? Thanks.
 
Jonathan Pruz
an
 
Sure. And then we have plateaued a little bit. It's bounced around sort of 
43%, 44%, 45%. We do still believe that that number will go higher and 
could clearly go towards 50% and beyond. I do think that as we continue to 
refine our offering and sort of 
value based pricing that we'll continue to see 
more dollars flow into fee based accounts than to brokerage accounts. And 
right now it's just some of that's just really a function of whether the assets 
in each of those accounts are growing faster or slower 
because the 
composition of those two buckets are little bit different brokerage versus fee 
based, but we do still think that that number will increase over time.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
And then a separate question. You mentioned that you are selling AFS this 
qua
rter to offset the pre
-
pay amortization. Is that an ongoing strategy? Or is 
that just a one
-
off action this quarter?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, two things. It didn't fully offset the amortization. And two, it was not 
done for that reason. We look at our asset a
nd liability management all the 
time. And we took an opportunity to sell some securities and reinvest those 
securities in a different type of security that we thought had a better profile 
given that the rate outlook. So, again, it mostly offset the prepaym
ent, but 
not entirely.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank 
of America. Your line is open.
 
Sameer Murukutla
 
Hi, good morning. This is actually Sameer Murukutla on for Michael. Jon, you 
highlighted the number 
one position in equity trading. Yet, it seems a bit 
--
 
the results were a bit muted versus peers. Can you provide some details 
around what went on the quarter? Is this increased competition from more 
of your peers, or whether the results in the quarter is 
more about your 
[indiscernible]?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. And we are number one in that business globally. We have seen a 
turnover in market volumes slower. Cash and derivative muted clearly 
relative to the fourth quarter. If you look at year
-
to
-
date, the wall
et 
--
 
the 
size of the wallet is down. But again, I think our expectation is that we will 
maintain our market share in that business. And we will maintain our 
number one ranking. It's hard to look at these things quarter to quarter 
because sometimes people 
are comparing quarters to good quarters versus 
bad quarters or higher performance versus lower performance. But again, 
we are number one in this business. We have been for quite some time. We 
have got a very comprehensive offering. We are seeing good activ
ity level 
from our client base. Activity level lower than 80, but good engagement with 
our clients, and we are very comfortable with that business. And our 
expectation is to maintain share when markets contract, and that's what we 
are seeing.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of 
Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Thanks very much. Maybe just a quick follow
-
up on the equity front, I hear 
that you are number one in 
maintaining share, but in PB I think you 
mentioned something 
--
 
or actually ask the question of are client balances 
also muted just because market keep hitting high? I think of you guys as 
little over indexed to PB because you so far away the leader, but I
 
am 
curious if that could have something to do with any given quarter been off a 
little bit more than peers?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, again I think any given quarter is just a very short timeframe to look at, 
but I would say our PB business is obviously is ver
y healthy and very strong. 
What we have seen generally is the PB balances have drifted up. But there is 
not a lot of conviction around that. So as markets go up, balances go up. So 
the gross books have gone up. Leverage really hasn't gone up. Conviction 
ha
sn't really gone up. We haven't seen some historically if you were in this 
type of environment, you would see a lot of repositioning of portfolios. You 
would be seeing increasing leverage, and we just really haven't seen that 
although the balances continue
 
to go up with the market. So healthy, but 
again I think people are not as 
--
 
don't have as much conviction around 
these levels in this rally.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. Quick one on debt underwriting, it's been a good push. It's been good 
growth at Morgan Stanley
, but my view is it would be good lumpy tie to big 
M&A transactions. Is that the primary driver in the down 22 or so percent 
year
-
on
-
year just the piece is tied to large financings?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I mean 
--
 
well, we have clearly seen lower levels of 
leverage finance 
activity which is a higher margin business. We have seen a pickup actually in 
the last four or five weeks in that space, but our balances and our pipeline in 
that business for the first half of the year were clearly lower than where they 
w
ere last year. In investment grade, it's a little bit lower but still pretty 
healthy, but yes, sort of the chunkier, higher margin stuff is really going to 
be sort of the delta if you will in those numbers.

the third 
quarter were strong. Fee
-
based client assets and lending balances 
continue to build in wealth management, contributing to a 28% margin. 
Institutional Securities revenues were $5 billion with solid performance 
across all divisions, despite a mixed trading b
ackdrop and investment 
management, assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion as strong 
performance continues to attract positive long
-
term net flows. In aggregate, 
the firm produced an ROE and ROTCE of 11.2% and 12.9% for the quarter.
 
Before Jon take
s you through our results and answers your questions, let me 
share a couple of thoughts. The wealth management business is powerful. A 
$2.6 trillion of assets annualizing over $17 billion in revenues and margins at 
historic highs, the business is clearly s
tabilized in the firm. I am convinced 
there remain several meaningful avenues for growth. The biggest is we look 
to aggregate assets held away. Our core client segment should see 
significant asset growth over the next decade.
 
Further expansion of our servi
ces across the wealth spectrum from the 
highest end family offices to employees service through Morgan Stanley at 
Work provides us with the potential $4 trillion asset opportunity, also 
international opportunities, particularly Asia and continued growth of
 
our 
loan portfolios are among the exciting opportunities that remain in this 
business. But the most attractive part is every incremental dollar revenue is 
arriving at a high margin than the margin of the existing business. And while 
you may not see this e
xpansion over any individual quarter, over time, the 
business will grow and the margin will expand.
 
Our Institutional Securities business mix has proven to be very resilient. 
Against a relatively difficult trading environment characterized by some 
seasonal
ity and volatile markets, we performed well. This segment made $5 
billion in revenues and for the fifth time out of the last seven quarters, and it 
underscores the strength of our client franchise in all three lines of the 
business, investment banking, fix
ed income and equities.
 

this to continue as competitive dynamics evolve. Finally, our asset 
management business is well
-
positioned in the most attractive growth 
segments in the pub
lic and private markets with our leading active equity 
strategies and significant alternatives and solutions platforms. The growth in 
assets and profitability of the last few years are a testament to the refocus 
on this business. And as I said earlier, we 
passed $0.5 trillion in total assets 
with positive net long
-
term flows.
 
One ongoing challenge of our continued pursuit of higher ROE performance 

repositioned the firm to benefit from t
he more stable revenue streams.
 
To address capital which of course drives ROE, our current constraint is the 
leverage ratio. As the Federal Reserve adjusts the capital framework, we 
expect the focus will transition to CET1 which should benefit us in the 
ag
gregate.
 
Given global competitive dynamics, the strength of the brand, the stability of 
the institution, there is reason to believe, we can gain share in several of our 
businesses. The combination of growth, stability and potential for share 
gains leaves m
e with confidence that there remains tremendous upside here.
 
Overall, we remain cautious today as trade talks swirl and interest rate paths 
continue to be debated, but expect us to look beyond the next few months 
and focus on continuing to enhance the stab
ility of the franchise and growing 
the business. Our job is to continue to manage this institution for the long 
term.
 


eater detail. Jon?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you, James, and good morning.
 
In the third quarter, Firm revenues were $10 billion, representing the fifth 
quarter with revenues over $10 billion out of the last seven, and our highest 
third quarter in over a decade
. The 2% sequential revenue decline from the 
prior quarter is reflective of seasonal trends. PBT was $2.7 billion and EPS 
was $1.27, resulting in an ROE of 11.2% and an ROTCE of 12.9%. Year
-
to
-
date, ROE and ROTCE are 11.8% and 13.5%, respectively.
 
Total no
n
-
interest expenses were $7.3 billion in the third quarter. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, total non
-
interest expenses declined 1% and our efficiency 
ratio was 72%. As we continue to invest in technology, workplace 
enhancements and the integration of Solium, we 
remain focused on 
controlling more discretionary expenses, particularly marketing and business 
development and professional services.
 
Now to the businesses. Institutional Security revenues were strong, 
particularly in September. Despite a mixed market back
drop, revenues of $5 
billion were the highest for a third quarter excluding DVA in 10 years. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, increasing 5% 
sequentially on higher volume
-
related costs driven by increased client 
activity. Our com
pensation to net revenue ratio remained at 35%.
 
In the context of fluid markets including trade and political uncertainty, 
economic growth concerns and central bank responses, we remain focused 
on serving our clients, while actively managing our risk.
 
Inve
stment banking revenues were $1.5 billion, increasing 4% sequentially. 
The quarter
-
over
-
quarter increase was driven by improvement in fixed 
income underwriting and advisory, particularly in the Americas. Notably, 
fixed income underwriting produced record r
evenues as issuance activity 
accelerated. Advisory revenues increased 9% quarter
-
over
-
quarter to $550 
million. Completed M&A industry volumes increased supported by larger 
strategic transactions.
 
Underwriting results were robust. While equity underwriting 
saw a sequential 
decline, it was more than offset by the strength and share gains in our debt 
capital markets business. Equity underwriting revenues declined 27% to 
$401 million. Following a particularly strong second quarter, IPO issuance 
witnessed a nota
ble decline partially offset by convertible issuances. Fixed 
income underwriting increased 39% sequentially to $584 million on the 
strength across both investment grade and leveraged loan issuance. Activity 
was particularly strong in September. Issuers too
k advantage of the rate 
environment and the summer backlog of event
-
driven transactions was 
executed.
 
Overall, our pipelines remain healthy. CEOs are engaged and confident and 
strategic activity is supporting both our advisory and underwriting 
businesses. 
However, conversion from pipeline to realized remains highly 
dependent on market conditions.
 
In equity sales and trading, we retained our leadership position and expect 
to be number one globally. The quarter was strong with revenues of $2 
billion. The 7% s
equential decline was consistent with seasonal trends.
 
Prime brokerage revenues rose sequentially. Higher financing revenues 
supported by an increase in average client balances were partially offset by 
regional seasonality. Cash revenues saw a slight decli
ne versus the prior 
quarter on lower global volumes. However, revenues here were resilient as 
we have an increased share in a consolidating market. Volatile market 
conditions weighed on derivatives performance.
 
Fixed income sales and trading revenues incre
ased 26% sequentially to $1.4 
billion, driven by the strength in the credit complex. Micro results were 
robust across all major business lines, particularly securitized products. 
Activity levels were high and balance sheet velocity remains an area of focus
 
and has improved versus last year. While macro revenues increased 
sequentially, absolute performance was impacted by a challenging 
environment, particularly over the first half of the quarter. Sequential results 
benefited from increased client activity, i
ncluding structured transactions. 
Commodities revenues improved quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by North 
American Power and Gas. Investments declined $212 million sequentially.
 
The prior quarter benefited from realized gains associated with an 

 
and subsequent mark
-
to
-
market gains on remaining 
holdings which partially reversed in the third quarter.
 
Wealth management revenues and pretax profit were $4.4 billion and $1.2 
billion, respectively. The business produced a PBT margin of 28.4%, while 
cont
inuing to absorb expenses related to technology investments and the 
Solium integration. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, the PBT margin was 27.9%.
 
Asset management revenues were $2.6 billion, up 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, 
benefiting from the improved asset levels we
 

Total client assets ended the quarter at $2.6 trillion, in line with the prior 
quarter. Net fee
-
based flows were strong at $16 billion. Fee
-
based assets 
now comprise 46% of total client assets, up from 45%. We expect the 
secula
r increase in the allocation of assets towards advisory to continue.
 
Transactional revenues were $595 million, down 18% from the second 
quarter. Transactional activity remains subdued. Seasonally slower client 
activity, a weaker equity calendar and 
negative movements in our deferred 
compensation plan investments impacted results. Retail investors remain 
cautious given the continued uncertainty around the outlook.
 
Net interest income was $1 billion, up 3% sequentially. On a year
-
to
-
date 
basis, net int
erest income was unchanged. Excluding impacts of mortgage 
prepayment expense, NII year
-
to
-
date is up mid single digits. Loan growth 
was strong as balances are up 3% sequentially and 8% versus last year. We 
continue to see good receptivity of our lending pr
oducts and expect loan 
balances to continue to grow at a similar pace annually.
 
We saw stable BDP levels this quarter and continued success at raising 
deposits. Putting these NII components together, strong loan growth and 
more stable deposits will be more
 
than offset however by the current and 
expected rate path.
 
Total expenses were essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter, 
despite the integration of Solium. The impact of higher compensable 
revenues largely offset the movements related to our d
eferred compensation 
plans. Non
-
compensation expenses were effectively unchanged. Our target 
margin is 26% to 28%. This quarter, we pierced the high end of that range. 
As always, there could be movements quarter
-
over
-
quarter but full
-
year 
results will be s
olidly within our range.
 
Investment management produced revenues of $764 million. The business 
saw a strong and broad
-
based positive net flows and assets under 
management surpassed $0.5 trillion. The growth story for this business 
remains intact. Year
-
to
-
d
ate revenues are up 17% and the business is 
running nearly $1 billion more revenues versus 2016 levels. The investment 
environment remains constructive as investment revenues were $105 
million. As we have previously said, this line has the potential to be 
lumpy, 
though we continue to see the benefits of broad
-
based performance across 
our private funds.
 
Total AUM increased to $507 billion of which long
-
term AUM was $335 
billion. Positive net flows drove the higher AUM. Our equity strategies 
continue to deliv
er strong investment performance, driving net inflows. And 
we are beginning to see the benefits of the investments we have made into 
our fixed income platform with the second consecutive quarter of net 
inflows.
 
Asset management fees of $664 million increas
ed 8% sequentially. 
Performance fees were aided by a non
-
recurring realization in the quarter. 
Additionally, management fees benefited from rising average AUM.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets rose to $903 billion, driven 
by increased client
 
activity which also drove growth in RWAs. As a result, our 
common equity Tier 1 ratio declined to 16.2%.
 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.5 billion of 
common stock or 36 million shares at an average price of $41.92, and our 
Board 
declared a $0.35 dividend per share.
 
Our tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%, excluding $89 million of intermittent 
net discrete tax benefits. These discrete tax items added approximately 
$0.06 to EPS and 50 basis points to ROEs. We continue to expect our fu
ll
-
year tax rate will be in line with the 2018 tax rate, excluding intermittent 
discrete items.
 

quarter, but we are encouraged by client engagement and activity levels and 
are off to 
a good start. We are pleased with our competitive positions as the 
industries continue to see share consolidation and we are executing on our 
growth strategies.
 
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

You are certainly making progress over time with the ROTCE 13%, but

comp 
expenses were up 7%, comp was up a little bit. What sort of confidence do 
you have that revenues will grow faster than expenses, if not just for the 
quarter, but for the next year and how are you thinking about that 
relationship?
 
James Gorman
 


very good busi


bit. We had slightly high litigation this quarter relating to some stuff way 
back 10 years ago from the crisis, and s
ome of that just sort of makes its 
way through the pipes at different moment, so. And the BC [ph] was quite

Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. 
Your line is now open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking the 
questions. So, this quarter, we saw a 
pretty significant move by the discount brokers moving commissions to zero. 
Obviously, transactional revenue is easiest part to commoditize. But, there 
are some investors that are concerned that the next move that they
 
could 
make could be against advice. Do you consider that a threat? And, do you 
think that your recent tech investments have placed you well or there is still 
wood to chop on that front?
 
James Gorman
 

mething. Firstly, I 

surprised at the timing, frankly. I think, given the backdrop with where rates 
are, it was curious timing, but it is what it is. And as you point out Brennan, 
I th
ink,, the commission activity of buying and selling stocks and bonds in 
our wealth management business is a very small percentage of that 

than

the mid 70 basis points, Jon will correct me for advice on doll
ars of assets. 

clients are getting value. And when you put together the research, the trade 
execution, the financial planning, tying people in with their long
-
term 
charitable, givin
g their trust and estate planning, working with their 

implications are being wrong absolutely overwhelm a few basis points on the 
fees.
 
So, having high quality advisers giving high qu
ality advice is in my view a 
winning strategy. The real question is for what level of assets is it relevant. 

in the last 10 years has dropped precipitously. That is not an accident. Th

by design. We basically price that segment out of the core channel into the 


the financial adviser. But h
ouseholds with more than $10 million just with 
us, and bear in mind, those households tend to have two to three 
relationships like that have grown dramatically over the last decade. And 

1 

is. And in my view that is where the advice fee is very fair and very 
reasonable given the way you create it.

where the discoun

do you think this might impact that 
business? Do you think that might impact a little bit of the potential returns 
on that investment or was this part of the scenario planning that you guys

stock plan administration with financial education and tools for investing in 
savings is going over qui
te well. Additionally, we continue to convert our 

days, but the integration is going well.
 
And in terms of the economics and how we think about this business, it was 
really to g

companies with $1 billion

about it.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC 
Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
James, you touched on capital with the leverage ratio being your binding 
constraint. And you als
o indicated that, as the Fed adjusts its capital 
framework, it will shift to the CET1 ratio. When do you think that shift may 


d number that you 
think is more appropriate, once we move to the CET1 ratio?
 
James Gorman
 
Gerard, you are asking me to step into lion pit here. Listen, I think, the Fed 

happened with the 
regulatory framework. It was obviously critical to have 
the banks, recapitalize, raise their liquidity and build discipline around that. 
And I think the health of the U.S. banking system, if you look at the results 
of our peers in the last week, is clearly
 
reflective of that. I think, all of them 
are in dramatically better shape than they were 10 years ago, including 
Morgan Stanley.
 


 
at what is the intrinsic 
quality, and liquidity of the asset on the balance sheet does not make sense, 

treating those equal, and much more relevant to the business is where ou
r 
risk weighted assets lie. So, I think, this change which has been advertised 

own rule
-

this transition seems
 
to me to be sensible. And most people would agree 

much better sense of where the risk lies within the firms. That said, none of 
us want to get back to the pre
-
crisis leverage r
atio where banks were 
levered 30 to 60 times.
 

-
guess 


--
 


stay flat or go up. So, I start off that simple premise. Therefore there is only 
one alternative. How much change that delivers depends on what the S
CB 
buffer is and a bunch of other factors that would go into the new regime. So, 

will act accordingly as an institution.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Great. I appreciate your insights. And then
, Jon, you talked about on the 
equity trading that the cash revenues in the consolidating market helped 


bu
siness that way? And then, when you look at your cash equities relative to 
prime brokerage or derivatives, is that the largest contributor to the equity 
trading number?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

mies of 



is down a little bit


opportunity for us. In terms of the different businesses, obviously, prime 

 
sort of the center of the machine, if 


number one in the globe there for about the last five years. So, i

strong and powerful business. Between cash and derivatives, that will 
bounce around quarter

business is clearly the biggest.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with
 
Buckingham 
Research. Your line is now open.

Hey. Good morning. Maybe just talking a little bit about wealth management 
flows. I think, fee
-
based asset flows of $16 billion were pretty strong relative 
to what we saw at one of your competitors.
 
How much of that is being 
driven by just the shift from brokerage into fee
-
based versus just solid 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. We were pleased with the flows and we continue to 

very
-

secular trend of people wanting to convert their accounts into the fee
-
based 
format because of the services provided and the value proposition. So, it 
was a good 
mix of the different dynamics, new assets as well as flows from 

46%. That number has been creeping up; we expect it to continue to creep 
up over time here.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
And maybe just
 
a regulatory question, now that we have a final Volcker 


 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. Again, there is a final rule o
ut, but there is still some additional, 

not really

simplified it a little bit, but no real impact.

Thank
 
you. And our next question comes from Christian Bolu with 
Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Good morning. Maybe just on equities, and this one might be a bit of an 
unfair question, given the good job Ted and team have done in that
 

peers, it looks like it peaked at the end of 2017 and has basically steadily 
drifted down. So, curious kind of what

sort of the leverage con
straints, you alluded to an issue, and maybe

over the last year or two in sort of the 21% share type numbers. We do

shift from or a consolidation into the top two or three providers, most of that

You might also be referring to

European into the U.S. banks in some of the prime brokerage balances and 
other parts of the equities business. A

Jonathan Pruzan
 



provide the
 

with our technology around four places, advice; service; relationship 
management; and asset acquisition. On the asset acquisition side, I would 
say the best or the most impactful technol
ogy we have is really around both 
asset aggregation and our risk analytics. It allows us to do stress scenarios 

-
based on different scenarios and 
look at concentrations. And once we have a much better picture of all
 
our 



enhanced our digi

we think all of that leads to a better ability to attract those assets.
 
The other last point I would make is, those assets in the high wealth or the 
high net worth bucket are actually 

only the incremental assets they have outside of the firm, but their assets 
inside of the firm, and their wealth are growing quite quickly.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
And are you still periodically doing specials, if you will, on
 
cash management 
products to bring over assets in a low rate environment? Do you still have 
room to reduce wholesale funding and bring in some more deposits?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe 
Research. Your line is now open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So, I wanted to start with a question on the capital strategy. And James, 

pit. But, ahead of the SCB implementation, the big sticki
ng point with many 
investors is the higher CET1 burden, which at 16% is 250 bps above your 
next peer. That gap translates into roughly a 200 basis
-
point drag on your 

spent many an
 
occasion talking about the shortcomings in the models. We 
looked at prior transcripts, I think, going back as far as 2014 publicly. But 




alternative actions you can take to potentially reduce that capital burden?
 
James Gorman
 
Steve, I think, you want to give the Fed a little bit of credit here. I mea
n, 
there actually has been progress. Just the change in the rules around 
--
 
and 

rules around which banks are designated as systemically important, the 
change in the qualitative tes
t and taking away that sort of qualitative hurdle 
and just relying on annual supervisory letters, the changes that have taken 
place in the Volcker Rule, more transparency that came through the last 
CCAR proposal, the openness of the Fed to consider, not co
unting buybacks 
and dividends against capital basis, and the potential removal of the 

movement towards the SCB structure. And when we see how all of this plays 
out, and as I s
aid earlier, I forget who asked the question, I think it was 
Gerard, how we feel this playing out, we will then 
--
 



ey are staying flat.
 


the expense structure within the models where as I said on the last call, we 
find quit

would suggest our expenses would do in the time of systemic stress. And 

time this year, we have some transparency as to
 
where the source of that 
difference is, which enables us to dig in on it.
 
There is a different openness for 10 years into this for addressing some of 

on the supervisory side from
 


critical to the health of the economy. Having banks properly capitalized and 
not overcapitalized is the essential for them to gr
ow their balance sheets and 
provide lending capability to businesses and individuals.
 



and see that. We have shown a willingness to adjust our 
business model over time. And I think the build out of the wealth 
management which is 
--
 
was clearly part of that strategy, build out of asset 
management of strategy and the stabilizing revenues withi
n the institutional

Devin Ryan
 

lower, how should we think about, I guess, the comp ratio in wealth 
management, all els
e equal, just given kind of the positive comp dynamics 
that creates?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I think, as we mentioned in my script, compensable revenues has ticked 
up a little bit as a percentage. And so that will impact the comp ratio. But,

discip
lined, obviously across the platform, specifically in wealth 

but the mix is important.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay. Thanks, Jon. And then, I guess, the follow
-
up here just within 
investment ba
nking. So, you mentioned in the script that backlogs are 
healthy. It does seem that the equity underwriting backlog has been strong 
but some of that keeps getting pushed forward. And then, the M&A outlook 
still 
--
 
it seems constructive. But, as we move clo


maybe if you can just talk a bit more about the tone within the various 
investment banking businesses right now and anything else you can add 
around kind of 
the near

term and intermediate

term outlook as we move 
into 2020?
 
James Gorman
 


discussion 
--
 
CEOs are obviously co
ncerned about the direction of the trade 
talks and that this stays within sort of guardrails of reasonableness. Nobody 
wants to see a global economic slowdown. On the other hand, financing is 
cheap, people remain confident about the U.S. economy, and trans
actions 
are getting done. And, I think the backlog has been healthy. The advisory 
number was strong. As you pointed out, some of the ECM numbers with 
some of the deals that came to market of the last several months and things 
that got pulled. That has put 
a little bit of a dampener on that. On the other 
hand, we made a major push with our DCM business, and I think you saw 
the results. I think, our share was around 14% this year 
--
 
this quarter, 

there is still a 
sense where despite all the naysaying and all the news and all the pundits, 
the reality is the U.S. economy is in good shape and the consumer balance 
sheets are in good shape. People are continuing to spend the 
--
 
earnings 
coming out of th
e last week or so demonstrated very solid performance 

disagree on that.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. No, I would agree. And I think, as James mentioned, CEOs still feel 
pretty good 



that, because the markets are constructive.
 
M&A market continues to be 

a very healthy M&A market and there is a potential to do that again next 
year. The lot of the ingredients behind M&A around the search for growth 
and
 


the market. But right now, the healthy 
--
 
pipelines are healthy and the 
market is constructive.

T
hank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of 
America. Your line is now open.
 
Mike Carrier
 
James, you mentioned upfront some of the market share opportunities that 
you still see. You provided some color on the $4 trillion in wealth 
manag
ement. I guess, just on the institutional securities, you guys have 
done well over time. But, what initiatives are in place now to increase share, 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

ort of highlighted our growth strategies. 



to
 
see opportunities in Asia, we continue to see opportunities within 
investment banking to consolidate share, and as I mentioned, in equities we 
continue to see more share go to the top providers who offer a differentiated 
service. So, we feel good about th

gained probably 3 or 4 points in share in all of the ISG business combined in 
the last several years. We like the momentum. And assuming the market 
stays constructive, we believe we continue to build share across all thre
e 
segments.
 
Mike Carrier
 
And just a quick follow
-
up on the last question. Just on confidence in activity 
levels, you mentioned trade. If on the Brexit side we get some follow
-
through here, on the news this morning. How much is that weighed on 
activity, par
ticularly in Europe versus the trade issues?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

softness there, not dramatic. It would be nice to get something resolved. 

ty. So, hopefully this deal will 
get approved and will get executed, and that will be taken off the table. I 
think, though the European results were probably more impacted just about 

n 
Brexit per se.

James Gorman
 
Thank you, Kathleen. Good 
morning, and apologies for my winter cold. I 
wanted to start off just by saying, obviously after a relatively strong first half 
the third quarter was obviously disappointing. It reflected a difficult market 
environment throughout the quarter.
 
Before we dis
cuss some of the things that are behind these numbers and 
that drove this result, let me touch on a few of the positive aspects of the 
last three months.
 
Our M&A franchise remained strong this quarter, benefiting from a robust 
deal environment. While much 
of the underwriting calendar was deferred 
from the third quarter, we expect the business to take place in the fourth 
quarter and early 2016.
 
Equities once again finished number one in the US this quarter, and we 
expect to be number one once all global peer
s have reported over the 
coming weeks. After a strong first half, the business held together in a 
challenging environment across regions and products, including cash, 
derivatives and prime brokerage. We expect this trend to continue.
 
Our wealth management 
franchise was impacted by a lack of new issue 
product and a general retail investor step back from markets, given 
volatility. While we do not expect this to be a long
-
term trend, we remain 
focused on expenses in the meantime.
 
Our year
-
over
-
year earnings im
proved, in spite of lower revenues and we 
generated a 23% margin, which is consistent with our stated goals.
 
Turning now to the challenges, of which there are three to note, and of 
which Jon will take you through in more detail in a moment. First, and 
obvi
ously fixed income underperformed in the quarter, largely due to a very 
challenging market environment, in which we were significantly impacted 
given our business mix, particularly our focus on credit and rates.
 
Second, most of the investment management bu
siness performed solidly, 
but the aggregate results significantly underperformed. This was driven 
largely by a reversal of carry in our Asia private equity business, a business 
which historically has been a strong contributor for over a decade.
 
And third, 
we also had $320 million in legal expenses in the quarter, an 
increase of $250 million from last year, driven largely by the settlement of 
the CDS litigation.
 
We remain focused on resolving outstanding legal issues and have made 
significant progress to dat
e. Notwithstanding the challenges of the quarter, 
our core long
-
term strategy remains in place, namely, a balanced business 
model in which the consistency of wealth management offsets potential 
volatility in institutional securities.
 
The team is highly foc
used on those levers within our control that enable us 
to manage the business in a way that reflects the environment we are in, 
and whatever the environment we may face in the future. This includes a 
continued focus on expenses.
 
We recently made significan
t management changes in two businesses to 
better leverage our business model. Ted Pick, who has managed equities to 
the number one position on the Street has become Global Head of Sales and 
Trading.
 
Having institutional equities, fixed incomes and research
 
under Ted will allow 
us to leverage our infrastructure while continuing to make sensible 
investments in the ongoing electronification of both our equities and fixed 
income franchises.
 
Dan Simkowitz has become Head of Investment Management, which 
includes 
Merchant Banking, real estate investing, and traditional asset 
management. Dan will report to me and work to broaden our platform and 
products, while leveraging distribution channels that we have in place. 
Investment management is an important business for
 
Morgan Stanley for 
the future and deserves our intense focus. Finally, our capital funding and 
liquidity positions remain robust.
 
With that, Jon will take you through the quarter in more detail, then we will 
open up for questions to both of us. Thank you 
very much.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. I will review our quarterly 
financial performance and business results, and then James and I will be 
happy to take your questions.
 
Before I discuss the individual businesses, I will first
 
make a few comments 
on our overall performance. The quarter was very challenging. In contrast to 
the first half, the third quarter backdrop was less constructive.
 
Besides the normal summer seasonality, the quarter was characterized by 
global equity market
s trending lower, volatility metrics increasing, spreads 
widening, policy uncertainty and periodic bouts of risk aversion.
 
Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.8 billion in the third quarter or $7.3 
billion excluding DVA, down 20% versus second quarter 
'15, or 23% 
excluding DVA. Our expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion, down 10% 
versus $7 billion in 2Q '15. Compensation expense was $3.4 billion, down 
22% versus $4.4 billion last quarter, driven by lower revenues.
 
Non
-
compensation expenses were $2.9
 
billion, up 9% versus $2.6 billion in 
2Q '15, driven by an increase in litigation reserves, which included an 
increase related to the settlement of the credit default swap antitrust 
litigation matter.
 
Our effective tax rate of approximately 29% was lower 
than last quarter, 
driven by our geographic mix of earnings. ROE for the third quarter was 
5.6% or 3.9% ex
-
DVA.
 
Now to the businesses. Our institutional securities franchise had a difficult 
third quarter, with revenues of $3.9 billion or $3.5 billion exclu
ding DVA, 
down 25% and 30% respectively versus second quarter of 2015.
 
We saw underperformance in fixed income, driven by relative mix of our 
business, primarily by lower revenue in credit and securitized products in a 
challenging credit market, in additio
n to lower activity and rates given 
investor uncertainty on said action.
 
More broadly in our sales and trading and capital market businesses, we 
were impacted by seasonality and lower than typical levels of activity in 
September. However, we 
continued to demonstrate strength in several key 
franchises.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues were strong, as clients remained engaged 
across regions and products, and in advisory, we had our best quarter in 
several years, as M&A volumes remain strong.
 
No
n
-
interest expense was down 9% versus the second quarter. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 15%, driven 
primarily by increased litigation reserve, I mentioned previously.
 
Compensation expenses were $1.3 billion, down 31% quart
er
-
over
-
quarter. 
Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was held flat at the first half rate 
of 38%.
 
In investment banking, we saw strong performance in our M&A business 
offset by weakness in the debt and equity underwriting markets, resulting in 
invest
ment banking revenues of $1.2 billion, down 18% sequentially.
 
As of September 30, Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global IPOs, 
number two in global announced M&A and number three in global equity. In 
advisory, we benefited from a continuation of a robu
st M&A market.
 
We saw strength in cross border M&A and large cap transactions and acted 
as M&A advisor on several of the quarter's most significant transactions. We 
acted as sole financial advisor to Cigna on their merger with Anthem in the 
transaction val
ued at $54 billion in cash and stock. The combined company 
will be the leading health insurer in the US.
 
Morgan Stanley also acted as sole financial advisor to ACE on their 
acquisition of Chubb for $28 billion in cash and stock. Advisory revenues for 
the q
uarter were $557 million, 32% higher than the second quarter.
 
The M&A pipeline remains strong, up both year
-
over
-
year and sequentially. 
We have seen a strong start to deal activity in the fourth quarter, and board 
room engagement and dialogue remains high.
 
Turning to underwriting. Our underwriting business slowed significantly, as 
the typical pick up in September deal activity was delayed due to uncertain 
markets. We had a significant number of deals delayed in September.
 
For the market, equity underwriting
 
volume was down 55%, IPO 
underwriting volume was down 72%, and debt underwriting volume was 
down 23% versus last quarter.
 
Underwriting revenues were $624 million this quarter, down 39% versus last 
quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $250 million, d
own 49% versus 
second quarter, primarily reflecting declines across all products, particularly 
for IPOs and follow
-
ons.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues were down 29% versus the second 
quarter driven by decreases in both investment grade and non
-
investme
nt 
grade loan and bond underwriting.
 
Notable underwriting transactions in the quarter includes in equity, Morgan 
Stanley acted as joint underwriter and joint lead manager on a $3.6 billion 
rights offering for Commonwealth Bank of Australia. We also acted a
s a joint 
global coordinator, lead left book writer and stabilization agent for Citizens 
Financial Group in their $2.6 billion follow
-
on offering.
 
In capital markets, we see a strong pipeline building for future quarters, as 
clients await a more stable mar
ket. As volatility abates, we would expect to 
see a pickup in activity.
 
In the first 12 days of the quarter, we have begun to see many of the 
delayed deals from September's price. However, the sustainability of this 
activity will be predicated on the marke
t backdrop.
 
Coming off of two strong quarters, equity sales and trading again was solid, 
against a backdrop of significantly more volatility. The business remained 
number one in the US, and we believe we continue to be number one 
globally, driven by our fo
cus on clients and execution, which has led us to 
our leadership position.
 
Ex
-
DVA, revenues of $1.8 billion in the quarter were down 22% sequentially, 
but essentially flat year
-
over
-
year, as clients remained active and engaged.
 
Cash equity revenues were do
wn versus the second quarter and year
-
over
-
year, driven by a more challenging environment, including a lighter primary 
calendar and periods of risk aversion.
 
Prime brokerage revenues remained solid, although down from a very strong 
second quarter, which is
 
seasonally high related to European dividend 
activities. Revenues were up year
-
over
-
year due to increased client 
engagement.
 
Derivative revenues were down quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven by lower 
corporate derivative activity, but remained strong and were up
 
year
-
over
-
year. Year
-
to
-
date, we have delivered strong performance in equities, with 
revenues, excluding DVA, up 19% year over year. Despite very different 
market backdrops, we have been able to serve our clients' needs while 
prudently managing risk.
 
In f
ixed income and commodities, we saw a very challenging market 
environment. We were particularly impacted by spread widening in credit 
and mortgages and lower levels of client activity and rates throughout the 
quarter.
 
For the quarter, fixed income and comm
odity sales and trading revenue 
were $583 million, excluding DVA, down 54% versus the second quarter.
 
Revenues and credit and securitized products were hardest hit and were 
down significantly quarter
-
over
-
quarter due to difficult market conditions.
 
Rates r
evenues in the quarter were down sequentially, driven by significant 
policy uncertainty, that led to sporadic client activity and engagement.
 
FX results were up modestly versus second quarter as increased volatility led 
to continued client engagement. Over
 
time, FX has been a much smaller 
relative business for us.
 
Commodities results were up modestly quarter
-
over
-
quarter, and our risk
-
weighted assets, X lending, ended the quarter at $158 billion, essentially flat 
to second quarter.
 
The fourth quarter end sa
les and trading is typically seasonally weakest. So 
far in the quarter some of the key drivers that will likely drive client activity 
are mixed. Drivers of near
-
term uncertainty, including the Fed, China, 
commodities and global growth, have not diminished.
 
However, we have seen a modest rebound in global markets and reduction 
in some volatility indices, including the VIX.
 
Investment revenues were up quarter
-
over
-
quarter and year
-
over
-
year, 
driven by gains on business
-
related investments. Other 
revenues were down 
versus last quarter, driven primarily by markdowns on our relationship and 
event books. Lastly, average trading VAR for the second quarter was $53 
million, stable versus last quarter. Although we saw increases in volatility, it 
was offse
t by a reduction in risk.
 
Turning to wealth management, our wealth management business provided 
stability in the quarter, even in a turbulent and declining global market. 
While revenues were down 6% for the quarter, largely driven by lower 
marks in our def
erred compensation plans, we maintained a 23% margin. 
Our bank strategy continued to play out, as we had previously discussed.
 
Over the past few years, our daily revenues are a good indication of the 
stability and consistency of our wealth management busin
ess and they have 
consistently been between $50 million and $70 million, with no day year
-
to
-
date below this range.
 
Asset management revenues were flat from last quarter with higher 
revenues from fee
-
based accounts, partially offset by lower mutual fund 
ac
tivity.
 
Global fee
-
based asset inflows were $7.7 billion in the quarter, continuing 
the trend we see toward client demand for managed accounts. Total fee
-
based client assets were $770 billion at quarter end, representing 40% of 
client assets. The assets ar
e down quarter
-
over
-
quarter, reflecting the 
market decline of the third quarter.
 
We saw continued softness in transactional revenues, which were down 25% 
compared to the last quarter. This was primarily driven by lower marks in 
our deferred compensation pl
ans, as well as lower new issue activity, 
consistent with a slower equity underwriting calendar, which impacted ISG.
 
Transactional revenues were also impacted by subdued levels of retail 
investor activity, driven by ongoing uncertainty and global volatilit
y.
 
Our deposit deployment strategy continues to yield results. Net interest 
income revenue increased 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven by steady, 
prudent growth in lending, consistent with the continued execution of our US 
bank strategy.
 
Funded lending balan
ces in wealth management grew approximately $3 
billion during the quarter and $12 billion year
-
over
-
year. In the mortgage 
business, average FICO scores continue to be greater than 750, with 
weighted average LTVs of less than 65%. And securities
-
based lendi
ng 
remains highly over collateralized and continued to perform well despite the 
quarter's volatility.
 
Non
-
interest expenses were $2.8 billion, down 6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, 
showing continued expense discipline in this business. Compensation 
expenses was $2
 
billion, down 8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven by lower 
marks on deferred compensation plans, and lower FA compensation, as a 
result of lower compensable revenues. Non
-
compensation expense was flat 
sequentially.
 
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $1
39 billion, up $7 billion versus 
the second quarter, as clients moved into cash and a volatile market. This is 
another indicator of subdued retail activity. But we would expect clients to 
redeploy this cash over time.
 
Wealth management representatives were
 
up slightly versus the second 
quarter on lower attrition. This business not only provides stability and 
consistency, but also growth. PBT for the first nine months of 2015 is up 
14% over the same period in 2014.
 
In investment management, the quarter was d
ifficult, for Asia valuations in 
particular in China and monetization events, which resulted in revenues of 
$274 million, down 64% sequentially.
 
The vast majority of the sequential declines in revenue could be attributed to 
the reversal of previously
-
accru
ed carried interest in our Asia private equity 
business and no material gains in our other funds versus last quarter.
 
We have a strong history in Asia private equity and in particular, China. This 
quarter however, we had to reverse more than two
-
thirds of 
the carry that 
our Asia private equity funds had accrued.
 
This reversal accounted for virtually all of the loss reported on the 
investments line in the investment management segment. The ultimate 
realization of carry in these funds will be based on investm
ent performance 
over the next several years.
 
In traditional asset management, revenues for the quarter were $389 
million, down 10% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. The focus in this business 
continues to be on product innovation, distribution and growth.
 
For example,
 
this quarter, we transferred certain portfolio managers and 
their portfolios from wealth management to investment management to 
better align our capabilities with client demand.
 
This move allows the portfolio management teams to distribute their 
strategie
s in multiple vehicles across a broader and fully integrated 
distribution channel, while also enhancing the product mix available to our 
investment management clients.
 
Non
-
interest expenses were $312 million, down 41%, driven primarily by a 
reduction in co
mpensation expense versus last quarter, due to a decrease in 
deferred compensation associated with carried interest. Total assets under 
management ended the quarter at approximately $404 billion.
 
Turning to the balance sheet and capital, total assets were 
$834 billion at 
September 30, up from $826 billion at the end of the second quarter. 
However, average balance sheet for the quarter was $828 billion, down from 
$848 billion in the second quarter.
 
Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $
191 billion 
compared with $188 billion at the end of the second quarter.
 
Now onto capital, reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve 
rules, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio base, using the Basel III 
fully phased
-
in advanced approach
 
was 12.4% at September 30.
 
Pro forma fully phased
-
in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be 
approximately $434 billion, up from $427 billion in the second quarter. We 
estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the US final rule 
to be ap
proximately 5.5% at September 30, up from 5.3% at the end of the 
second quarter. All of these estimates are preliminary, and subject to 
revisions.
 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock, or 
approximately 17 million shares, an
d our Board declared a $0.15 dividend 
per share.
 
With that, we will open up the line to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy 
Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go 
ahead.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning. First a question on equities. It is, as you pointed out, flat 
year
-
over
-
year, and industry leading. But your peers were all up mostly 
double
-
digits or very high single digits year
-
over
-
year.
 
I guess the question is, we k
now that some of the strength year
-
to
-
date, 
especially for firms with a strong prime brokerage franchise, has been from 
repricing of some of the more scarce resources down feed driven activities.
 
I guess the question is, for you, has some of that pricing b
enefit lapsed or 
anniversaried, or are what we actually seeing is that underlying all of that, 
maybe you had more significant weakness in cash equities, like because of 
blocks or something?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So Guy, I guess there were a couple different ques
tions in there. I think in 
terms of our equities performance, as we said, we continued to maintain our 
leadership position and we are number one. Quarter
-
over
-
quarter all of the 
products were down. We obviously had a very strong first half.
 
PB was down due
 
to some lack of the dividend seasonality that we see third 
quarter versus second quarter, but as you said, up year
-
over
-
year, 
derivatives were lower quarter over quarter, on less corporate derivative 
activity, but was up year
-
over
-
year.
 
So the weakness ye
ar
-
over
-
year was really in the cash products, where we 
saw, obviously, a much more challenging market environment, sporadic 
bouts of risk aversion, as well as slower 

 
excuse me, primary calendar.
 
The other point I would make is that the third quarter of '
14 for us in 
equities was a very strong quarter, driven really by a very strong primary 
calendar. So it was a tough comp from that perspective, but again, 
essentially flat year
-
over
-
year.
 
And then lastly, I think on the repricing question, I would answer b
y saying 
that we've been focused on the returns to the prime brokerage business, 
and we've done that in partnership with our clients and looking at the 
relationship holistically across the nine boxes that we've discussed before.
 
We've done this through a c
ombination of better business mix, optimization 
and wider pricing, and we've seen the revenue per balance sheet usage 
increase over the last year. So the prime brokerage business has been and 
will continue to be a strong business for us, and it's been real
ly a business 
that the client engagement has led to good results.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
I guess just to hone in on that last part a little bit, were a lot of the pricing 
changes that you were able to put through in the third quarter a year ago 
and therefore are w
e beginning to see kind of an anniversary effect of the 
benefit that you get from that pricing?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I wouldn't necessarily describe it like that. We've been continually trying to 
optimize the return we get on our assets. And I would say it's be
en an 
evolutionary process, and we will continue to work with our clients to deliver 
good products and a good relationship.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Okay. Thanks. And then moving on to asset management, the decline in the 
additional [ph] revenues away from the merch
ant banking and real estate 
issues that we were talking about, the decline in revenue there is about I 
think 17% year
-
over
-
year, and yet your assets under management our flat. 
Do we attribute that decline to a lack of performance fees relative to a year 
ag
o?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'm sorry, in the traditional asset management business?
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
If you look at the traditional line that you break out, the revenue in the third 
quarter is down 17% year
-
over
-
year. but the assets under management look 
like they a
re unchanged.
 
And so I'm just wondering, what's driving that decline in the revenue. Is it 
performance fees that were not present in the current quarter or is there 
something else?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No, I mean, I think it's more driven by mix. As you know, i
n that business 
we have a narrow product set in our equity businesses. We also are only in 
active products, so 
-
 
and we've seen, as you can see from that chart, an 
increase in our liquidity product, where we've also seen decreases in certain 
of our equity 
products. As you see from the disclosure, we have an emerging 
market fund that saw significant outflows this quarter.
 
The other point that I would make is that it's related somewhat to the 
markdowns on the deferred compensation plans that we've talked abou
t in 
the past, and that was also a driver to that decline.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Got it. And just a broad question on fixed. Given the results that you saw in 
the quarter, and I'm conscious of the mix difference that you talk about 
between yourselves and many 
of your peers.
 
But does the sharp decline and the magnitude of the revenue at this point 
spark any incremental thinking as to size and structure that's appropriate for 
the unit or the risk management that's appropriate for the unit?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen,
 
as we discussed in both James' and my comments, this was a very 
different market that we saw in the first quarter. I think the volatility, the 
lack of conviction, the policy uncertainty, coupled with really no macro 
themes or events that investors embrace
.
 
So it was a very difficult market. It was not particularly conducive for our 
relative business mix, as you mentioned. But keep in mind that we've 
reshaped and resized this business based on the market opportunity that we 
think exists.
 
We brought down our
 
RWAs in this business by over $200 billion. We've 
brought down our balance sheet. We've brought down our non
-
comp 
expenses. We've brought down our headcount. We've sold several 
commodities businesses and we closed another one and we've also 
revamped our d
istribution strategy.
 
We've resized this business, while maintaining a presence across products 
and geographies. And we continue to optimize this business in the face of 
challenges, both for the industry and the business.
 
We've seen cyclical, secular, stru
ctural, and regulatory changes in this 
business and many of these have led to announcements, particularly out of 
Europe, of people rethinking their overall strategies, and we do think that 
this market dislocation can create opportunity for us.
 
But we're fo
cused on what we can control to drive improved performance. 
We've done a lot of work in this business, and we will continue to try to drive 
performance.
 
James Gorman
 
I'll just add a couple of things to what Jon said, Guy. Firstly, if you look at 
the perfor
mance of fixed this year, you've seen three very different quarters. 
First quarter being $4 billion revenues, second quarter being $1 billion, 
obviously this quarter a little under $600 million, very different macro 
environments, very different performance
. This one, the least favorable 
environment to the particular business, we have obviously.
 
As Jon said, this has been a multi
-
year journey. We have dramatically 
reduced RWAs in this business and restructured it. I think combining the 
fixed income business 
with equities under the leadership of Mr. Pick here will 
prevent opportunities for further synergies with those businesses, which I 
would expect. And we continue to watch this space very carefully.
 
We're by no means complacent about this, and but at the sa
me time, there 
are elements of our fixed income business which are essential to everything 
else that we do in investment banking with our wealth management and so 
on.
 
So it's a continuing focus of us, but I'm not taking everything from one 
single quarter. 
On the other hand, we want to make sure that if this isn't a 
long
-
term trend, than clearly we'll take whatever steps we need to take.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you so much.
 
James Gorman
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from
 
the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. 
Please go ahead.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thanks. Just one follow
-
up on the FICC conversation. Because I agree 
with you Jon, that all the stuff that you've done have been an improvement 
in terms of reshaping and resizin
g.
 
But the results are the results, and I don't want to focus on any one given 
quarter. Let's look year
-
to
-
date, let's look at the last five years, it doesn't 
matter.
 
FICC is still having a hard time becoming, I guess, a fully functioning 
business, such th
at, in any given quarter if credit is bad, you're overweight 
credit.
 
So I guess, back to the same question, you moved it under Ted's supervision 
for a reason. What are you hoping that he can bring. Because he obviously 
did a great job in equities, but what
 
are the things that transfer, what are 
the synergies that can come out of there, because I'm assuming the moves 
happened for a reason?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, Glenn, let me deal with that. Firstly, I think let's give Ted a little time 
in the saddle here, to co
me back to you, and I'm not going to speak for him 
right now. We'll give him a little time to get his arms around the business 
with the management team there, which they will do, and I'm sure in the 
New Year, we'll be saying a lot more about it.
 
But you ha
ve to see our fixed income business in the context of everything 
else we have at Morgan Stanley. It is obviously a significantly smaller 
business for us than equities or wealth management.
 
And frankly, has been smaller than investment banking over the 
last couple 
of years. So that's sort of the size of it, relative to what we are doing as an 
institution is an important factor here.
 
The idiosyncratic aspect of credit for this quarter is obviously important. 
Clearly, if foreign exchange was a weak quarter
, then that would affect the 
Universal Banks differently from the way it would affect us. So I'm not going 
to get too caught up in one quarter's performance.
 
We understand the issues with fixed income. We are not alone in 
understanding those. I don't think
 
there is a day that you don't read in the 
newspaper about one of the large banks thinking through the new fixed 
income market.
 
What it means in this very low rate environment, and what the outlook is 
and given the regulatory changes, how much balance shee
t and what sort of 
risk weighted assets you can hold in the business.
 
As Jon said, we've made frankly very aggressive moves over three years, 
bringing the RWAs down from $390 billion
-
plus to $150 billion
-
plus today. 
We think bringing it together with equit
ies and having one sales and trading 
business is the most efficient and effective way to serve our clients and we'll 
come back over time with whatever changes that might imply.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. We'll move on. Just one other, in Asia private equity, I won
dered, it 
was helpful, you said over two
-
thirds of the accrued performance fees were 
reversed out. I don't know if you want to share what's the dollar amount 
that's left, just so people could see the downside. But the reality is I just 
want to make sure, t
he Asian markets are up already in October.
 
So does it swing as quickly on the other way if markets hold the year? Would 
we see a turnaround in the investment line, and maybe you could size the 
amount of funds in the Asian private equity business?
 
Jonathan
 
Pruzan
 
So I think you picked up on one important point. I did say it's about two
-
thirds of the carry from Asia private equity. I also mentioned that virtually all 
of the investment line in the IM segment would be driven by that reversal. 
So hopefully that
 
can give you a rough size.
 
I'm not going to comment on where that carry will go, going forward. It's 
obviously going to be based on the investment performance and the 
valuations in the market. As James said, we have a long history in Asia. We 
have a stron
g team. That's been a good business for us.
 
We're on Asia PE Fund Four, so we've had four separate funds in that 
market. The first two are effectively finished and delivered strong returns to 
investors. Fund three, even after the reversal of carry and the 
performance 
this quarter is above, its preferred return hurdle, and fund four is really in 
the investment period, but that is also above book value.
 
So this has been a strong business for us historically, just had a tough 
quarter. And again, carry going fo
rward is going to be a function of 
investments and valuation.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go 
ahead.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi. I just want to try on that last question again. So what was your
 
write
-
down on Asia private equity this quarter, since it's so large compared to 
other quarters? It would be helpful to have that number?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
What I would say, Mike, is if you look at that line in our supplement there in 
terms of the investment
, it was negative $235 million this quarter versus a 
positive $232 million in the second quarter.
 
The two drivers of that is one, virtually all of that negative number can be 
attributed to the reversal of carry from our Asia PE business, and two, in the 
se
cond quarter, we saw significant monetization events across the entire 
fund complex and we didn't see any material monetization events in this 
quarter. So that's how I would try to size that for you.
 
Mike Mayo
 
As it relates to FICC, your RWAs are close to 
$150 billion. They are down a 
lot over the last few years. But I thought you said that might start to 
increase. And there was also a late June Wall Street Journal article that said 
that Morgan Stanley would weigh more of a comeback in fixed income. So 
the 
bigger picture question is, what does Morgan Stanley want to be in 
FICC?
 
On the one hand, you have the strategy of UBS, which really has retreated 
and built the franchise around their wealth management business, and that's 
really paying off. And I know a l

Stanley to go the route of UBS. On the other hand, you have some large US 
banks that still want to be the dominant fixed income players.
 
So which is it, because we're seeing some press reports, some RWA 
forecasts that
 
imply that you're getting big. And at the same time we see 
these articles we have, I think it's the worst core FICC quarter since the 
financial crisis. So if you could provide some more color, that would be 
helpful?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, you're right about t
he last thing, I think it probably is the worst core 
FICC since the financial crisis, Mike. And secondly, I think what we said was, 
if we saw opportunity as some of the non
-
core assets rolled off, I think there 
was about $20 billion if memory serves me, th
at we would be open to 
utilizing those.
 
But we certainly weren't expanding from where we are now. So it's more 
replacement cost or replacement opportunity, if you will, and we're obviously 
not seeing that opportunity right now. So don't fret too much 
about that.
 
On the newspaper article, again if memory serves me, that was something 
which I found a little bizarre. Actually related to the expansion of the 
mortgage business that we are doing in wealth management, which has 
been a phenomenal business, as 
we take relatively affluent people who have 
money with us and we re
-
lend them the money back, because they don't 
want to create a liquidity event in their portfolio.
 
And that has been a business with FICO scores I think about 750. Loan to 
values less than 
65%, thereabouts and almost zero, I think we've had one 
credit loss out of over 20,000 individual loans.
 
So a pretty spectacular business. For some reason the journalists wrote that 
headline, that expanding retail mortgage is somehow implied we're 
expandin
g mortgage trading in fixed income, and it did not.
 
We corrected it and they said they understood, but the press had written a 
story. So don't worry about that. That was completely separate from what 
we're trying to do.
 
So the story remains as is. Listen, 
we have radically restructured our fixed 
income business from what it was. Clearly, this quarter it did not perform 
anywhere near where we want and expect and need it to.
 
The first quarter was very different. The second quarter was about halfway 
between th
e two. And watch this space, we're not complacent, but on the 
other hand, we don't have a knee
-
jerk reaction based upon a 13 week 
period, and a very unusual 13 week period at that.
 
But on the other hand, we're focused on driving up returns to Morgan 
Stanle
y. We've been focused on that for many years. We are seeing the 
results of it on the Wealth Management side.
 
We had clearly an unusual hiccup in the merchant bank this quarter, which is 
highly unlikely to repeat itself. And the core banking and equities bu
sinesses 
continued doing what they were doing. So not sure I can add a whole lot 
more to it.
 
Mike Mayo
 
How much do you have in the non
-
core assets left in FICC?
 
James Gorman
 
I don't think we've broken down the total amount. Jon?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I thin
k, listen. As we said, I think in the beginning of the year, that we 
had through passive mitigation some level, about $25 billion of assets that 
would run off over time. As James said, we never committed one way or 
another what we would do with that passiv
e roll off.
 
We look at our balance sheet and our businesses holistically. If there are 
return opportunities across the platform, whether that be equities, fixed 
income, wealth, we will put those assets to work. But those are basically the 
sizing of that nu
mber, Mike.
 
James Gorman
 
And I can promise you one thing. If we do not see opportunity, we will not 
keep those assets in
-
house. We will not keep the balance sheet in the 
position it is.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And last question, James, or just a comment. You said a goal
 
for Morgan 
Stanley is to show better consistency and this quarter did not show that 
consistency. So how should investors think about this quarter in the context 
of your goal?
 
James Gorman
 
I hope that they would think it in the context of 23 quarters that 
this 
management team has presided over. It was a very unusual macro 
environment. The volatility in China was almost historic.
 
July was, we're still dealing with will Greece, won't Greece. September was 
will she, won't she, which was Yellen, and in the midd
le was China, which 
went up and down in a six month period at an extraordinary rate, with 
artificial intervention by the CSRC and other things that really threw the 
markets sideways.
 
So I'd like to think that investors would see those things for what they 
were, 
and focus on the core business strategy for what it is. We delivered 23% 
margin on lower revenues in wealth management, which is exactly what we 
said we would do in strategy.
 
We had over $500 million in fees in M&A, which is exactly in our wheelhouse
 
of strategy. And we will have, I think when all fully report, the number one 
equities franchise on the globe, which is exactly what we said we would do in 
our strategy.
 
So I'm not making excuses from it. We said right at the outset this was a 
difficult en
vironment, but a disappointing quarter and it was. And we hold 
ourselves accountable for that, and we will drive performance as a result of 
that.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America
-
Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Hi, thanks a lot. Jonathan, just on the wealth management business, if we 
look at the transaction revenues not just for the quarter, but even year
-
to
-
date, looks like they've been weaker. And I don't 
know if that's a transition 
of certain accounts into sort of the fee side or if it's just environmental
 
But I also just wanted to understand, like how significant 
-
 
you mentioned 
the deferred comp component, how significant is that for that line item?
 
Jona
than Pruzan
 
For that line item specifically, if you look quarter
-
over
-
quarter, I think the 
revenues were down 6%. If you back at the deferred comp impact in both 
quarters, it would be low single digits. So stable, pretty stable revenues.
 
The mix as we've t
alked about in the past is continuation of growth in the 
NII line, continued year
-
over
-
year growth in the managed account line and 
then some softness in the transactional revenues.
 
We've seen the volatility in markets and one of the description of the thir
d 
quarter James left out in August, we saw a 1,000 point drop in the Dow one 
day. That was not really constructive for our retail engagement numbers.
 
So there's been a lot of volatility. It's been a softer calendar, and as you 
said, there's been a shift in
to some of these managed accounts as well. So 
all of those are factors.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow
-
up on the merchant banking 
business, I mean, not really on the Asia fund. But when we look at that 
business and 
maybe the overall portfolio, I just want to get a sense on the 
mix of the assets that are in there.
 
And then it sounds like on the Asia fund, you didn't go under the high 
watermark or the hurdle. So it was just a negative environment. And so you 
take the h
it and you get the negative carry.
 
But going forward, if the investments are positive, there's nothing that we 
should be thinking about differently, meaning, if it's positive, we'll see the 
positive carry return.
 
But really want to understand the mix of th
at business, because when we're 
in more volatile environments, we can see some quarters where some weird 
things happen. So any color you could provide there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. So a couple of things. In terms of 
-
 
I think in the supplement, we 
break out
 
where the assets under management are. We have a broad 
private equity and merchant banking real estate investment business. So 
you can see the different strategies and the different dollars of assets under 
management.
 
In terms of your comment about revers
al of carry or then I guess, the 
restatement of carry going forward, there is 
-
 
these funds are structured like 
traditional private equity funds, and there is a phase where you accrue and 
carry, where there is a catch
-
up phase that accelerates the accrual 
of carry, 
when you go above the preferred return hurdle.
 
You then 
-
 
when the carry reverses itself, you have the inverse of that. We 
saw that in a second half of 2013, where we had the just sort of breaking 
through that preferred return hurdle, where we ha
d the acceleration, and 
this was the inverse of that.
 
And specifically to your last question, we are, on fund three, we are still 
above our preferred return. So there is still some carry that has been 
accrued in that fund.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay. All right. 
Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please 
go ahead.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Thanks. Good morning. Jon, quick follow
-
up on that question on wealth 
management from Mike with the deferred comp. Can you give us wha
t your 
margin would be if we backed out the deferred comp noise in the wealth 
management business?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I don't have that number.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
But it would probably be a little bit lower than what you reported, right, 
because it's going to 
lower your comp by a similar amount as your revenue?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, it's clearly neutral to the bottom line, and this is a line item that sort of 
has been running through quarter
-
to
-
quarter. So I don't know what the 
margin would be without it. But i
t's definitely neutral to the bottom line.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. But it is right just in thinking about it, that it's going to move 
expenses by the same amount, its right?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. Yes, neutral to the bottom line.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Got it. Okay. Th
anks for that. And then tax rates have been kind of volatile 
this year. I know it's tricky, but is there any way we should think about the 
full year here this year on taxes?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. The tax rate has been volatile. We've said in the past it's a
 
function of 
the geographic mix of earnings. I think we steered you towards 32% last 
quarter. For the full year, right, there is an adjustment period as the 
geographic mix, there is the actual mix of earnings based on legal entity 
versus a managed business
, as well as sort of a look forward of what we 
think that mix is going to look like.
 
So it is a volatile number, but I would say 32% effective tax rate for the 
entire year is still what we would say, plus or minus.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. Thank you. And then 
lastly on wealth management, you guys saw 
deposits grow this quarter, was there anything specific driving that?
 
And then when we think about the loan to deposit ratio, as you guys 
continue to show nice growth in the loan book. How should we frame loan 
grow
th, and where the loan book can get to, based on that?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So two questions, I think on the bank deposit program. I did highlight that 
we saw an increase in $7 billion and that was really based on the volatility in 
the markets and we saw that i
nvestors either stayed or moved into cash, 
relative to those volatile markets. And as I said, we would expect over time 
as that volatility abates and their confidence returns, that will be reinvested 
in the market.
 
In terms of the loan growth, we have seen
 
good progress against our 
deposit deployment plan. We still have excess liquidity to deploy. We see a 
healthy and diversified pipeline. And we continue to expect to grow the loans 
in the bank. It's primarily going to be driven by wealth management.
 
It's g
oing to be primarily driven by the mortgage product and the SBL 
product. And as I said, quarter
-
over
-
quarter, we were up $3 billion and 
year
-
over
-
year up $12 billion.
 
So we still see a healthy pipeline. I would say the penetration rates in terms 
of FAs eng
aging with their clients on these products are still high, and we 
would expect the growth to continue.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. And then, thinking about wealth management and the potential new 
rule on the Department of Labor's fiduciary proposal. How much of y
our 
wealth management client assets are in retirement accounts, and what 
percentage of those are advisory?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So we don't break that out, and obviously the fiduciary duty standard has 
gotten a lot of attention, and there's been a lot of indust
ry dialogue around 
it. I think the comment period was extended, and we saw that there were 
over 300,000 comment letters on this proposal.
 
We like to provide our clients with choice. We're hoping that the final rules 
allow us to do that, and we'll wait for 
those final rules to come out.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. But not anything that you can size for us?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, we will wait for the final rules to come out, and then we'll come back 
to you.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. Last one, just on FICC, sorry to 
sort of beat this a little bit here. But 
as 

 
sort of has been alluded to, equities and wealth management has 
seemed to have gone well and this is the one business that has continued to 
draw attention.
 
And James, I think there's a quote in the press releas
e for you about 
addressing areas of underperformance. That seems clearly tied to FICC. Is 
that the right inference? And then does the timing of Ted getting in charge 
of the FICC business now to tie into this weak quarter and does it also circle 
back to pre
vious comments that you all have made as being 2015 a really 
important year for FICC to prove that they can generate good enough 
results?
 
James Gorman
 
A lot of questions in there, Brennan. I think we've probably said all we want 
to say about FICC. It was o
ne quarter, it was a disappointing quarter. The 
timing of the organization announcement was not related to this quarter.
 
The timing of the organization announcement is related to our desire to 
bring ourselves and trading businesses together, make them as e
fficient and 
effective as we can.
 
We're all working very hard on that. Ted, Collum, myself, Michael Heaney 
and Rob Rooney in fixed income and all of their team. Listen, I think we've 
said what we've wanted to say about this quarter. It is what it is and we
 
move forward. We're not here asleep at the wheel.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Fair enough. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. 
Please go ahead.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Hey, thanks. Good morning. We talked quite a 
bit about margin targets in 
GWM. But looking at ISG, it seems to be some pretty big margin tailwinds 
just from the bank growth and optimization there and then lower funding 
costs.
 
Just taking a step back from the challenges of this quarter, how should we 
t
hink about incremental margin potential in ISG, particularly as you benefit 
from some of these revenue tailwinds.
 
I'm trying to think through how much of that benefit will flow to the bottom 
line versus being reinvested back into other parts of ISG?
 
Jonath
an Pruzan
 
So on the ISG side, we are clearly focused on expenses and trying to be 
disciplined there. As I mentioned, the comp ratio at 38% is below our stated 
target from the beginning of the year.
 
On the non
-
comp side, we obviously have the increase in th
e litigation 
reserve this quarter. We've also highlighted for you last quarter, called out 
some professional fees related to the regulatory agenda.
 
Our hope is that today, when we look back, that we're sort of 
-
 
we have 
accomplished more of the regulatory 
agenda behind us than we have in front 
of us. But we still have a large regulatory agenda and trying to figure out 
went those costs abate, is really challenging.
 
We are very focused on expenses. We're trying to control those expenses 
that we can control, a
nd we will continue to do that going forward.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay. And then just within ISG additionally, lending exposure to energy. Can 
you quantify that, and then any other counterparty exposures related to 
energy would be helpful?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
In terms 
of energy exposure, we do have an institutional lending business, 
which includes exposure to energy. I would say that our energy exposure 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter hasn't changed materially. Most of the energy lending is 
to large, multinational corporations and a
bout two thirds of that lending 
exposure is to investment grade counterparties.
 
E&P, which is been a big focus of the market, that exposure for us is a much 
smaller portion of our overall exposure. And approximately half of that 
-
 
of 
our E&P exposure is se
cured, excuse me, by reserves.
 
Like others, we have seen some deterioration in credit in that portfolio, but 
we haven't taken any significant losses there. As with all our exposures, we 
are managing them very tightly. And when appropriate, we are also hedg
ing 
those exposures.
 
I would say, given that environment, we would expect continued pressure in 
this area. But we are focused on it, and we are managing it tightly.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of 
Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please 
go ahead.
 
Fiona Swaffield
 
Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. One was on the wealth 
management net interest income, where in the previous couple of quarters, 
certainly Q2 you mentioned the realization of the forward cur
ve and your 
investment securities proposal has been a factor.
 
I don't know if you could talk us through Q3, Q2 in that respect, within the 
wealth management net interest income.
 
And the second area was on the supplementary leverage exposure, the SLR, 
and t
he total exposure number. It seems to have gone down. I mean, is 
there some 
-
 
have you been successful on reducing add
-
ons or I think in the 
past, you talked about securities financing. I just wonder if you could talk a 
bit about that strategy? Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'll take the second one first. In terms of the SLR, that's an average 
calculation and as I said, we saw average assets decline over the quarter. 
And we continue to make progress on the balance sheet add
-
ons. So I would 
say it's a combinati
on of a reduction in average assets, as well as some good 
work around compression and other things on the add
-
ons.
 
The first question around the forward curve, I think what we've said 
historically is that the growth in NII is primarily driven off of our de
posit 
deployment strategy and taking our excess liquidity out of available for sale 
securities and putting them into the loan products.
 
That will be primary driver going forward. Clearly, the forward curve is 
helpful, as we reinvest our available for sale 
securities portfolio. I think since 
we talked last time, I think we probably in an environment of lower, longer 
-
 
and lower and longer.
 
So that will have an impact. But again, our NII growth has been primarily 
driven by the loan growth.
 
Fiona Swaffield
 
Can
 
I just follow
-
up, so if I look to Q3, Q2, there wouldn't have been a 
negative from AFS or anything like that, it just may have been less positive 
than in the past couple of quarters?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
That's probably a reasonable characterization.
 
Fiona Swa
ffield
 
Okay. Thanks very much.

Your final question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. 
Please go ahead.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Good morning, Jon. Good morning, James.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Morning.
 
Christian Bolu
 
On 
the relationship lending losses, can you give some more color on what 
drove that? Was it mostly energy related or more broad
-
based?
 
And then just any comments you have, how you feel in terms of your credit 
metrics of the book would be helpful also?
 
Jonatha
n Pruzan
 
As I did highlight, we did have markdowns on our held for sale relationship 
and event loans, as a result of the market environment. I wouldn't call out 
any individual or specific sector or event.
 
However, I would also highlight that the bottom lin
e impact was minimal, as 
we hedge many of our fair value loans as appropriate.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on wealth management, quick 
question. FA count ticked up this quarter. Curious if that's just trainees or 
are you 
start to see a better environment for advisor recruitment?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I would say it's a little bit of lower attrition and a little bit on the trainee 
side.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. Thank you.

James Gorman
 
Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the second 
quarter, we 
achieved 9% ROE reflecting the stability of many of our 
businesses, which offset a relatively difficult trading environment. In many 
ways, this quarter provided a robust test of our business strategy. Whilst 
many trading businesses are affected by benign m
arkets, characterized by 
low volatility and the absence of meaningful macro events, other business 
lines demonstrative resilience.
 
Investment banking showed continued strength, reflecting diversity of our 
global M&A and capital markets franchises. Investme
nt management, saw 
asset inflows and solid performance across alternatives. As a result, this 
business saw improved revenues and returns.
 
Wealth management performed at the high end of our 2017 target, 
achieving 25% pre
-
tax margin and a record profit befor
e tax of over $1 
billion. It is worth noting that in the first year after the acquisition of Smith 
Barney, wealth management generated approximately $1 billion to pre
-
tax 
profit annually.
 
Compensation expenses are in line with our stated targets and higher
 
accruals year
-
to
-
date reflect higher revenues. Non
-
compensation expenses, 
include one notable item, which Jon will take you through in a moment.
 

respectable return to shareholders, a
lbeit at the bottom
-
end of our target 
range. Of course with the firm now on solid footing, [performance] (Ph) 
could still materially improve in the years ahead assuming constructive 
markets.
 
In addition, there are three tailwinds worth calling out, each of
 
which has the 
potential to impact our long
-
term performance in a material and positive 
way, capital, tax reform and interest rates.
 
On capital, this year through CCAR, we asked for and received approval to 
buyback up to $5 million of stock and increase ou
r dividend to an aggregate 
of $1 per share annually. While we intend to invest in our business as 

capital to continue to reduce our share count.
 
Much has been told through adjustments as 
some of the Doug Frank rules 
that were put in place over the past eight years. It is fair to say that now is 
the time to make some practical changes for the multitude of regulations. 
These changes would allow U.S. banks to be greater engines of economic 
gr
owth.
 
Second, U.S. corporate taxes are too high. If the administration in Congress 
can achieve a sensible realignment of tax rates with other major developed 
economies, then that would be a clear positive for our business and 
corporate America in general.
 
Finally, as the major U.S. depository we have endured historically low 
interest rates for a very long time. Each move when hiring rates assuming a 
measured path should benefit our business. In summary, in the second 
quarter we showed resilient in a challen
ging market. In a more favorable 
environment, we should see better results.
 
More interesting to us though, of a long
-
term impact as some of the changes 

while we remain cautious in t
he near
-
term, we launch our business mix and 
remain bullish on the long
-
term outlook for the firm.
 
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter in greater detail. 
Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you and good morning. The optimism that char
acterized the first 
quarter was replaced with a more subdued tone amongst clients for the 
majority of the second quarter. Activity was more sporadic in market 
sensitive businesses particularly within fixed income were impacted. That 
said, we supported our 
clients when market opportunities presented 
themselves.
 
Equity sales and trading and investment banking produced strong results. 
Wealth management and investment management both witnessed continued 
growth and stabilized our headline performance. Firm reven
ues were $9.5 
billion, down 2% compared to a strong Q1. PBT was $2.6 billion, EPS was 
$0.87 and ROE was 9.1.
 
Non
-
compensation expenses were up approximately $138 million or 65 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Well over half of the increase was due to a provision 
that
 
we recorded as a result of a self identified item relating to that on inter
-
company services provided to our UK operation.
 
We also saw some seasonal increase in professional services, marketing and 
business development and higher volume driven expenses. W
e continue to 
exercise compensation expense discipline, which led to a 1% sequential 
decline in total non
-
interest expense.
 
On project streamline, virtually all identified projects are in flight and we are 
on
-
track to complete the target outlined at the st
art of last year. Compared 
to the same period in 2016, our 2017 year
-
to
-
date revenues have increased 
by over $2.5 billion. In the same period, our non
-
compensation expenses 
have increased by about $300 million and total expenses by approximately 
$1.3 milli
on in the same comparison.
 
As a result, our year
-
to
-
date efficiency ratio of 72% is approximately 300 
basis points lower than the same period last year and remains well inside the 
74% target for the full
-
year. That said, we recognize that expenses in any 
o
ne quarter maybe impacted by business mix, geographical mix, seasonal 
patterns and other factors.
 
During the remainder of 2017, our focus will be on completing all remaining 
initiatives and making sure that the culture of costs discipline represented by 
pr
oject streamline remains best practice. This will help ensure that the 
savings achieved to
-
date remain permanently out of the expense based.
 
Now to the businesses. Net revenues across institutional securities 
businesses of $4.8 billion were down 8% sequent
ially. The trading 
environment slowed from the first quarter, market moving events were 
episodic, volatility in many asset classes hit multi
-
year lows and activity was 
sporadic. Despite the quarter
-
over
-
quarter decline revenues across ISG were 
strong.
 
Non
-
competition expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 6% 
sequentially driven by the UK VAT expense, as well as higher execution 
related costs due to a shift in business and geographic mix of client activity.
 
Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion wit
h the compensation to net 
revenue ratio of approximately 35%. In investment banking, both advisory 
and underwriting performed well revenues of $1.4 billion were unchanged 
versus the first quarter. This result contributed to an exceptionally strong 
first ha
lf of the year.
 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 2% sequentially. 
Broadly M&A volumes remain healthy. The fundamental drivers of activity 
including challenging organic growth remained in place encouraging client 
engagement.
 
However, we have seen a decrease in larger transformational deals on a 
year
-
to
-
date basis compared to 2016 as the current market environment is 

regulatory reform and the broader p
olitical landscape will likely weigh on 
activity. As such, we remain cautious as we look towards the rest of the 
year.
 
Turning to underwriting, our continuation of stable capital markets with low 
volatility and range down credit spreads contributed to anot
her strong 
quarter for underwriting. Overall, equity volumes continue to recover from 
the weak level seen last year particularly in Europe. The market was 
receptive to both IPOs and follow
-
on. We generated equity revenues of $405 
million, up 4%. We expect 
activity levels to remain healthy although near
-
term issuance windows maybe impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties 
and a typical summer slowdown.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 5% sequentially to $504 
million, a market wide decline in volume
s relative to strong first quarter was 
partially offset by market share gains across both investment grade bond 
and high yield financing.
 
Our sales and trading performance was solid, the post election excitement 
that began to slow towards the end of the fi
rst quarter did not reassert itself 
for most of the second quarter predominantly impacting our fixed income 
franchise.
 
However, activities saw a notable uptick towards the end of the period as 
rates felled off. This contributed to our overall performance a
nd underscores 
the strength and resilience of our franchise.
 
In equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be number one 
globally with revenues of $2.2 billion, up 7% sequentially. Strong prime 
brokerage revenues aided by seasonal factors 
contributed to the sequential 
increase.
 
We continue to witness growth in client balances positioning us well in this 
business. Derivative revenues remain solid. These gains were partially offset 
by lower cash revenues driven by lower volatility. Once again
, our diversified 
strategy and global footprint benefited from pocket to regional strength. In 
the quarter we saw a very strong European activity as well as increases up 
in Asia.
 
Fixed income revenues in the second quarter were $1.2 billion down 28% 
versus
 
a very strong first quarter and 4% versus a year ago. Historically, low 
volatility, a rally in interest rates over most of the quarter and fewer market 
events contributed to a slowdown in overall performance, while the revenue 
showed a sequential decline 

the results.
 
In our credit businesses revenues were down quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by 
lower levels of activity. Our securitized products business also witnessed a 
decrease in revenues compared to last quarter
, as the frequency of larger 
transaction slowed.
 
Within macro, our rates businesses were negatively impacted by low levels 
of volatility. This was partially offset by foreign exchange in emerging 
markets where discreet geopolitical events and pockets of vo
latility lead to 
stronger revenues. Commodities saw a sequential decline as there were 
fewer structured deals in the quarter.
 
While the environment did weigh on the results, this quarter revenues 
underscores the progress the business has made over the last
 
18 months. 
Since we restructured our business in 2015, we have experienced various 
market backdrops. Clearly, some have been more favorable than others.
 
We are encouraged by the consistency of recent results and are critically and 
credibly sized to servic
e our clients as the backdrop evolves. Average trading 
VaR for the period was $51 million up versus $44 million last quarter. We 
deployed capacities to support accretive client opportunities.
 
Now turning to wealth management, which reported another record 
quarterly revenue and pre
-
tax profit result. The revenue and margin 
achievements underscores the businesses ability to benefit from the scale of 
the platform. These results were achieved despite a normalization in activity 
following a strong first quarter 
as retail sentiment reflected the same 
uncertainties faced by our institutional clients.
 
Second quarter revenues were $4.2 billion a 2% sequential increase. The 
PBT margin 25% slightly above our full
-
year 2017 target range reflected 
growth in fee based rev
enues and operating leverage. Client assets grew 2% 
to $2.2 trillion, fee based assets increased 4% to $962 billion were 43% of 
total client assets.
 
While the department of labor fiduciary rule has contributed to these fee 
base close, the majority of the m
ovements have been from non
-
retirement 

this offering. We saw strong fee based asset flows of $20 billion.
 
Higher asset levels and positive flows contributed to asset management 
revenues of $2.3 billion representing 5% growth relative to the first quarter. 
Net interest income of $1 billion was up 2% over last quarter, that benefit a 
higher rates and lending balances was partially offset by lower deposit 
levels. This reduction in d
eposits reflects both typical seasonal client tax 
payments and deployment of cash into the markets.
 
NII was further negatively impacted by higher prepayment amortization. 
Wealth management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $3.5 billion in 
the quarter
 
or 6%, as clients drew on their SPL lines to manage liquidity 
needs, a trend we often witnessed in the second quarter.
 
Year
-
to
-
date our NII of $2 billion is up approximately $340 million or 21% 
compared to the same period last year. While market expectati
ons for 
additional rate hikes have lessened. We remain comfortable with the full
-
year NII guidance provided in Q1. In particular, we expect to continue to 
benefit from further lending risk.
 
Transactional revenues of $766 million were down 7% from Q1. While
 
clients 
deployed cash into the market, the frequency of trading captured in 
brokerage accounts decreased from the previous quarter. Again, mimicking 
the pattern witnessed in the institutional space. Lower mark
-
to
-
market gains 
on our deferred compensation 
plans were also a driver of the sequential 
decrease.
 
Total non
-
interest expenses were essentially unchanged versus Q1 
highlighting the operating leverage in this scale business. Lower 
compensation expenses were offset by seasonally higher marketing and 
bus
iness development and professional services expenses. The 
compensation ratio was below our full
-
year target of 56%.
 
Looking forward, we remain optimistic about the outlook for this business 

itized 
revenue continue to grow with fee based assets and increased loan balances. 
Additionally, our investments into improving our digital capabilities will 
enhance future productivity and provide more operating leverage to the 
franchise over time.
 
Invest
ment management witnessed a solid quarter with strength across both 
asset management fees and investment results. Total net revenues were 
$665 million up 9% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. overall, AUM grew 3% to $435 
billion driven by investment performance with pa
rticular strength across our 
active equity strategies. We also saw positive flows across our equities, fixed 
income and alternative businesses with strong capital raising internationally.
 
On the back of higher AUM, we saw a commensurate 4% growth in asset 
management fees to $539 million. Investment revenues were up 28% to a 
$125 million driven by gains in our infrastructure and real estate funds. 
Despite the 9% revenue increase, overall expenses were up only 3% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Turning to the balance s
heet, on a sequential basis total spot assets of $841 
billion were up $9 billion and average assets were up $12 billion reflecting 
continued support of client activities within the sales and trading businesses. 
Our pro forma fully phased in advance RWAs ar
e expected to be up 
approximately $22 billion versus the first quarter to $381 billion driven by 
higher market RWAs consistent with the increase in VaR metrics over the 
quarter.
 
As a result, our pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity 
Ti
er
-
1 ratio decreased approximately 70 basis points sequentially to 15.9% 
which remains in line with our pro forma fully phased in Basel III 
standardized common equity Tier
-
1 ratio. We continue to expect the two 
ratios to remain relatively close in the near
-
term. Our pro forma fully phased 
in supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter remained at 6.4%.
 
During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million of 
common stock or approximately 12 million shares. Our tax rate in the 
second quarter 
was 32%, we continue to expect our tax rate for the 
remainder of the year to be in the 32% to 33% range.
 

the outset, this quarter represented an important test of our model. 
Not
withstanding a challenging trading environment we achieved a 9% ROE 
on account of our balanced business mix and the resiliency of the franchise.
 
However, investors slightly remains fragile. The same questions that 
lingered around timing and achievability o

initiatives at the end of the first quarter remain unresolved as we enter the 
third quarter. In addition, the market continues to grapple with mixed 
economic data and questions around the timing and pace to monitory policy 
tig
htening. This dynamic may continue to weigh on activity and sentiment in 
addition to typical seasonality in the summer.
 
At the same time, we should not lose focus on the broader macroeconomic 
issues that could have a materially positive impact to our business. After 
years of headwinds for the industry, we are finally starting to see some 
tailwinds that can be promising for 
our business in the long
-
term including 
the potential for tax reform, sensible regulatory change and a rising interest 
rate environment. We are confident that we will achieve our stated goals.
 
With that, we will open the line for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
An
swer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn 
Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
First question on wealth management, I noticed the deposits down 7% I 
think, sometimes its seas


competition and what we expect on deposit data, if there are more rates 
hikes?
 
James Gorman
 
Sure Glenn. I think as I mentioned in the
 
script, it was a combination of 
both. Clearly, we normally see in the second quarter PBT deposits going 
down, because of tax season. We also saw continued deployment into the 

product


 

around the deposits including premier cash management product and some 
C

we feel good about the overall deposit franchise and the overall ability to 
fund that business as we continue to see growth in the asset side.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
So maybe bluntly, if we g
et a couple more rate hikes do you capture the 
majority of it 
-
 
even without as us said a rate story. Do you have to hike 
along the way or are the clients looking to participate in that move
-
up?
 
James Gorman
 
I think the best indication of how we feel about
 
that is really looking at the 
NII line, which is as you know has been a very good story for us. All right, 
back in 2012, we had a $1.6 billion of NII in wealth business, last year was 
$3.5 billion grew more than $500 million. In February, we talked about 
what 
we thought we would see and we thought we would continue to see good 
growth in the NII line, albeit at a slightly slower pace. Year
-
to
-
date were at 
$2 billion, which is up over $340 million over last year.
 
So again, we feel very confident about that s
tory, it is reliant on the lending 
growth, which we saw a good growth across all the product this quarter. So 
we feel good about that, I think the composition is a little different, your 

mode


hikes faster than we thought back then.
 
On the other side of the ledger, you just mentioned the deposits are dow
n. 
So, we brought down the liquidity pool in the banks as well as started to use 
other savings and deposit products as well as some wholesale funding to 

-
payment acceleration that w
e saw in the second quarter as rates went down. 

a good story, but the composition has been a little different.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bren
nan Hawken 
with UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first on [Indiscernible] 
really again encouraging to see the sustained stability, say that a few times 
-
 
now that clearly you demonstrated some st
ability here after the 
repositioning. Has there been a shift in mix. Can you give us a sense for the 
different business lines now that the business has been adjusted and can 
you also 
-
 
I know you mentioned Jon that commodities were down 
sequentially, but w

heard some mixed things from some of the competitors some additional 
color there will be great. Thanks.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

rly 
just reflect the environment that we were operating in. if you look over year
-
over
-
year the results are pretty flat. So, when we look at the individual 
product mix, as I did mention our rates business given the low volatility is 
down, yet our FX did a 
little bit stronger particularly in the emerging market 
areas.
 
Credits were hung in there, less movement in credit spreads this quarter, 
but again comparable type of results in light of effected the year
-
over
-
year 
results were essentially flat. So we feel 
good about the business, 
commodities are also down a little bit, less activity and a tighter trading 
band there, but the results reflect the moves and the changes that we made 
and the results reflect that the business is really starting to come together 
an
d jelling and I think we feel pretty good about the results in light of the 
environment.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Right. So I guess from your perspective paraphrasing you said that 
commodities were tough, but not necessarily extraordinarily difficult or 
remarkable i
n that way?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, listen the commodity business that we have has been totally reshaped 
and resized, more traditional sales and trading supporting our client base. 

 
Ope
rator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak 
with Nomura. Your line is now open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Good morning. So, wanted to started up with the question on wealth 
management and pre
-
tax margin, certainly encouraging to see 
that you guys 

to the second half, given a number of favorable trends for the business that 

growth and NII 

market shocks whether you can sustain margins above that 25% target for 
the remainder of the year.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen, I think you highlighted what we think is driving that margin. Right 
now, with t
he rates and higher markets those are good trends that will drive 
our asset base fees as well as our NII, our lending growth has been solid, I 
think the one area of potential volatility or softening is around transactional. 
We are heading into the summer m
onths, but again, I think the tailwinds for 
this business are very good. We saw really nice operating leverage here, we 
saw really nice growth across all products in the lending book and we feel 
very good about the results, I mean the PBT at $1 billion plu
s is obviously a 

 
Steven Chubak
 
Thanks and just one follow
-
up on capital. You guys had outlined a couple of 
the potential benefits to your business in terms of capital release that wer
e 

bit of focus is this notion that the prospects for cash and liquid assets to be 

-
1 
leverage constraint in CC
AR of 4% appears to be a binding constraint for the 


whether they were considering that possibility and what tha
t might mean for 
you guys in terms of capital release?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
On the first part of the question I think clearly the reform around SLR would 

this quarter or next quarter
 
is certainly not a foregone conclusion. So there 
could be some benefit from that but we also think there is just general 
benefit with that calculation in terms of what it means for their overall sales 
and trading businesses. But I do think there are sever
al changes have been 
discussed or that are being discussed that would clearly help our position 
including around the balance sheet and how you think about capital actions 
going forward.
 

on, but 
clearly we were pleased with the results, if you look back at year ago where 
we were versus what came out of the report a couple of weeks ago with a 
100%ish payout and a 33% increase in capital return and a clean report 

 
James Go
rman
 
I would just add on the leverage ratio, specifically, we have argued for a 
number of years and present to regulators for a number of years that the 
fact that a balance sheet growth during the time of financial stress is hard to 
understand how that hap
pens. As such depreciate assets run off, new 
businesses not gathered, it would be hard to imagine in fact during the crisis 
in the years following of our own balance sheet obviously shrink dramatically 
both through our actions and through market activity.
 
So the leverage ratio constraint is made more acute by the fact that the 

quarters. There being quite a lot of sympathy to that view that if we should 
look not at some blanket growth rate
, but what actually experience was 
during the crisis and during other periods of financial stress. And I think that 
experience would largely hold up the balance sheet shrink.
 
So if you just held our balance sheet flat for that time period, that would 
have 
a material impact on our leverage ratio. So I think there is certainly a 
good dialogue going on through the treasury white paper and with the 
regulators on that topic alone.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the 
line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning. Just looking at the VaR and the [indiscernible] metrics, which 

depending on whi
ch one you look at. So could you give us a sense for given 
that those are average daily I guess metrics. What we look like at on a spot 
basis towards the end of the quarter, should we be expecting that these 
things will close down again?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Su
re. A couple of things. So on the VaR metric, obviously the 51 million was 
the average for the quarter. If you have queue, it was actually 57 at period 
end at March 31. So that actually came down overtime and it has actually 
continue to come down and the s
pot period end will be lower than the 51 
that we said.
 
On the RWA comments, actually some of the calculations are daily average 
volumes, some of them 12
-
week averages. And the VaR metrics are 
important in those calculations. So I think the same trend that 

the VaR would be consistent in terms of how we finished out quarter end in 
that metrics. With the ratio that we have at CET1 even at the 16 or 59 level, 

 
Guy Moszkowski
 

-
up question is more targeted 
on SIC. Specifically given the success that you have had in generating 
revenue even in a period like the one that we just had which was certainly 
weaker characterize by low vol, et
 
cetera on the things that you have said. 
Would you consider raising your quarterly average expectation from that $1 

 
James Gorman
 


the targets discussion. We just went on the pre
-
tax margin a few questions 

consistent, we took these targets for proof of business model for this year. 

o stay with them. We think, listen, we were 
-
 
recall certain 
fourth quarter 2015, we were doing 500 million and 600 million in SIC first 
quarter of 2016, I think if memory serves its about 800 million.
 
A billion dollar number on a study run rate basis is a
 
good number with 25% 
less people much smaller organization, much more focused organization. If 

point of setting the target to establish, what we needed to prove to 
ourselves o
n an average run rate for the business to justify the expenses in 
capital balance sheet that we put behind it at that level. Everything we do 
better than that with the same expenses capital and balance sheet is 
obviously a gift.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our
 
next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with 
Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Good morning. Maybe a follow
-
up in the SLR and the treasury report. If we 
assume that both the Tier
-
1 leverage ratio and the SLR treated 
similarly by 
exempting cash and maybe short
-
term treasuries. How do you think that 
impacts the business, I guess, I think a lot of people are asking the question 
of? Is this a revenue opportunity to kind of re
-
expand the business whether 
it would be REPO o
r other businesses or is it really more of an excess capital 
story. Just trying to get a sense of, if you think business has been held back 
by the SLR?
 
James Gorman
 
Let me tell start with and Jon might want to add to it. First and foremost this 
is a capita
l question. We believe, we are over capitalized. There were good 
reasons for that several years ago as we were coming out of those financial 

a row to $0.25. Our initial buyback p
rogram was zero then went to $500 and 

ratio is closing in on 100%. So we clearly believe that we are over 
capitalized and for good reasons we were coming off the crisis and we 
need
ed to shore up our defenses.
 
There is plenty of opportunity for business expansion with the amount of 
capital we have today. The more fundamental issue is what is the right level 
of capital this firm should hold. Are we holding too much capital, because th
e 
way the leverage ratio is being constructed, what is the right denominator 

sheet and that the growth of balance sheet. In the U.S. they took the 
[indiscernible] balance sheet 
ratio of 5% and attached it to this SLR balance 
sheet from Europe. So we sort of ended up with a fairly [draconian] (Ph) 
answer.
 

be taken out of the SLR that obviously make sen
se. Number two, to not 
gross up the balance sheet under the core leverage ratio make sense. And I 
think we have capacity at that point both for further capital distributions and 
for sensible business growth. You saw the RWAs bounce a little bit this 
quarte
r, that was consistent with sensible business growth, there was 
opportunity clearly Tier
-
1 capital ratio is another constraint or no way near 

 
Jim Mitchell
 

maybe as a follow
-
up on just the treasury report 
generally. Is there any other aspects of the proposals that you would be 
particularly helpful for your business?
 
James Gorman
 

off
 
the top of my head. I think clearly, I think there is a general recognition 
from the regulators all the way through the treasury that the Volcker Rule as 
it play out overtime straight a fair bit distance from Paul Walker initially 
envisaged, which was a s
imple restriction on the amount of capital put into 
proprietary invest and proprietary trading and but then frankly constrained 
on the ability of institutions to make markets and effective market liquidity. 
So I think the treasury reports spoke about that.
 
There was reference to the fact that the banks are required to continue their 
payouts, not withstanding there in the period of financial stress for nine 
quarters, no bank board would authorize continuing on buyback program 
during a financial crisis, that 


material effect on the institutions.
 


 


-



e cumulative effect 
of a lot of these regulations in some cases end up if you will with a double 
counting. And I think the spirit of the treasury report reflected that. I think 
they are focused on sensible pragmatic change, they are not focused on 
trying t

approach.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with 
JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe first here just 
in wealth management, 


to be able to focus on the children of the existing clients and some lower 
bala
nce accounts which does seem to mark us with this generation of wealth 
transfer coming here and where the money is going to be over the next 
several decades. So as we think about that process, how do you protect 
against maybe some cannibalization of existi
ng business as clients look at 
the lower price point. You know I guess the question is a revenue 
opportunity here just much more of an offset or do you just not think this as 
something that would appeal to some of your existing higher net worth 
clients for
 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

and the robo strategies is pretty accurate. Listen, we have a business that is 
built to cater to clie
nts with wealth. Those wealth clients want advice, they 

coming out of brokerage into the fee based accounts. Obviously digital is 
going to be an important part of that strategy, b
ut the digital only client is 
not someone right now that would generally be interested in the types of 
products and services that we have.
 
We think the digital strategy is going to be important for both revenue 
opportunities longer term but also optimizati
on and efficiency around what 


longer term but the thesis of our business is around providing people with
 
personnel advice around their wealth and their planning.
 
James Gorman
 

actually saw this maybe once before in 1999 when the direct players came 
out and the big fear was cannibalization
. That would only have held true if 


the marketplace has different segments based on consumer preference a
nd I 

segment whether they change their behavior as they become wealthy 
remains to be seen. But there is clearly a segment that wants to deal 
digitally just as so the segment that
 
wanted to deal through direct brokerage 
trading and so on.
 

look at the average basis points paid from the various robo platforms, they 
range in general like things from some
thing like 20 to 40 basis points. If you 
look at the average basis points for a full service advisory like us, just divide 
our revenue into our assets including everything, you get somewhere in the 
70s, low 70 basis points. So the value added of the financ
ial buys and the 
institutions behind it and the research, the product offering, the new issued 
calendar you could argue is being putout there for 30 to 40 basis points.
 

lead to t

compelling digital platform to deal with clients who want to deal with Morgan 

traditional wealth management a

opportunity for us, frankly given our brand and add technology capabilities.
 
Devin Ryan
 


 
six months of method to in 

curious with respect to expectations there, is this something that you feel 

 
market share or just Morgan Stanley is going to take market share of the 


implementation?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. Well, I
 

terms of dialogues with clients, but also systems and technology related 

very hard to estimate what the impact of this 
is. Any time you have a 
change of this magnitude where you just sort of flip a switch. We would 
expect the potential for disruption to be pretty high, how would affects 

alrea
dy doing this.
 


have some clients [indiscernible] off that European operation. So how it all 
plays out is certainly 
unclear. But given the fact that we are number one in 
the world in this business and we have a full service platform and intellectual 
capital and product. There is consolidation in a number of counter parties. 
We would expect to participate in that, but I 

call here and trying to estimate the impact is also probably a little early to 
make a call.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski 
with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now 
open.
 
Chris Kotowski
 
Yes. I mean recognizing the excellent outcome that you had in the CCAR 
capital return process. I have to say, I was surprised a week before, when 
the DFAS results came out that, that still shows Morgan Stanley has been 
severely impacte
d by the severely adverse scenario. That said, the booklet 
shows you losing 8.4 percentage points of capital and against the median of 

-
risking your balance sheet. I would 
have thought that we would have seen more progr
ess in that and can you 
tell us what it is in the fed methodology that seems to cut against you, so 
disproportionally?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, we were very pleased with the results. We had the same issue last 
year around DFAS and people sort of concerned wi
th our outcome and about 
100% payout ratio continue to increased capital return, part of our core 
strategy. We clearly have de
-
risked the balance sheet or RWA density is 
lower and basically every other firm out there, which is why you see some of 
that disp
araging percentages. If you look at the leverage base ratio, as you 
get a slighter different picture. We clearly had de
-


several years have come down.
 
We 
have met our strategic objective of increasing capital return. We still 

that statement. We said, we were capital sufficient, we did not want to grow 
our equity base, we have grown our
 
equity base a couple of billion dollars, 


the balance sheet and we feel very comfortable with our capital 
position.
 
James Gorman
 

The construction of operating risk capital, the various stress falls that are in 
there, counter party risks, how the trading book is managed, how you derive 
your PP&I, there is a hell of lot of stuff that goes into this. Our own 


focused on how to make both the
 
models more transparent, the process 
more transparent and to make some sensible adjustments for it.
 

the past was. What I do care is that our distribution this year approved to is
 



operating now currently with 
about 100% pass. So I would let this one play 
out a little bit and see what comes out of the treasury efforts.
 
Chris Kotowski
 
Okay. And I mean I guess the thing is right, just again if you look at the old 
way of doing it right, if you need at five, after t
he stress then you were 
losing eight or nine and you need one for a margin of safety that would 
suggest you need to see T1 ratio on a 14%, 15% on an operating basis, I 
mean is there an outlook for like operating at less than that?
 
James Gorman
 
I think you 
are torturing yourself by looking it backwards. Honestly, I 



process being undertaken 
right now.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with 
Societe Generale. Your line is now open.
 
Andrew Lim
 
Hi there. Can I foresee a bit more new claim of excess capital? As things 


excess capital as contingent on changes kind of true form the treasury or as 
you say the fed being more lenie
nt on how do you guys leverage 
[Indiscernible] stress scenario. And so I mean can you give a bit more color 
on that?
 
James Gorman
 

capital payouts while the tests become consistent

at a 100% payouts, by definition, any excess capital we have and gating 
constraint was the leverage ratio this year and we were above the gating 
constraint after we did our distribution, so by definition we are carrying 
excess cap
ital.
 
And our view is that, the way we calculate our capital needs to run our 

outcome of the white paper and the various efforts from the regulators to 
see what changes take place, 
there are clearly going to be changes. How 
favorable they are and to what extent they fit Morgan Stanley remains to be 
seen is not going to be productive to try and guess that.
 
Andrew Lim
 
Right. Understood. And just a follow up question. [Indiscernible] ba
ckground 

when you might get some disclosure of the impact on capital ratios or the 
timing?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

 
area. I think the thing that sometimes people fail to recognize is we 
obviously have this white paper and if you think about it, we are actually 
going to enter a period of refinement and adjustment to regulations versus 
where we were a year ago, where our
 
expectation was incremental 

going to be in a better place. Now how that plays out and what timeframe 

 
entering a different period going forward that we have been in the last eight 
years.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Gerrard Cassidy 
with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Gerrard Cassidy
 
Thank you, good 
morning. Can you guys share with us once we get into a 
more normalized return on capital environment that we see in the future. 
What kind of dividend payout ratio are you guys comfortable with as we look 
further out?
 
James Gorman
 

probably serves us well to get a head of that 
discussion with the regulators and others. I think the current regulatory 
environment anticipates for the G
-
Sifi banks at payout ratios of something 
like 30% and for some of the smaller institutions I think the

than that maybe up to 40%. Whether that changes, you know post all the 


 
So one way to think about our business which is I thought about it for a 
wh
ile the wealth management business is almost like a yield stock. So you 
can imagine the dividend coming out of wealth management earnings and 
obviously the institutional businesses are more volatile overtime. So they are 
more capital distribution businesse
s or capital investment businesses. But I 

currently being given to us by regulators.
 
Gerrard Cassidy
 
Okay, great. And then second in the supplement package, on page five you 
give us the to
tal loans of the organization. And could you share with us 
some color on 
-
 
I may have missed this I apologize if I did. Why the 
corporate loans were down 37% or so year
-
over
-
year and a little color 

alth 
management side where those loans are up 20%.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

changes in the corporate book are really around the size of the event book in 
sort of the event activity as well as 
some just overall management of the 
relationship book. The real story for us is as you mentioned has been in the 
wealth business as we continue to increase the penetration of our client base 
with lending products. The growth has been very good across all o
f our three 
core products the SPL, the mortgage and tailored lending.
 

$3.5 billion was pretty balanced across the business a little bit more skewed 
towards SPL and tailored versus mortg
age given what happened in rates, 
but again that lending story we feel very good about, our levels of 
penetration of how many of our clients have lending products is still probably 
a bit below peer level. So we expect or feel good about the ability to 
cont

business.

Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Christopher 
Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open.
 
Christopher Wheeler
 
Yes, good morning. A couple of qu
estions on wealth management. I think 

your big competitors are now stepping back from filing away experience 
financial advisors and obviously in doing obviously reducing the cost of 
amortizing the [indiscernible] senior producers. I would like to perhaps 


with the end of the Smith Barney p
ayouts and talk about what you think this 
might do to your pre
-
tax margin, because I think at one said you say it 
might add, once a Smith Barney payouts retention packages run out, I 
mean, next year. You might be adding 1.5% percentage points deal your 
pre
-
tax margin. So a bit of color there would be helpful. Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 


numerator and denominator,
 
but 1.5% increase is a reasonable 
approximation and obviously that will drop directly to the bottom
-
line. In 

and that is obviously helpful both in terms of just ins and outs. The

associated would bring in new FAs, but also when a FA leads generally 

So just lower levels of recruiting and lower levels of attrition has been 
overall helpful to the busine
ss.

And when you just want to decide whether do you think your competitor is 
holding the line, but it does seem like the beneficial move, but there are one 
or two players out there, of course, still sort of quite came take away some 
of 
your senior people?

ys 

frankly, there are fewer competitors, if you think Morgan Stanley, Morgan 
Stanley is now a composites that includes Dean Witter Reynolds & Company, 
Robinson, Humphrey, Legg Maso
n, Smith Barney, Shearson, Hutton. And 

it, recruit against each of it.
 

there are fewer numbers, all th
at I think the deal structures have become 
shall I say more sensible, there was a bit of a crazy period there. So, yes, 
but there will always be some recruiting and that make sense to many 
people ever right to getting work whether want to work.

Th
ank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl 
with KBW. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
Okay thanks. Maybe just a first question on equity sales and trading. I think 
this is probably third or fourth quarter now, you called 
out strength and time 
broker. As a driver of those revenues, can you maybe give us a little bit 

clients more active, is it client growth?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
The simple answer is ye
s to all of those. Very strong quarter, the growth was 
across all of the regions, particularly stand out being EMEA, given some of 
seasonality there. Balances are up, we continue to invest in the balance 

 

full service platform and our clients have been very responsive to that.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
And then second question, can you give us an update on kind of where the 
banking pipeline stand especially for M&A, it seems like there is 
been pick
-
up 
and activity thus far early in the third quarter, I mean how does the pipeline 
stand at the end of the second quarter versus first quarter?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I would say that, first of all its very early in the third quarter, point number 


But overall, the equity and, debt underwriting remains healthy. IPOs backlog 
is healthy and broad an
d activities picked up really nicely here. So again a 

to see how that impacts us as well as all of the sort of policy uncertainty, 
uncertainty that we talked about in the past. But rig
ht now, pretty healthy.

7/21/16,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During 
today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial 
supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.
 
Today's presentation may include 
forward
-
looking statements that are 
subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ 
materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward
-
looking statements 
and non
-
GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This 
pres
entation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.
 
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Thanks, Sharon. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. 
While the third 
quarter was impacted by the typical summer slowdown 
across many of our businesses, our results reaffirmed that we can generate 
solid returns against a more subdued backdrop. Strong performance in 
Wealth Management and Investment Management and stable resul
ts in the 
market
-
sensitive businesses demonstrated the importance of the balanced 
business model.
 
Wealth Management posted record revenues. Margins remained in excess of 
our target range. These results were achieved despite slower transactional 
activity. W
e continue to witness growth in fee
-
based assets, which surpassed 
$1 trillion in this quarter. Clients continued to choose the enhanced service 
models provided by this offering. This trend has reduced our resilience 
--
 
our 
reliance on transactional activit
y. Incremental revenues will continue to drive 
margin improvement, subject, of course, to decisions to invest in initiatives 
that have the potential to further accelerate growth. These investments 
include not only our digital build
-
out but also further enh
ancements to our 
advisory platforms, lending cash management products and integrated, 
goal
-
based planning solutions.
 
Within Institutional Securities, Investment Banking showed continued 
strength, particularly in advisory, notwithstanding the amount of unce
rtainty 
around the political and fiscal outlook. Sales & Trading was impacted by the 
environment, characterized by a seasonal slowdown, muted client activity 
and low levels of volatility. That said, Equity Sales & Trading demonstrated 
consistency despite s
ubdued activity. Fixed Income remained above our $1 
billion run rate per our average quarterly revenue goal, and Investment 
Management exhibited steady performance with a combination of positive 
flows across our actively managed strategies.
 
Often an undera
ppreciated part of our firm, Investment Management 
represents a high
-
returning business with a complementary mix of 
traditional and alternative platforms. We continue to explore both organic 
and inorganic opportunities in this space. Our pending acquisitio
n of Mesa 
West Capital serves as the most recent example. Mesa West complements 
our existing real estate product offerings and provides us with an 
opportunity to leverage our current distribution channels.
 
We continued to see signs of operating leverage ac
ross our business model, 
not just in Wealth Management, where it's most apparent. Incremental 
revenue is expected to generate higher margins, assuming we continue to 
manage our cost base with discipline. That said, we won't be shy about 
reinvesting where w
e see market and competitive opportunities. The Mesa 
West acquisition and the continuing build
-
out of our U.S. banks serve as 
examples of this choice.
 
Finally, as has been widely discussed in every corner of our sector, there are 
3 additional medium
-
 
to lo
ng
-
term drivers of performance improvements for 
our industry, corporate taxes, rates and any changes to the regulatory 
framework. To repeat what is commonly understood, as a firm, we have a 
relatively high corporate tax rate given our meaningful U.S. prese
nce. 
Second, we continue to be positioned to benefit from higher interest rates. 
And third, we are heavily regulated, not least in the area of capital, which 
culminates with the CCAR exam. While the degree of these changes will 
become clearer only over tim
e, they should not go unnoted. In the near 
term, we continue to have good client receptivity around the globe. And 
absent any material changes to macro conditions, we remain confident in the 
goals we have set for this year.
 
I'll now turn the call over to J
on.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you, and good morning. The operating environment we witnessed in 
the third quarter, in many respects, represented a continuation of the 
second quarter's market conditions. Client conviction remained limited. 
Activity and volatilit
y were muted across several markets, impacting Sales & 
Trading in particular. Typical summer patterns added to the lackluster tone. 
Despite this somewhat uninspired trading environment, results remained 
solid with strong performance in Investment Banking a
nd Investment 
Management and consistent revenue growth in Wealth Management. At $9.2 
billion, firm revenues were in excess of $9 billion for the fourth consecutive 
quarter. In the quarter, PBT was $2.5 billion and EPS was $0.93. ROE was 
9.6%. These numbers
 
were aided by certain tax benefits that I will discuss 
in detail shortly. These tax benefits contributed approximately $0.05 of EPS 
and 50 basis points of ROE.
 
Our year
-
to
-
date efficiency ratio of 72% is well inside the 74% target we've 
set for 2017. This
 
is evidence that the Project Streamline expense savings 
initiatives we embarked on at the beginning of last year are coming to 
fruition. Underscoring the firm's operating leverage, year
-
to
-
date revenue is 
up $2.8 billion or 11%, and pretax profit is up $1
.3 billion or 20% over the 
same period last year.
 
Going forward, our focus will be on ensuring that the savings achieved to 
date are kept permanently out of the expense base in an effort to maximize 
operating leverage across all of our businesses. Over the
 
quarter, non
-
compensation expenses were down $63 million or 2%, primarily driven by 
the absence of the VAT provision recorded in the second quarter. We 
continue to exercise compensation discipline, contributing to a 2% 
sequential decline in total noninter
est expense.
 
Now to the businesses. Net revenues in our Institutional Securities 
businesses of $4.4 billion were down 8% sequentially. In addition to the 
seasonal slowdown across several of the businesses, volatility in many asset 
classes remained at or ne
ar multiyear lows. And there were fewer 
idiosyncratic market
-
moving events. Consequently, client activity slowed 
from the second quarter. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for 
the quarter, down 3% sequentially. Compensation expenses were $1.5 
bil
lion. Our year

date compensation to net revenue ratio was 
approximately 35%, in line with our target of 37% or lower.
 
Investment Banking continued to show strength in advisory and debt 
underwriting. Revenues of $1.3 billion were down 10% versus a strong
 
second quarter. We continue to leverage our global franchise, working with 
clients to provide holistic solutions. This consistent focus has contributed to 
an improvement in several of our market positions. Advisory revenues for 
the quarter were $555 milli
on, up 10% sequentially. Despite a decrease in 
larger transformational deals, M&A volumes are healthy and on par with last 
year's levels. A combination of challenging organic growth and attractive 
financing markets continues to drive activity.
 
Turning to u
nderwriting. While equity volumes have recovered relative to the 
low levels of activity experienced over the course of last year, the quarter
-
over
-
quarter results showed a traditional seasonal trend with slower activity 
in the summer months. We generated e
quity underwriting revenues of $273 
million, down 33% sequentially. We expect healthy activity levels in the 
fourth quarter, subject to issuance windows remaining open, which may be 
impacted by macro
-
economic uncertainties, geopolitical events and a typica
l 
seasonal slowdown at the end of the year.
 
Fixed Income underwriting revenues decreased 12% sequentially to $442 
million, driven primarily by lower investment
-
grade issuance. High
-
yield 
markets have continued to be very receptive to both acquisition finan
cing 
and opportunistic refinancings, aided by range
-
bound credit spreads, low 
volatility and significant market liquidity. Overall, Investment Banking 
pipelines are healthy and diversified across products, regions and sectors. 
CEO confidence remains high, 
and we are actively engaged with our clients. 
However, we maintain a cautious outlook as political and policy uncertainties 
may influence management's decision to act.
 
In Sales & Trading, we supported our clients when opportunities presented 
themselves and
 
prudently managed risk throughout the quarter. Our results 
were consistent with the market backdrop. And overall, revenues were in 
line with historical third quarters. In Equities, we retained our leadership 
position and expect to be #1 globally. Revenues
 
were $1.9 billion, down 
12% sequentially. Our global footprint and diversified strategy continued to 
enable us to benefit from pockets of regional strength.
 
Sequentially, Europe was weaker coming off a seasonally high second 
quarter, but continued strengt
h in Asia buoyed our results. Prime Brokerage 
revenues remain a source of stability and client balances continue to grow. 
Derivatives saw a sequential decrease on fewer corporate transactions, 
which can be lumpy. And cash revenues remain stable as lower vo
lumes and 
subdued volatility were combined with a more benign market
-
making 
environment.
 
Fixed Income revenues in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, down 6% 
versus the second quarter. Our macro businesses were negatively impacted 
by sequentially lower re
sults in foreign exchange and persistently low levels 
of volatilities in rates, where client activity remain muted. As we have 
discussed, activity in these businesses is often aided by discrete events or 
meaningful market trends. Lack of such events or tre
nds weighed on results. 
In credit, revenues were also down quarter
-
over
-
quarter. In aggregate, 
spreads remained at very tight levels, negatively impacting volatility and 
client demand. Commodities saw a sequential increase as activity improved 
in the quart
er.
 
Overall, this quarter's results reinforce the progress we have made in this 
business. We have continued to support our clients and have generated 
revenues in excess of the $1 billion goal for 6 consecutive quarters against a 
variety of market backdrops
. We remain confident in the strategy outlined 
nearly 2 years ago and we are pleased with the performance. Lastly, 
average trading VaR for the period was $43 million, down versus $51 million 
last quarter, primarily driven by lower market volatility across 
both equity 
and fixed income markets.
 
Turning to Wealth Management, which reported further growth in both 
revenues and pretax profits relative to last quarter's record levels. Our 
business continues to benefit from a shift towards an advice
-
driven model 
wi
th a decreased reliance on transactional activity. This quarter's results 
further underscored this trend as growth in asset management revenues 
more than offset the seasonal slowdown in transactional revenues.
 
Third quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a 2%
 
sequential increase. At 
26.5% for the quarter, the PBT margin now exceeds 25% year
-
to
-
date. The 
margin increase reflects the benefit of our scale platform with operating 
leverage across both compensation and non
-
compensation expenses. Year
-
to
-
date, revenu
e grew 9% or $1.1 billion. At the same time, we saw a total 
expenses growth of only 5% with non
-
compensation expenses down and 
continued compensation discipline. As a result, pretax profit is up 24%.
 
Total client assets grew by 3% to $2.3 trillion. We cont
inue to witness strong 
client demand for our advisory solutions. Fee
-
based asset inflows were $16 
billion in the quarter, contributing to a record year
-
to
-
date flows. These 
flows represent an important organic growth driver of this business. Total 
fee
-
base
d assets increased 4% and are now in excess of $1 trillion or 43% 
of total client assets. Higher asset levels and strong quarterly flows 
contributed to asset management revenues of $2.4 billion, representing 4% 
growth relative to the second quarter. Net in
terest income of $1 billion is up 
2% over the last quarter, reflecting the benefit from both higher rates and 
lending balances. This was partially offset by higher funding costs, which 
include a higher blended BDP rate as well as the cost of incremental CD
s, 
saving products and third
-
party liabilities that are part of our diversified 
bank funding strategy.
 
Wealth Management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $1 billion in 
the quarter or 2%. Continued strength in loan production offset the impact 
of hig
her paydowns in the quarter. With year
-
to
-
date net interest income of 
$3 billion, up approximately 19% year
-
on
-
year, we remain on our way to 
generate full year NII growth in line with the guidance we had provided. 
Transactional revenues of $739 million wer
e down 4% from Q2. The decline 
reflected a typical decrease in retail engagement during the summer months 
across both equity and fixed income markets as well as the slower 
underwriting calendar.
 
Total noninterest expenses were essentially unchanged versus 
Q2. The 
compensation ratio was 55%, in line with our stated targets. Non
-
compensation expenses were down 3% sequentially due to seasonally lower 
marketing and business development expenses. This quarter's performance 
clearly demonstrates the strength of th
e franchise and the powerful 
combination of a highly annuitized revenue mix and the operating leverage 
that comes from a scale platform. We continued to enhance this business 
profile by investing in our advisory platforms, digital capabilities and banking 
and lending products.
 
Investment Management witnessed another solid quarter with continued 
growth in asset management fees and strong investment results. Total net 
revenues were $675 million, up 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Overall, AUM grew 
3% to $447 
billion. We witnessed positive flows and strong investment 
performance, particularly across our active equity strategies. We continue to 
see increased investor interest in our high
-
conviction strategies across the 
platform. On the back of higher AUM, we sa
w 5% growth in asset 
management fees to $568 million. Investment revenues were also strong at 
$114 million, primarily due to more recent private funds entering carry. As 
discussed in the past, we expect this line item to continue to be lumpy. 
Overall expen
ses of $544 million were up 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven 
by higher compensation expense on carried interest.
 
As James mentioned, in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Mesa 
West Capital. This will complement our existing real estate and private
 
credit 
offering with a premier commercial real estate credit strategy. The 
transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to 
opportunistically evaluate tactical acquisitions across our Investment 
Management platform as we further
 
grow this high
-
return business.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. On a sequential basis, total spot assets of 
$854 billion were up $13 billion. In the quarter, the binding constraint for 
our risk
-
based capital ratios shifted from advanced to the standardized 
approach framework. Our pro forma fully phased
-
in standardized RWAs are 
expected to be essentially unchanged as higher credit RWAs offset a decline 
in market
-
risk RWAs. Our pro forma fully phased
-
in Basel III standardized 
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is expe
cted to increase slightly to 16.3%. Our 
pro forma fully phased
-
in supplementary leverage ratio is expected to 
remain at 6.5%.
 
During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.25 billion of 
common stock or approximately 27 million shares and our b
oard declared a 
$0.25 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 28.1%. This 
included a total of $94 million of net discrete tax benefits, $11 million related 
to the recurring type of discrete tax item for employee share
-
based 
payments and t
he balance primarily resulting from the remeasurement of 
certain deferred tax assets 
--
 
excuse me, deferred taxes.
 
This quarter, results reaffirm that our balanced business model is 
performing. At the beginning of 2016, we presented a 2
-
year plan. Over the
 
last 7 quarters, we have witnessed a variety of economic backdrops. And 
while this quarter certainly did not present the most constructive backdrop 
for some of our businesses, our performance was consistent with our stated 
objectives. We are encouraged by
 
the continued growth in our more 
annuitized businesses, providing a buffer to those businesses that are more 
sensitive to quarterly changes in the environment. We remain focused on 
executing our strategic plan throughout the rest of the year and, absent a
ny 
material changes to macro conditions, we are confident that we will hit our 
stated objectives.
 
With that, we will open up the line to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of 
Jim 
Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
 
James Mitchell
 
Maybe just on the Wealth Management side, you guys had very good growth 
--
 
sequential growth in deposits. There's been some discussion in the 
industry about kind of a pricing pressure. Can you discuss w
here you saw 
deposit rates in Wealth Management business and how you were able to 
attract, I think, about $10 billion sequentially on deposit franchise?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I think, as you recall, we've been talking about our deposit 
deployment strategy 
for quite some time. And we've been investing excess 
liquidity into our loan product over the last several years. In the beginning of 
the year, we told you that, that trend would come to an end. We did see that 
this year. It happened a bit sooner than we a
nticipated as we saw more cash 
go into the markets, particularly the equity markets as those markets rose 
around the world. And we've seen cash in our clients' accounts at its lowest 
level. So what we had been doing over the last several years is building 
out 
our product suite in that business. As you recall, we were really just a solo 
product with the BDP product. So we've built out those products, particularly 
around our cash management engaged initiatives around savings products 
as well as CDs and other 
products to sort of supplement our deposit base.
 
In terms of the pricing, we had 4 rate hikes over the last 2 years. We did, at 
the end of the second quarter raise our rates across the platform in the 
broker deposit channel. Those rates were predominantly 
sort of pegged at 1 
or 2 basis points. They're now on average about 6 basis points. But we have 
been supplementing our deposit base with other savings products and CDs. 
And you see the cost of that running through the interest expense line. So 
started the 
year at $154 billion of deposits, it drifted down to $144 billion as 
people engaged in the market and deployed their cash. And it's now back at 
$154 billion again with a slightly different mix, but back to sort of the 
historical year
-
end level.
 
James Mitch
ell
 
Okay, great. And maybe, just the follow
-
up, just on your asset management 
acquisitions, you've got sort of a new tone, I guess, or more aggressive tone 
about further acquisitions. Is there particular asset classes you're looking at? 
Is it focused still
 
on alternatives? Or do you see you'd like to have scale in 
other asset classes?
 
James Gorman
 
I think there are a bunch of areas across the asset management platform we 
could continue to build out. We have looked obviously at Fixed Income, 
where we have sm
aller space. We have a relatively narrow but very 
productive active asset management business on the long
-
only side. And so 
there are some geographic areas where we could fill in. In this case, it was 
in the alternatives platform. Real estate has been, for
 
most of our history, a 
tremendous strength. We have a great team running it. The business is 
doing well. They've launched new funds. This made sense to us. So I think 
what we're signaling, and Jim, you're picking up on it, is we're open for 
business to fi
nd inorganic pieces that can help build out parts of our platform 
that make sense. We're not looking for any grand splash here, but we're 
open for business opportunistically. And this was a perfect example. We 
looked at another deal over the last couple of
 
quarters. And in the end, it got 
too expensive, we pulled away from it. So we're going to keep pricing 
discipline.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Just a follow
-
up on Jim's question on the weal
th deposit cost and the CD 
program. The CD program has gotten a lot of attention. And it certainly 
seems to be successful here in bumping up the deposit base. How much of 
the $25 million in interest expense that you guys saw quarter
-
over
-
quarter 
was attrib
utable to this CD program? And when you guys think about that 
cash, I believe it's an 11
-
month program, how sticky do you think that is? 
And what are you guys working on to try to make sure it's as sticky as 
possible?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. Let me try to ta
ke a crack at that. There are a couple of different 
points. Just remember, we have not made a huge effort historically to build 
out incremental products in the wealth 
--
 
in the deposit side, because we 
were sitting on so many excess deposits. So this is ne
w for us. We've been 
working on this cash management engaged initiative as well as building out 
sort of traditional CD products. And we will continue to diversify our funding 
mix and our liability stack. And we also have access to wholesale markets, 
includ
ing brokerage CDs and FHLB and external sweeps and other things. So 
this is really around the right composition and mix of a liability stack. In 
terms of the interest expense, Brennan, it was a combination of both. The 
increase 
--
 
the BDP increase really h
appened at the very end of the second 
quarter, taking up from 1 
--
 
a little over 1 basis point to 6 basis points.
 
So some of that increase is from that; and the rest would be from a 
combination of the CDs. We ran some savings promotions as well. Mind you, 
this is for existing clients and new money only. And we're obviously not 
alone in running promotional programs to increase the deposit levels. I think 
in terms of stickiness, as James has mentioned and I have mentioned, we 
are seeing more of our clients en
gage with us on the advisory platforms. 
We're providing more services and products for them. And I think we're 
approaching the clients holistically both on the asset as well as the liability 
side. As I said, we're new to this, so we'll have to see what the
 
numbers 
play out. But we're very confident regarding the liquidity position that we 
have in the banks.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay, great. And 
--
 
okay, so the BDP came at the end of the quarter, so 
there might be a little follow
-
through to next, that's fine.
 
Jona
than Pruzan
 
No, it came at the end of the second 
--
 
I think we raised rates either June 30 
or July 1. So we did see the full impact of the BDP rate. We didn't see the 
full impact of sort of the incremental deposits because those were raised 
over the 
second and third quarter.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
I see, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. As far as shifting gears to MiFID, 
when you guys think about MiFID coming here in the capital markets 
businesses, how are you thinking this is going to impact your European 
b
usiness next year? And when you think about balancing not only the 
payment for research but also the enhanced liquidity throughout European 
trading operations, how do you manage the potential impact of spreads 
through that enhanced transparency? And how do
 
you intend to 
--
 
how do 
you think about sizing that potential impact?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, a couple different components there. Number one, we are the #1 
equities business globally with a sort of 
--
 
with an integrated platform and a 
leading research prod
uct. MiFID has been coming for a while. And we've 
been actively engaged with our clients discussing this change. Those 
conversations are obviously very unique based on usage and needs of our 
individual clients. But those conversations have been constructiv
e and 
ongoing. And we've also been investing in the platforms and the 
infrastructure to be in compliance. In terms of how it impacts the market, 
remember, we have, give or take, an $8 billion Equity business. This is a 
smaller component of that business. W
e have an integrated platform and 
provide value
-
added services through intellectual capital access, liquidity and 
whatnot. And we've approached our Sales & Trading clients holistically.
 
So it will have an impact. Trying to measure that is sort of hard at t
his point. 
Our sense is, it's going to be a little bumpy because it's not clear that 
everyone is going to be ready for the switchover in January 3. But we would 
expect it, a, to be manageable; and b, potentially longer term as the #1 
player in this space, 
if people do consolidate trading with counterparties, we 
would expect to be the beneficiary of that. So overall, a change, but we 
adapt to change all the time. We think it's manageable. And it has the 
potential to accrue to our benefit.
 
Operator
 
[Operator 
Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn 
Schorr with Evercore ISI.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Just maybe an update. In Wealth Management, in the past, you've provided 
statistics on, I guess, the last time you showed it, 100% of days in the year,
 
you earn between $50 million and $70 million. Is that still the right range? Is 
the range rising as 
--
 
interest rates as you go more fee
-
based and the 
markets go up? And then while I'm getting greedy, if you might update us 
on what percentage of assets ar
e in the $1 million and above camp inside 
Wealth Management?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Wow, those are pretty technical questions. I think still good. How about still 
good. Lots of stability in this business and good tailwinds. Obviously, the 
total revenues generated
 
are increasing. But I still feel like it's in that range 
in terms of a good indicator on a daily basis. The nice thing about this 
business is not only the stability and the growth dynamic, but we've got 
some nice tailwinds behind it. Also if you look at t
he fee
-
based accounts and 
the fee
-
based revenues, it's now over 50% of the revenues in that business 
this quarter. So again, lots of stability and lots of continued operating 
--
 
opportunity for operating leverage going forward. The general shape and 
charac
teristics of the business are pretty stable.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
And maybe a question on the margins inside Wealth Management, obviously 
a big number this quarter. As interest income becomes a bigger part, as 
your deposit programs take hold, I mean, obviously mar
kets go up and 
down. But you're managing cost there. You have another 150 basis point of 
benefit coming in a little more than a year. Do you think pretax margins can 
consistently grind higher? And is there any natural ceiling there?
 
James Gorman
 
I guess, t
hat's sort of the early question around, ""Are we going to change 
our margin targets or whatever?"" Listen, the incremental dollar revenue is 
coming on with an incremental higher margin than the embedded margin. 
So in theory, absolutely they grind higher. In
 
practice though, we've got to 
look at 
--
 
we're also focused on growth. And what the management team in 
that business is doing is looking for ways in which we can drive further 
growth over the next several years rather than trying to grind out a 
particular
 
margin in a particular quarter. But you're right. The math suggests 
with what's happening with retention deals coming off and what's happening 
with interest rates, margin should grind higher. But again, I'm as much 
--
 
more focused frankly on total growth 
than I am on the incremental margin in 
a given quarter.
 
Operator
 
And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo 
Securities.
 
Michael Mayo
 
Can you hear me?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, we can, Mike.
 
Michael Mayo
 
Okay. So your U.S. bank deposit
s are back to $154 billion and that's almost 
the size of the 11th largest bank. And I know this is a new realm for you 
guys, but what is your deposit beta on those $154 billion of deposits? And 
what I'm really trying to get to is the first couple questions
, what should we 
expect in the future? What do you have planned as far as future CD 
campaigns or a little bit more on your strategy?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. That's a great question, Mike. Let me just step back for a minute and 
just sort of talk about NII mor
e globally or at the top of the house. We have 
seen really good growth in that line item. Year
-
to
-
date, we're up just under 
$500 million. Some of that is on an increase in the lending balances. We're 
up about $6 billion or $7 billion. Some of that is based
 
on the beta concept. 
As I've just mentioned, we've had 4 rate hikes over 2 years. This was the 
first time we raised our BDP rate. We raised it, on average, about 6 basis 
points. So on the last hike, the 6 over 25% would suggest a 25% beta. 
Based on histor
ical behavior and our model suggests closer to a 50% beta is 
the right number to look at going forward. But we're in a new environment 
of, a, rising rates; b, we've seen money market reform; c, there's been a lot 
of changes in technology and how people sav
e money.
 
So I would say that, to date, we've outperformed the beta assumption. But 
we still think that 50%
-
ish is the right way to think about it going forward. 
That also being said, as rates get higher, betas get higher, as you know. In 
terms of the overa
ll strategy, we are getting more mature in this business 
and in our liability structure. We have sort of made it through, if you will, the 
excess liquidity position. We still have some, given that we've just raised the 
deposit number from the $144 billion 
to $154 billion, we do have excess 
liquidity today to continue to fund lending growth going forward. But we're 
going to have a mix of products that support future lending growth.
 
We still feel good about the lending opportunity within our wealth client 
seg
ment. Penetration rates are still reasonably limited. And we've seen 
opportunities to continue to increase penetration there. And the funding will 
be a mix of all of the liabilities that I talked about earlier. We do 
--
 
we would 
like to continue to build o
ut this cash management engaged initiative, which 
should bring in savings deposits, some mix. We raised about, give or take, a 
couple billion dollars in savings this quarter, probably $5 billion or $6 billion 
of CDs. That's both within the network and exte
rnally; and then a couple 
--
 
some incremental wholesale liabilities. So again, we have plenty of access to 
liabilities. BDP will be and will continue to be our primary product and our 
biggest contributor. But this is a day that we have expected for a long 
time 
and have sort of been building out the capabilities in advance of it.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura 
Instinet.
 
Steven Chubak
 
I had a question on Wealth Management as well, but just actually on the 
fee 
income side of the equation. So as we think about some of the fee income 
tailwinds outside of higher markets, one of the biggest ones that you've 
spoken to is the continued pace of conversions from brokerage to fee
-
based. 
We certainly saw that, that be
nefited results this quarter. And especially in 
light of DOL implementation likely to be delayed and potentially tabled, how 
should we think about the pace of fee
-
based conversions from here as that 
seemed to provide a nice tailwind to some of the accelera
tion that we saw in 
recent quarters?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. Listen, the year
-
to
-
date flows have been very strong and they've not 
been solely driven by DOL. A significant amount of the conversions this 
quarter came from non
-
retirement accounts. So while I th
ink the DOL 
implementation or the original implementation did form a catalyst for some 
conversions, it's not been the primary driver, number one. Number two, as 
we continue to build out the goals
-
based platform, as we continue to build 
out digital and our 
other services, I think our clients are attracted to the 
value
-
added proposition of a managed account and we see that trend 
continuing. It's been a nice tailwind, as you say. And we'll see the benefits of 
that going forward. As you know, there's a lag betw
een the fees and the 
flows. But it's been really quite positive and diversified, not only driven by 
retirement accounts.
 
Steven Chubak
 
And maybe a broader question on how you're thinking about capital 
management and some strategic growth initiatives. And o
ne of the things 
that comes up quite often in discussions is that, as we look at the various 
capital constraints, you're much more leveraged than risk
-
based constrained 
than many of your peers. And as you think about potential opportunities to 
either bette
r optimize your capital base or 
--
 
and even consider or 
demonstrate some willingness to explore inorganic growth opportunities, are 
you open to expanding into areas that are maybe more risk
-
intensive and 
which could potentially help you optimize against so
me of your more 
constraining capital ratios such as leverage?
 
James Gorman
 
Steve, it's James. I think that's a much broader discussion than we'd 
probably do justice on an earnings call. We've worked very hard in the last 
several years to get ourselves in a
 
position where our buyback and dividend 
combined generated close to 100% payout. We still believe we're carrying 
significant excess capital. And you're right, at this point in time, the leverage 
ratio has been the constrained at least the last couple of C
CARs. Now 
whether that continues remains to be seen. I think the team, we're acutely 
conscious of risk
-
based capital, leverage
-
based capital tradeoffs. I think 
we've started, as evidenced by the Mesa West transaction, to show that 
we're not shy about doing
 
inorganic things where they make sense. We're 
not interested in particularly making a splash on that front.
 
We like businesses where we have real scale advantages. That's where we're 
aggressive. And Wealth Management was the example on that. But 
otherwise
, they tend to be inorganic, should be much more tactical, I would 
think, in general. So it's a much longer discussion. But at this point, we'd 
like to continue 
--
 
we have a lot of shares outstanding. We've got our 
dividend to $1 a share on an annual basis
. We like to continue to pursue the 
buyback dividend strategy and excess capital. Once we see more clarity 
around the regulatory framework, if and when we see we have more excess 
capital, then we'll put that to work either inorganically or with further 
buy
backs or indeed against some of the risk
-
based businesses that we're in.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with 
Autonomous Research.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
You alluded, Jon, a little bit to targets for Wealth Management lending 
g
rowth and kind of the headroom that you see. I was hoping that maybe you 
could give us a little bit more of a quantitative sense for how you assess 
your penetration versus competitors, client appetite and, therefore, sort of 
what you see as a headroom for 
prudent lending.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, again, I would say that we've seen continued growth in the lending 
product across Wealth Management across the 3 products, mortgage,

based loans and tailored product. In '16, that was $10 billion. To 
date, 
it's been about $7 billion. We've seen good loan production across all 3 
channels 
--
 
or excuse me, all 3 products. We did see some big payoffs at the 
end of the quarter that muted our total balances outstanding this quarter. 
But we continue to see real rec
eptivity within the wealth client network for 
these products. We're continually designing products that we think that fit 
within the footprint. Based on market data, it suggests that our penetration 
rates are lower than some others, so we think that we con
tinue to have 
room both on the SBL and on the mortgage product. And we've seen 
consistent production over the last several years. So it sort of gives us 
confidence that we will continue to be able to grow those balances going 
forward.
 
James Gorman
 
The othe
r thing I'd just add about 
--
 
strategically about that business is the 
lending side provides a lot of stickiness with the relationships. So I was on a 
phone call with a client yesterday. His adviser left to a competitive firm, a 
multi
-
hundred million dolla
r relationship. We have a significant loan out to 
that client. And the client has no interest in moving because they like the 
loan that we have. They like the funding they're getting from that. They 
--
 
in 
fact, after the call, he said they were likely to i
ncrease their assets here. So 
that stickiness for the high end is a big deal. These markets go in cycles as 
we all know. And people want access to credit. They have large illiquid 
positions, so concentrated stock in businesses they founded, and they don't 
necessarily want to liquidate that. And we're in a position where we're 
dealing with a lot of very, very wealthy people. I think 2% of our assets with 
clients with less than $100,000 with us. So the vast majority have significant 
wealth. And it's a real co
mpetitive advantage now to be able to compete 
with the banks and offer these lending products.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
That's a good point. Follow
-
up question, just on targets again. You were 
asked the one about Wealth Management margin targets, but what about 
fixe
d? Given that in what was clearly a very challenging quarter, you well 
exceeded that $1 billion quarterly level. Any potential movement on your 
goal there?
 
James Gorman
 
Guy, when we set the targets, it was the beginning of 2016 for 2017. And 
we said we'd l
ike to see 4 things happen, an ROE range of 9% to 11% in 
2017. We've hit that each quarter; efficiency ratio driven by Project 
Streamline of 74% expense to revenue, and we've been below that for the 3 
quarters; Wealth Management margin, 23% to 25%, and we'
re now 
operating above that level; and the fourth, of course, was the Fixed Income 
division's revenues, which we thought, given what the team did with the 
restructuring in the fourth quarter '15, I think it was, we thought that the 
business model stood on 
its own with about $1 billion in revenue. That 
wasn't obviously an aspirational performance. But we thought that's what it 
should do. And recall, we've had a couple of quarters around $500 million, 
$600 million.
 
First quarter of '16, I think we did about $
800 million and change. And since 
then, we've had, what's that, 6 quarters of consecutive $1 billion
-
plus. It's 
actually probably average. I haven't look at the numbers, but my guess is 
it's averaged $1.25 billion over that time. So clearly, we exceeded th
e $1 
billion. I don't know. We'll think through the end of the year. I don't think 
there's a lot of point in trying to nail ourselves to a specific revenue target 
for a business as volatile as that. I haven't seen our competitors do that. 
What we wanted to
 
do was say we want it full
-
blown minimum. It's not sort 
of a race to 
--
 
we could drive revenues in that business harder, but we'd use 
more balance sheet and we wouldn't necessarily have the same risk profile 
we've got, so there are tradeoffs in it. And at
 
this point, we're really happy 
with what the team has done. I think they've done a terrific job.
 
They've taken a business that was really on its heels. And it's clearly become 
competitive on a global basis. It will never have the macro businesses of the 
b
ig banks, but it's really performing well across the franchise. So I doubt 
you're going to see new targets in that. I just don't see a lot of upside for 
that. And I don't think people can sensibly predict revenue outlooks for 
something that volatile, but w
hat we did seek to was a minimum revenue 
number. And let's get through the end of this year, we've got another 
quarter to go.

And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Matthew O'Connor
 
You guys had touched on efficiency a couple of times, and specifically Wealth 
Management. But I guess, just to circle back, from a firm
-
wide point of view, 
how much more opportunity is there? I guess I step back and I think that 
your businesses are higher 
expense
-
based in general, but you also have 
leading market shares in a lot of what you do, have been executing well, as 
you pointed out, in getting the efficiency ratio down, you're exceeding your 
plan this year. But just how much more opportunity is there
 
for maybe 
continued low
-
hanging fruit in the back office or within the institutional 
business?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, I don't think there's a lot of 
--
 
Jon will comment on this, but I don't 
think there's a lot of low
-
hanging fruit. I mean, we've been at 
this for a few 
years. So I think we have a pretty good handle on our expenses. The 
primary driver is, of course, the compensation expense. And I think, the 
ranges we have given in each of the businesses make sense. I think, our ISG 
comp ratio this quarter 
was around 35%. Wealth Management is obviously 
higher because of the payout structure in that business, but it's been 
grinding lower over time as non
-
compensable revenues come onstream. And 
the Investment Management businesses tend to come out around the 4
0%, 
42%, 44%, somewhere in that range. So that's a number that honestly is 
more a function of what the revenues are. The non
-
comp expenses, we have 
held pretty tight, in fact, extremely.
 
And we've taken, I think, the obvious low
-
hanging fruit off the table
. But as 
you point out, these businesses are scale businesses. The non
-
comp 
expenses in Wealth Management, I think, Jon, were down a little bit this 
quarter on significantly higher revenues. And in the institutional businesses, 
there's a lot been going on 
with CCAR and resolution planning that has 
added expenses. We had the resubmission of CCAR last year. We had the 
British VAT tax issue, which hit the non
-
comps. We're still grinding through 
the last of the litigation from the crisis that you see pop along 
in little dribs 
and drabs every quarter. And we're increasing our spend, as you would want 
us to do, on cybersecurity. We're making big investments in digital.
 
We're driving a lot of electronic transformation within the institutional 
business. So there are
 
areas where we're investing in the platform because 
we want to build a Morgan Stanley of the next 5 to 10 years, not the last 5 
years. So short answer is, I think, low
-
hanging fruit, we have pretty much 
picked up. Scale in the businesses really matters. T
hat's why you saw, I 
think, with a 9% year
-
over
-
year revenue, it was something like 15% to 18% 
pretax increase. And we're trading off sensible investments for long
-
term 
growth versus short
-
term fill
-
ups. And I think what you're going to see with 
every $1 o
f incremental revenue, you will still see a higher incremental 
margin coming on even with those investments. Jon, is there anything I 
missed there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. No, I think you've hit it. I think we continue 
--
 
if you just look at the 
non
-
comp line
, we continue to try to make progress on there. If you recall, 
when we came out with our targets at the beginning of '16, we didn't really 
expect the incremental CCAR that we got from the resubmission. Brexit 
wasn't on the table. So there are things that p
op up all over the place that 
sort of cause that business 
--
 
cause those expenses to move around a little 
bit. But again, on an incremental basis, we've shown some really nice 
discipline and trends in both the areas that we can really control. We have 
seen
 
a little bit of an uptick in the BC&E and transaction taxes as our 
strength in outside of the U.S. has continued to grow. So Europe and Asia 
generally come with higher expenses in the Sales & Trading businesses. But 
our hope is that we'll continue to main
tain the discipline. Maybe some of the 
investments that we're making around automation will lead to better 
efficiency that might be able to bring down the unit cost a little bit more. But 
I would agree with James that sort of the low
-
hanging fruit is sort 
of 
--
 
we've sort of taken that out already.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
I apologize if you've addressed this already, but as an Advanced Approach 
bank, could you tell us what your LCR ratio,
 
liquidity coverage ratio, was this 
quarter? And where do you hope to manage that to?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Our LCR for the second quarter was in the high 120s. We would expect it to 
maintain that level or it has maintained that level. It's going to bounce 
aroun
d a little bit. But clearly, the 100% limitation is not a binding constraint 
for us at all within the liquidity 
--
 
within our liquidity framework. So again, 
it's not 
--
 
it hasn't been a constraint for us. I don't expect it to be one in 
terms of the managem
ent of our liquidity. We look at our stress tests and 
resolution and all the different analysis that we do. And it has generally not 
been a binding constraint for either 
--
 
for the institution.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Great. Subsequent to your second quarter call, 
obviously the Treasury came 
out in October with their new white paper on their views of where the 
changes in the capital market regulations should head. Can you guys give us 
some color on 1 or 2 of the regulations that's most important to Morgan 
Stanley th
at you'd like to see changed?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, again, specifically to the October white paper, it was really around the 
capital markets. I think we're broadly supportive. It was a very large and 
dense document. Anything that improves the liquidity of 
markets would be a 
positive. Anything that reduces the unnecessary administrative burden 
would be a positive. Anything that reduces complexity around the 
implementation or the compliance with the regulations would be a positive. 
Generally, the tone, broadl
y speaking, has been positive. It's been around 
recalibration and simplification. And so whether you're talking about Volcker 
or CCAR or the SLR resolution, which was generally the topics that get 
discussed, anything that would simplify those, anything tha
t would reduce 
the complexity and the overlapping nature would be positive. We think the 
tone, at least from the Fed right now, has been around that simplification 
process. And we'll see what and if anything gets done over time as people 
get into their sea
ts and their new jobs.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.
 
Alevizos Alevizakos
 
I've got a broad question. Since you mentioned that a lot of your clients 
moved their money out of deposits and into active products, 
I'm wondering 
whether the percentage of your IB revenues have actually increased. And 
my main question is basically, since Wealth Management is presumably the 
largest client in the Investment Banking, what is the percent of the total IB 
revenues that are g
enerated and actually belong effectively to the Wealth 
Management division?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'm not sure I follow the question so much, so let me just take a stab at 
what I think you're getting at. In terms of what we've seen in sort of the 
wealth network,
 
the total sort of cash and money market and cash 
equivalent balances are down at sort of near
-
time lows. So it's not only 
deposits that people have been deploying into the markets, it's just sort of 
all their 
--
 
it's sort of all the cash and cash equivale
nt categories. There are 
clear synergies between our wealth business and our institutional 
businesses. But in terms of the amount of revenue that goes back and forth, 
I think that's an area that we think the businesses are complementary and 
they benefit ea
ch other, but we don't 
--
 
I wouldn't describe it in terms of the 
ways that you have. Clearly, having that distribution arm is good for a new 
issue product. It's good for certain structured products. So we continue to 
develop products that our wealth client
s want. But again, the businesses are 
complementary and we don't measure it like that.
 
Alevizos Alevizakos
 
Sure. And as a follow
-
up question. At the moment, what are the 3 top 
products that you would say that your wealthy clients are getting out of your 
In
vestment Banking franchise?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, our clients 
--
 
we have an open platform. Our clients have access to 
products across all of the different investment opportunities. Clearly, some 
of our clients like the new issue product. As I said, we saw
 
a lot of 
engagement with our clients with the cash and money market balances 
going down. And it looks like the proportion of invested assets and equities 
went up across the platform, so broadly speaking, equity product. They 
enjoy 
--
 
also there's structur
ed products that some of the segments enjoy in 
terms of products that are tied to indices and other markets or other indexes 
or other rates around the world. But again, it's an open platform. It's a full
-
service platform. It is integrated with our institut
ional business, so there are 
some complementary 
--
 
complementarity to it. But again, I wouldn't 
describe it as the way you're describing it.
 
Operator
 
And our last question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Maybe first one 
here, just within GWM, obviously a lot in the mix on the 
technology front with the robo platform and some of the goals
-
based 
technology being rolled out, which hopefully should attract new clients and 
expand the wall with existing clients. So can you remin
d us on the timing of 
maybe some of the key initiatives there? And then, just as digital becomes a 
bigger theme, I think, for the industry, how does Morgan Stanley think 
about when it's appropriate to build something that's proprietary versus 
partnering wi
th outside FinTech?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
A couple different things. I would say, one, that sort of the digital strategy 
and the digital product rollout, I would say, broadly is on schedule. We're in 
beta testing with some of the products right now and are going
 
to go out to 
the full network soon. So I would say, our investments around product are 
on schedule. When we think about digital, it's obviously a very important 
component to the overall franchise, but there's 2 components. There's a 
revenue component as w
ell as an efficiency and automation component. I 
would suggest that a lot of the investments that we're making are going to 
help with the automation and efficiency of our branch network, which should 
lead to again better operating leverage in the business 
upfront and will also 
save time with our FAs and our CSAs, so they'll have more ability to spend 
time with clients.
 
But again, when we think about our wealth business, it's a business that's 
built on scale. And it's built on the fact that people with wealt
h want 
personal advice. So it's going to be both a mix of technology and digital with 
the personal element of the advice channel. And we think that's the winning 
formula going forward. But digital is important. It's on track. I would say the 
impact to the 
financial results are going to lag those investments. We'll see 
it probably first on the expense side and then later on the revenue side.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Yes. Got it, okay. Good color there. And then just follow
-
up here, maybe one 
around FIC and just bigger pic
ture. When rates were low, I know many 
thought that as rates started to move, clients would increasingly reposition 
portfolios, so that would drive higher trading volumes. And I know you've 
spoken in the past around kind of Prime Brokerage client leverage.
 
I'm sure 
it's still low. Are you seeing anything structurally holding back client risk
-
taking? Or do you just feel like it's simply just not enough buy
-
in on this 
market or the economic growth outlook? Just trying to think about kind of if 
there's somethi
ng else structurally that's maybe within the leverage levels.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen, I don't think it's structural. We've seen low volatility across many 
asset classes. We've seen a lack of sort of idiosyncratic events. When there 
is uncertainty, in some 
ways, that's 
--
 
or differences of opinions, that 
generates trading activity. We haven't seen a lot of that more recently. I 
think the underlying fundamentals sort of the global recovery, if you will, are 
pretty positive. But we haven't seen real dramatic c
hanges in the rate 
profile. The 10
-
year treasury rebounded a little bit here recently. But given 
the geopolitical risk and the persistently low inflation numbers, it's a pretty 
tight trading band, FX rates, tight trading band, credit spreads, tight trading
 
band. So again, I don't think it's structural. I think it's cyclical at this point. 
At some point, there will be catalysts to change the direction of the trading 
environment, and whether that's tax policy, whether that's better inflation 
data. But there w
ill be something. And so this has been a sort of a subdued 
environment. I don't think it persists forever. But when and how that 
catalyst appears is clearly a question mark.

James Gorman
 
Thank 
you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Given the amount of 

a few minutes as needed to insure you get your questions in. In a minute, 

d plan, but before I do so let 
me touch briefly on the fourth quarter.
 
Clearly the difficult environment that began midsummer continued through 
the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, equity sales and trading and 
Investment Banking were strong, and Wealt
h Management and Investment 
Management were solid. We acted on those things within our control by 
initiating a major restructuring affect, conducting a large reduction in force 
in December, reducing our compensation
-
to
-
revenue ratio, launching a large 
scal
e firm
-
wide expense initiative, more on that later, significantly reducing 
RWAs impact to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion, and 
closing the sale of our oil merchanting business.
 
Finally, we put in place the leadership team to drive the t
eam forward over 
the next several years. On that, I look forward to having Colm join me as 
our President. He brings highly complimentary skills and will help take this 
firm to the next level. The previous appointments of Ted Pick as Global Head 
of Sales an
d Trading, Dan Simkowitz as Head of Investment Management 
and Jon Pruzan as CFO are hard evidence of our deep and talented bench.
 
Finally, Sam Kellie
-
Smith, will run fixed income and commodities working for 
Ted. In light of these changes, it was expected t
hat Greg Fleming would 
pursue opportunities away from Morgan Stanley. We thank Greg for all he is 
done, and wish him well for the future. Our bench in Wealth Management is 

years experie
nce in that business.
 
Shelley previously ran the field organization, a position Andy also previously 
held as well as running products. Colm will help oversee Wealth Management 
and of course it is a business have a very long history in. Building a first
-
cla

delighted we made these decisions, and look forward to a period of stability 
with this team. Now our entire focus is on driving results.
 
Please, if you will, turn to the slides that you ca
n find on the Investor 
Relations website. After I go through these Jon will take you through the 

Slide number 3. As you can see, as a result of many changes, our business 
mix is m
uch more balanced with complimentary franchises in Institutional 
Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management.
 
In our Institutional Securities business, we have maintained our leadership 
positions in Investment Banking and equity sales and trad
ing, as illustrated 

the third quarter year
-
to
-

under the leadership of Colm and Ted, with full year revenues ex
-
DVA of 
$8.1 billi
on, up 18% year
-
over
-
year. In banking, we continue to see 
strength and finished second in global announced M&A and number one in 
IPOs.
 
Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results. In Wealth 
Management, we achieved a full
-
year profit margin of
 
22%, with pre
-
tax 
earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business. We expect to see further 

by 46% year
-
over
-
year in a flat rate environment. However in fixed income 
and commodi
ties, we failed to improve on our financial results.
 

shrinking revenue pool coupled with the steady increase in capital 
requirements led us to take further significant action at year end.
 
Through 
our recently announced FIC restructuring, we will better align the capital and 
resources committed to the business with the opportunity we see. Through 
the year, our funding costs benefited from the realization of our funding 
tailwind, as the debt
 
we issued was at much tighter spreads than the post
-
crisis debt that matured. We will continue to see benefit from the associated 
going forward.
 
We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full
-
year 
ISG compensation ratio ex
-
DVA of 37%, b
elow our stated goal of 39% or 
less. And finally, we increased our common dividend by 50% and increased 
our buyback from $1 billion to $2.5 billion. We intend to further increase 
capital return to shareholders in the years ahead, subject of course to 
regul
atory approval. As you can on page 6, our ROE for 2015 excluding DVA 
and the discrete tax benefits were 7% on a capital base of $67 billion. We 
remain committed to our 10% ROE target. Obviously that gap is a function 
of both earnings and equity.
 
On Slide 7
 
we layout the key elements of our plan for achieving returns of 
10% or greater. These include capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth 
Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders. These of 
course are in addition to the continued i
mprovements across Institutional 
Securities and Investment Management. Since 2012, we have made 
significant progress in derisking our balance sheet on flat assets. This is 
shown on Slide 8. We continued to accrete common equity, despite 
continued increase 
in capital returns to shareholders. We believe our robust 
equity base coupled with a derisk balance sheet and a transformed business 
mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan.
 
As shown on Slide 9, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 rati
o of 14.1% 
and pro forma supplemental leverage ratio of 5.8% are well in excess of 
their prospective requirements. Building a very strong capital base has been 
a critical part of our strategy, as evidenced by our ratios. By comparison in 
the first quarter 
of 2014, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio under 
the advanced approach was 11.6% and our pro forma supplemental 
leverage ratio was just 4.2%. We await clarification on the impact in timing 
of the G
-
SIB buffer and CCAR. When that clarity is provided,
 
we believe we 
will be near the end of supervisory changes and therefore our capital is 
appropriately sized to support our business going forward.
 
Turning to fixed income and commodities on Slide 10. Notwithstanding 
considerable efforts to reduce the capit
al required to support FIC, further 
regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led 
us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary. We have reset 
the long
-
term RWA target for FIC at $110 billion, and a setting an S
LR 
exposure target of $250 billion. As a result, we are confident that going 
forward this business will require $5 billion to $8 billion less capital. Over 
time where possible, excess capital will be returned to shareholders.
 
On Slide 11, we give more deta
ils on the FIC restructuring. Given the 
cyclical, and in some cases structural challenges facing fixed income, driven 
by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision 
to downside headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sh
eet and 
capital focus. We took this action alongside the recent installation of a new 
management team with the objective of credibly sizing of the business going 
forward.
 
Our emphasis will be where we have traditional strengths. We have 
competitive advanta
ges in micro products, specifically in corporate credit 
connecting to our Investment Banking franchise, as well as the mortgage 
product and in macro product such as structured rates, and certain 
electronified FX product, which we will appropriately resourc
e. Even closer 
integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities, and in 
partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base, will allow 
us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet.
 

discipline, beginning on Slide 12. As a 
management team, our number priority is to control what we can control 
given market realities. In ISG, we previously set our compensation target of 
39%, and finished the year at approximately 37%, partly a function o
f 
having fewer employees to support the business. We intend to stay at or 
below 37% in ISG and have also said 2017 targets for Wealth Management 
and Investment Management.
 
Turning to Slide 13. In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we 
have la
unched a major company
-
wide initiative called Project Streamline, an 
effort lead by our CFO Jon Pruzan, and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is 
designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense 
reductions by the end of 2017. Some of these initi
atives are shown here.
 
Now is the time to tackle head
-
on our infrastructure costs and maximize 
low
-
cost deployment of talent. We have too many legal entities, too much 
duplication of operations and processes, and too many employees based in 
high
-
cost cente
rs doing work that can sensibly be done in lower cost centers. 
You will hear a lot more about Project Streamline in the coming quarters.
 
The combination of these efforts will enable us to meaningfully improve our 
efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 14. Our 
target expense ratio ex
-
DVA in 
2015 was 79% and we ended the year 77%. Expense management is 
critically important. As such we have set a net target ratio of 74% in 2017, 
which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next two 
years.
 
In set
ting this efficiency ratio, we have assumed flat revenues for 2016 and 
2017. To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, 
especially given ongoing growth initiatives like Lending and Wealth 
Management; however, we believe this assumption
 
is appropriately 
conservative.
 

high quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base. We have 
significantly reduced client penetration and increase client penetration in 
se
curity space lending and residential lending over the last three years, but 
we remain substantially underpenetrated relative to our peers.
 
For example, only 1.9% of our clients have a mortgage loan through Morgan 
Stanley. Increased penetration of all loans
 
will drive $20 billion of lending 
growth through 2017. A highly scalable business like Wealth Management 
enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such 
as net interest growth.
 
Slide 16 aggregates the medium
-
term opportunities in
 
Wealth Management. 
To provide granularity, we lay out three areas where we see obvious 

level of 22%, we see margin potential of 23% to 25% in 2017 through one 
loan and deposit growth, t
wo expense discipline, and three normal course of 
business growth.
 

Smith Barney transaction, we put in place a retention program that 
amortized over nine years. That amortization will b
e completed in January 
2019 and will add an additional 150 basis points of margin.
 

sufficiently capitalized. Subject to regulatory approval, we intend to increase 
our payout to sharehold
ers in the coming years just as we have done in the 
last four years. Let me now turn to Slide 18, the final slide. This sets forth 
ROE targets for 2017.
 
Over the past several years, our returns have been depressed by very high 
litigation expenses in 
penalties. The need to build a strong capital base 
resulting in material capital growth every year. The cost of integration of the 
largest acquisition in wealth management history. The challenging fixed 

apital levels. The 
restructuring of our merchant bank and of course the enormous cost in 
capital brought about by the post
-
crisis regulatory environment.
 

billion of tangible expense sa
vings. We believe the bank strategy will be a 
significant driver of earnings growth in wealth management and for the firm. 
We expect equities and IBD to remain strong and grow revenues assuming 
global economic growth.
 
And we believe Investment Management i
s now positioned for growth. Most 
importantly we believe our capital is strong and our ongoing balance sheet 
reductions will free up more capital for distribution or where that is not 
possible, reinvestment into our high return businesses.
 

re setting a 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. This assumes no 
material new capital requirements, no outside new litigation expenses or 
penalties and a global economy, that evidences growth not turmoil. Either 
way, in a flat revenue environment, we will reduce
 
run
-
rate expenses by $1 
billion on an annual basis beginning in 2017.
 

together we would take all of your questions.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Thanks, James. Good morning. I will keep my comments br
ief, so we have 
ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation 
of the third quarter in many ways with mid
-
quarter volatility and macro 
concerns driving clients to the side lines after relatively constructive markets 
early in the
 
quarter.
 
In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our equities, 
investment banking and wealth management businesses. Against this 
backdrop, revenues were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or $7.9 billion 
excluding DVA, up 7% versus 3
Q 2015.
 
Non
-
interest expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion. Our effective tax 
rate was 34.5% for the quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings 
throughout the year. For the full year 2015, our tax rate excluding the 
discrete tax benefits from t
he first quarter was 32.5%.
 
Now to the businesses. In a challenging environment for some of our 
institutional security business, overall revenues ex
-
DVA were $3.5 billion, up 
2% quarter
-
on
-
quarter. Non
-
interest expense was down 11% versus the 
third quarter
. Compensation expenses were $1.2 billion down 7% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was down for the 
quarter, which brought our full year ratio to 37%. Non
-
compensation 
expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13% driv
en by lower 
litigation costs.
 
In investment banking, continued strength in our M&A business and better 
performance in equity underwriting helped to offset weakness in debt 
underwriting. For the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in revenues up 3% 
sequentia
lly. Advisory revenues for the quarter were strong at $516 million, 
but down 7% from the post 2008 high we achieved last quarter.
 
Turning to underwriting, equity underwriting revenues were $352 million up 
41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting 
increases in IPOs. We 
continued to see pressure from volatility in fixed income underwriting 
volumes and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, 
driven by decreases in loan fees partially offset by investment grade bond 
fees.
 
The four
th quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year 
in equity sales and trading as clients remained active and we delivered 
across products and regions in a volatile market. Ex
-
DVA, revenues for the 
quarter were $1.8 billion up 3% sequentia
lly. For the quarter, cash equity 
revenues were higher versus comparable quarters, as we gained share 
across regions.
 
Our prime brokerage business continued to demonstrate leadership, with 
revenues up quarter
-
over
-
quarter as we stayed closely engaged with 
our 
clients. Derivative revenues were down quarter
-
over
-
quarter against 
challenging market conditions but up year
-
over
-
year.
 
Fixed income and commodity sales and trading continue to under
-
perform in 
a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening
 
in various products 
and lower levels of client activity. For the quarter revenues were $550 
million, excluding DVA, down 6% versus the third quarter. Revenues in 
securitized products and credit continued to be negatively impacted by the 
environment.
 
Rates
 
revenues in the quarter were up sequentially, while FX was down 
driven by lower market volatility and lower client engagement. Commodity 
results were down quarter
-
over
-
quarter, primarily driven by our oil 
merchanting business. We closed the sale of this b
usiness on November 1. 
Given the sale of our two large physical oil businesses, we would expect to 
see less seasonality in our first quarter FIC results going forward.
 
Lastly, average trading VaR for the quarter was $46 million, down from $53 
million last 
quarter, driven by a reduction in interest rates and credits spread 
as well as commodities.
 
In our wealth management business, we continue to see steadiness, for the 
quarter and for the full
-
year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of 
approximately $60 m
illion with no day below $50 million.
 
Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, excluding the impact of differed 
compensation plan investments in both periods revenues were 
approximately flat sequentially. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from 
our
 
deposit deployment strategy with net interest income increasing 4% 
from fourth 

 
third quarter and full
-
year net interest income of $3 billion up 
26%.
 
Funded lending balances in wealth management grew approximately $3 
billion or 6% during the quarter and 
$12 billion or 31% year
-
over
-
year. 

5% decline in asset management revenues, which was a function of the third 

 
transactional revenues, excluding the impact of DCP.
 
On the expense side, compensation was up 6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter due 
largely to the offsetting impact of the expense associated with DCP 
investment James mentioned earlier. Non
-
compensation expenses wer
e up 
6% driven by typical 4Q seasonality. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 
21% ex
-
severance down slightly versus 3Q 2015 though up year on year. 
For the full
-
year, PBT margin was 22% in wealth management.
 
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $149 bi
llion at year
-
end up $10 
billion versus the third quarter reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as 

 
And in Investment Management revenues were $621 million up significantly 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter drive
n by traditional asset management, which was up 
5% as well as stronger performance in merchant banking and real estate 
investing, where revenues were $211 million versus a loss in the third 
quarter.
 
Performance in Investment Management will be impacted by 
the market 
levels and back drop. So far this quarter market industries around globe are 
down with many off to their worse start in history. If they remain down 
through the rest of the quarter we will see an impact in Investment 
Management performance, part
icular in our private investing businesses.
 
Now turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $788 billion at 
December 31 down from $834 billion at the end of the third quarter. 
Average balance sheet was $814 billion down from $827 billion in 3Q as 
clien
ts moved to the sidelines and activity slowed, particular in the second 
half of the quarter.
 
Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion, 
compared with a $191 billion at the end of the third quarter driven by typical 
seasonality
 
in deposits. Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs 
are expected to be approximately $397 billion, down from $434 billion in the 
third quarter driven by reductions in market RWAs in a slower client 
environment.
 
During the fourth quarter, we rep
urchased $625 million of common stock or 
approximately 19 million shares, and our Board declared a $0.15 dividend 
per share. For the full
-
year, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock or 
59 million shares.
 
Turning to outlook, in the first two weeks, we
 
have seen a significant rise in 
volatility across market and asset classes and an intense focus on the China 
economy, market and currency as well as declining oil prices. We have had a 
reasonable start in sales and trading, as clients have been engaged as
 
they 
try and navigate this period of volatility and keep their risk positions close to 
home.
 
M&A has remained active. We are cautious however, as prolonged volatility 
is not conducive to M&A activity. The underwriting calendar has been 

could delay new issues coming to market. And on the retail side, clients 

unfolds and we are tightly manag
ing our risk positions along with our clients.
 
With that, we will open the line to questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of

Good morning, thanks for taking the questions.
 
James Gorman
 
[Indiscernible]
 
Brennan Hawken
 

[indiscernible] RWA and FIC that you laid out in the deck. So what should we 
think abo
ut as far as timing, obviously you laid out the year
-
end 2017? But 
is there a way to think about the curve over the next two years, as we 
progress. And how should we think about the revenue that would be tied to 
that capital and how it might be recycled th
roughout the organization if not 
returned to shareholders.
 
James Gorman
 

targets, so there 

 
for I think the last three years and going back I still 
remember a number like $392 billion o
r there about in around the third 
quarter of 2011 in FIC. So we are light years from that. And last year, we 
thought we had achieved $180 billion and as you can see, we ended 
materially lower than that.
 
On the exact timing of year
-
end and the trajectory ye
ar
-



We have some natural roll off. So we feel very comfortable with these 
targets. And
 


 
As it relates to the capital with just arithmetically, if you run these numbers 
through the models, it does actually free up that much capital. It just means
 

overcapitalized that our balance sheet was too big in the business given the 
revenue and business opportunity. We now 

 
and we were over expensed 
frankly by taking out 25% of the head count 
and with that the expenses on 
compensation, the project streamline that would now work on some of the 
infrastructure pieces by now reducing the RWAs and the SLR Exposure.
 
We will reduce the amount of capital tied up in that business. How that is 
redeployed
 


of the pieces of that plan. We are a regulated institution. We have been 
through CCAR or SCAR I think five time


continue to ask for buybacks and dividends.
 

period of time which some 
of it maybe. There are clearly other businesses 
that can use the capital sensibly. We have very high return businesses in 
both Investment Management and Wealth Management. Clearly, we can use 
the capital to support our growth in those businesses. As indeed
 
we have 
had very high returns in our equity franchise.
 


given here with the instate and with the year
-
end 2
017.
 
Brennan Hawken
 

think about revenue or you could maybe help us to frame how to think about 
revenue, because obviously if you are going to take that much capital out, 
right.
 
You are going to have a very different business. You talked about 
focusing on some of the strengths a few business lines maybe you could help 
us think about which businesses you are going to be deemphasizing and how 
much revenue you think realistically co
uld come out as a result of that. And 
then finally, how that translates into margin for the business overall.
 
James Gorman
 


e, Jon may want to 

probably in the first quarter, one of the investment conferences.
 
I think the basic position we are in was we had more balance sheet and 
more capital in the busi
ness than we were generating revenues on. So we 

given where we finished 2015, which frankly as we said we are very candid 

 
of fixed 

12 and 24 months.
 


in the mor


focused on the major currencies there, not the not the non
-
G10 currencies. 
And then, regionally we sort of picked our shot
s through distressed and high 
yield in various other places around the globe where we think we need to be 
overemphasized relative to under. The net of it will be more of a U.S.
-
focused business, a slimmer business when it comes to some of the macro 
product
s.
 

 
Jon Pruzan
 
Yes, the one thing I would add is just to give you a better sense of some of 
the things we are getting out of as James mentioned, most of that is not in 
the U.S. Thin
gs like sovereign CDS, some of the non
-
core European 
currencies, Asia distressed trading, some of the bespoke [ph] correlation 

in terms of the oil merchanting businesses as well as 
the announcement 
regarding our European power and gas last year.
 
So a smaller footprint, less capital, less expenses and better margin.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay, great.
 
James Gorman
 

Brendan, 
I think, three earnings calls in a row, so my apologies.
 
Brennan Hawken
 

another one here real quick. When we think about your ROE goal, right 
ultimately which you referen
ced early on in the deck many times as 10% 
and then, we think about 2017 showing the 9% to 11%, can you maybe 

be complete by 2017. How is it we should think about that?
 
James 
Gorman
 
You know, our goal remains to achieve returns above our cost of capital. 

that for granted for the moment. Our goal is to achieve returns above that. 

at precise, I mean, this is a highly variable set of 
revenues that we have in these businesses as we are seeing in the markets 




it and as we laid out what the key drivers of that.
 

have a major outsized litigati
on expense or penalties that are unforeseen if 
the markets completely collapse here if we have no revenue growth, if the 
Fed responded very differently to our capital plans than what we intended it 
gets harder. On the other side if we have stronger revenue
 
growth, we meet 

about the range and our target is the mid point of that range.
 
Brennan Hawken
 

 
James Gorman
 
Sure.
 
Operat
or
 
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Glenn 
Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thanks very much. I guess the follow
-
up on FICC. Just curious what you 
think the net of all of the moves might be in term
s of how you think about 
your G
-
SIB buffer and then how it might factor in just in general to your 
ability to return that excess capital. I heard your comments about 

then the costs 
that go along with it is kind of what builds the buffer but just 
curious to get some detail on that.
 
James Gorman
 
In thinking about capital, I mean, problem number one is having enough 
capital. At 4.2 supplemental leverage ratio which was just I think the 


capital on any metric that you measure.
 
Problem number two is then if you continue to accrete capital what is the 

that. And then opportunity number three is as you reshape the business mix 
and move to a less capital intensive parts of the business, you by definition 
are throwing off more capital 

what are you able to do with that capital?
 


going to hav

ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years at the same 

 

 
G
-
SIB buffer, we 

through the CCAR process is adjusting its models once they put the CCAR 
buffer in my understanding is there will be adjustments to the models which 
will tamper that bu
ffer to create a net number which is lower than the buffer 

see that play out.
 
My understanding is the Federal Reserve had models which were by 
definition harder than they probably 
would have had in normal circumstance 
but that was driven by not having the G
-
SIB buffer put in place. Now that 

looking at. So the combined net impact of the G
-
SIB buffer with t
hese 
capital reductions from the balance sheet with the amount of capital we are 
a accreting, we still accrete capital last year gives us a reasonably high 

in the years ahead.
 
Gl
enn Schorr
 
From your lips, all right, just a follow
-
up on a quickie one on the corporate 
loan commitments, if you could give any color about the total or the funded 
loan book, how much of its energy reserves against that? How are you 
feeling about that boo
k in general.
 
James Gorman
 
In general, on the corporate loan book, I think, the focus areas have really 
been around energy and probably event, particularly in the single
-
B market. 
We have seen, on the energy complex we have seen credit migration in that 
po

increase in some negative marks that we take through our 

 
income 
statement, as well as increasing our hedges. And we would expect that 
pressure on that portfolio to persist for awhi
le.
 


quarter. Of that $16 billion, I would say 60% is investment grade, or excuse 

tment grade counter parties and only about 30% of that $16 
billion is funded. Another focus area within the energy portfolio has really 
been around E&P. In terms of our statistics that portfolio is about $4.4 billion 
broken down, $1.7 of that is funded to 
non
-
investment grade borrowers and 
about $2.7 billion is still unfunded. That unfunded piece is about two
-
thirds 
to investment grade borrowers.
 
In terms of the reserves and the allowances remember of the $16 billion 
total energy book 
approximately 60% of that is held for investment, while 
40% is fair value or held for sale. That other portion is mark
-
to
-
market and 
primarily flows through our other revenue line in the ISG in terms of the 
income statement and has been marked to the curre
nt environment. We will 
continue to monitor that portfolio very closely. We regularly stress test it. 


exposu
res.
 


have had a handful of loans that got caught in that dislocation and 
downdraft but again, it is only
 
a handful of loans, a few of which we 
distributed in the fourth quarter and a few of which we still hold. The losses 
related to both the syndicated loans as well as the ones that we still hold are 
also reflected in our fourth quarter results.
 
The double
-
B
 
and investment grade markets held in pretty well, although 
the pricing has widened. We see investors wanting to put capital to work in 
that market but they are being more selective. They are looking at higher 
quality names and extracting larger new issue 
concessions, but in terms of 
outlook we continue to under write new commitments predominantly in the 
double
-
B space and the investment grade space and that reflects the current 

highly fo
cused on and containing and managing that position as best we can.
 

book still stays and looks pretty good. It remains stable, strong credit quality 
no real changes in those metrics, c

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous

Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning. Just to follow
-
up and stay on the topic of corporate credit. 
And more broadly then the sort of energy E&P type stuff that you talked 
about where you gave good color. In your experience what are the leading 
indicators of credit deterioration 
that you drilled down on broadly away from 
energy and the commodities [indiscernible], how are they looking right now 
and is there any reason that you can think of as to why this would be 
different this time?
 
James Gorman
 

elative and historical performance. I think 

starting to see some pressure in the energy complex as I said across the 
other metrics, particularly for us given the health of our cust
omer base. In 


million, clearly a portion which is energy. So we are seeing a churn in the 
credit cycle. But again
 

been focused in, on the on the energy complex right now.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 

-
up question on wealth 
management. Looking at your Slide 16, the net interest inco
me growth in a 
range of 75 basis points to 175 basis points of margin contribution, if 

 
I 

assumptions. So where would we be in terms of that range if short
-
term 
interest rates stay wher
e they are currently as opposed to actually 
incorporating the forward curve?
 
James Gorman
 
I think the right way to think about that, those numbers, I would say, do not 
require any incremental rise in rates from where we are today. If the 
forward curve is r
ealized, we will get some incremental benefit, but those 



e the forward curve to 
hit those margin targets.

Christian Bolu

Christian Bolu
 


-
time as in 2015. So I guess the 
first question is how much litigation and severance costs did you incur 
in 
2015?
 
And then two, of that $1 billion in cost saves how much of that is roll off of 
the 2015 litigation and severance cost versus incremental business 
rationalization?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Again of that, $1 billion as James mentioned, that assumes no 
individual one 

of our business. We were happy to see the litigation expense go down in the 
fourth quarter, but in terms of breaking out those individual numbers, we 
have histo


 
it does require no major 
single individual event.
 
Christian Bolu
 

of just about $500 million of litigation costs through the third quarter and
 

 
James Gorman
 


-
to
-
date as I 
said our litigat
ion came down materially in the fourth quarter and the 
severance of the $150 million was across the firm in the fourth quarter, 

severance would be embedded in that billion dollars.
 
Christ
ian Bolu
 

going forward or you assume it comes down from that at least $555 million 
we had as of the third quarter.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, I think we believe that the most significant item
s related to the credit 
crisis are largely behind us. This quarter it was good to see litigation come 
down and so I think there is an embedded assumption along those lines but 

 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. And then my
 
follow
-
up just on the lending 

 

trying to reconcile the current target versus the prior target so you had 

 
you expected $180 billion in total U.S. Bank assets by the end of 2016. Does 
that still stand and then how do we think of 2017
?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
In terms of the 

 
what I would say is the slide in the deck is only in the 

coming back to you with more detail throughout the year but in terms of the 
2016 number that l
oan growth that you see out of wealth management 
would be consistent with those targets.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. 
Please go ahead.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Hi, 
good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So, I appreciate the detailed guidance certainly as part of the broader 


s investors are 

to 9% to 11% ROE versus some of the different guidance components.
 

a 74% efficiency rat
io, 32% tax rate, and flat preferreds and non
-
controlling 
interest, it gets to you about $6 billion of net income to common and if I 
even take just the low end of that 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied 
common equity is about $66 billion which suggests payou
ts in excess of 
100% over the next two years. So I just wanted to get an understanding as 
to of what elements or components of that analysis might be flawed or 
needs to be tweaked and how should we 

 
and what capital return 
assumptions are embedded in that
 
9% to 11% ROE target range that you 
highlighted for 2017?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Let me try to take a swing at this one. So as we laid out on the page, first of 
all the compensation, the billion dollars plus of compensation and non
-
comp 
savings are assuming a flat re
venue environment so if we get out two years 

expect revenue growth throughout this period and therefore the efficiency 
ratio should be lower than the 74% because we do have operating l
everage 
in the business.
 
First and foremost, and so I think that is probably the biggest disconnect in 
your math. You can see in the revenue bucket or the modest revenue 
growth bucket we do have improvements in different business segments. 
And then in term
s of the capital base, ideally, we believe we have sufficient 
capital, we had been accreting capital over the course of the last several 
years. We would expect to probably accrete a little bit more capital over the 
coming period. But we would like to try t
o slow 

 
clearly slowdown the 
accretion of capital since we have 

 
we believe we have the appropriate 
amount of capital for our current plan.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Okay, thanks. And Jonathan, I think you spend a lot of time talking about 
capital and 

from regulators and presumably they would be inclined or incentivized to 
reward actions to reduce your systemic risk footprint or exposure system 
with more risk intensive activities, based on yo
ur discussions have you been 
given any indication that they would be perceptive to higher payouts for 
those that are willing to shrink more aggressively in those areas.
 
James Gorman
 

about this. We did what we think is right for our business. Our job is to 
generate returns to our business; however, arithmetically if you have met all 
of the capital targets by definition, if you change the structure of your 
business and throw off additio

need that all will be available for returns. Do I think that there is going to be 
one
-


a position where we 
increase our returns, absolutely.
 

reason, for that they are accreting more capital than they need for their 

y restructured 

to get ahead of them 

 
that would not be a smart thing to do but I do think 

regulatory p
ush has been.
 
Steven Chubak

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go 
ahead.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi, your 9% to 11% ROE target, you have a ti
meframe on that for the first 
time ever, I appreciate it. But what is that on a tangible ROE basis?
 
James Gorman
 

on our capital base, somewhere around 125 basis points, above th
ose 
numbers just math.
 
Mike Mayo
 
All right, so the target on a tangible basis is 10% to 12%?

We have an ROE target of 9% to 11%.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Okay.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
For all of our common equity.
 
Mike Mayo
 

 
it just a target that sits 

target to the organization?
 
James Gorman
 
Not totally sure, I understand your question. All of our employees are bonus 
eligible paid in stock. The stock is
 
generally performed somewhere in line 
with ROE and price to book so everybody is affected by that. The most 
senior management team I receive as part of their compensation 
performance units which are directly affected too by ROE and total 
shareholder retur

doing this to frankly drive up our personal comp.
 

at or above 10% and nobody in this world predicted the last four or 
five 

required to support these businesses when I took this job our capital base 

the challenge has been
 
to get the R moving consistent with that rate of 
growth of the E.
 

understandably they want to know what is a realistic timeframe just to 

how do the pieces 
add up mathematically, to get you there. Are they believable, are they 
plausible and we thought it might going to be smart to layout what we think 
is a realistic timeframe that kind of range 9% to 11% 2017, the pieces are 
we are definitel
y taking out expenses, some of them are in the bag, if you 
will.
 
And some of them are going to be driven by management processes that we 
put in place. We believe there is revenue growth across many parts of our 
business over a two year period and we 
believe we are sufficiently 
capitalized given the world that we operate in so if you add all those pieces 
together putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework 
rather than open ended seem to be the right transition point for Morgan

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Thanks guys. James, just on t
he FIC side of the business, post restructuring, 


expect much of a drop
-
off. Just wanted to understand is that relati
ve to like 
the second half of 2015, like total 2015 or is there any way to gauge it from 
like a return on asset like what you expect in FIC going forward?
 
James Gorman
 
No, I think of that in terms of the full year, obviously the second half but our 
revenue run rates of $500 million were incredibly low. But we look what the 
total market size is what our share is, and what our expected share is, and 


-
sized for 
revenue rate equivalent to 2015. We obviously 

 

outlook.
 
Michael Carrier
 


 
I guess you 
mentioned like with the weak mark
ets some of the impact that you can see 
in investment management. So I guess just two things on that. Last quarter 
we saw that kind of negative accrual I think on the Asia private equity your 
Merchant Banking fund [ph], just what type of exposure unit in t
he 
investment management business have 

 
those types of products so we can 
see those swings. And then in wealth management I feel like the transaction 

trend but just wanted to figure
 
out are we stabilizing here, meaning are 
there pressures there somewhat coming to a slowdown?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Sure, a couple of questions. I think on the investment management question 
the way I would try to think about it is there basically two major componen
ts 
of how we make business in that 

 
how we make money in that business, 
one is just our fee revenues from managing money.
 


 


t will be 

The second line as you said is the investment line. When I refer to the 

supplement, that number was 
negative $235 million last quarter we said 
that was predominately driven by our reversal of carry in our Asia PE fund or 
funds. This quarter it was $100 million that return to a positive number was 
driven by all of our 

 
most of our investing businesses bo
th private equity 
infrastructure and real estate that was more balanced.
 
We said in the third quarter when we took the reversal of carry that that 
eliminated the vast majority 

 
excuse me, the majority of the carry that we 
have accrued in our Asia PE busin
esses we obviously have a carry accrued in 

certainly in Asia has been reduced and the fund that was under stress in the 
third quarter had no material changes, had no material changes t
his quarter. 
That was the first part of your question. I think, the second on transactional 
revenues. Those numbers have been subdued. Clients are cautious, whether 

numbers
 
hopefully have stabilized.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay, thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo 
Securities. Please go ahead.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Good morning, thanks for taking my question. First of all, maybe for 
you, 
Jon on page 3 of the supplement, you break out the regional revenues, looks 

Americas up double
-
digit in EMEA and up high single
-
digit in Asia. How are 
you thinking about those 

 
t
hat revenue mix heading into 2016 given all 
your comments about some of the challenges emanating out of China and 
some of the growth challenges in Europe?
 
Jon Pruzan
 

I think th
e results this quarter, we did see Asia was down, but it continues to 
be a strong and important part of our business. We did see weakness in the 
fourth quarter relative to the third quarter in Europe given the concerns and 
uncertainty around Brexit and som
e of the immigration issues, we still think 
that Europe although showing some signs of growth in certain areas, is 
going to be a fragile economy and the drivers of our business will be the 
U.S. and Asia.
 
In terms of the third 

 

 
front of me. Just this 
minute, but that you should also know is managed, the way we look at the 

tied back to the tax rate that I talked about earlier regarding the geographic 
mix of e
arnings.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Okay, thank you, and then a little closer to home, how are you thinking, it 

things, as well as Within Wealth Management is going to continue at what 
appears to be r
oughly similar growth rate as you saw this year. But I guess 

regulatory scrutiny both in areas like leverage lending, but also in 
commercial real estate which seem 

 
which where yo


program.
 
Jon Pruzan
 


h in both the 
ISG lending product as well as the Wealth Management lending product and 
those have been the key drivers along with deploying our deposits away 
from securities into these loans. Those have been the key drivers of the NII 
growth historically.
 
I think going forward I would tell you that the primary driver of the lending 
growth is going to be Wealth Management. The growth assumptions in the 
ISG part of the business are much lower than they had been over the last 
couple of years as we built those 
portfolios up. So the key driver is going to 
be Wealth Management area.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Okay. And then just ripping on that theme, James, you mentioned less than 
2% of your Wealth Management clients have a mortgage with Morgan 

 
the next two years to get that ratio to?
 
James Gorman
 



-

 

 


 
about 10%. 
You can see the numbers on the chart which just show mathematically what 
the total residential lending is $21 billion, up from $16 billion. So I guess 
that would imply we did about 2.4%.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Okay, thanks for taking 
my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. 
Please go ahead.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. When we 
think about the 3% to 5% revenue growth with ROE target, 
yes, some items 
like NII should increase without the backdrop changing and hopefully will be 
above that. So on the other hand, investment banking has been operating at 
a high level as you highlighted, a choppy market could impact those 
businesses.
 
So just 
thinking about, what type of investment banking revenues or 
environment during that 3% to 5% revenue growth, and sounds like you 
guys are a little more cautious on the near
-
term there. So is that fair? And 
then and how do you think about those businesses b
roadly relative to their 
cycle?
 
Jon Pruzan
 

say the Wealth Management is being really driven by the lending growth and 
some of the other initiatives we have there. In terms of bot
h equities and 
investment banking, listen, we think that we can continue to gain some 
share there. We have good shares in those businesses, but the backdrop is a 

situation where revenu
e pools for these products decline precipitously, these 
are 

 

bit of share gain and a little bit of revenue or pie growth.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay, great, helpful. And then just within the Wea
lth Management comp 
target that improvement to less than 56%, is that and entirely driven by 
leverage off of higher margin revenues like NII or are there other core comp 
expense reductions that they can occur within GWN, the GWN that we 
should be thinking 
about?
 
Jon Pruzan
 

-
compensable revenues is 


 
for the totality of the firm, 
we are very focused on expenses and comp and there are some other levers 
that we
 
can use here other than just the growing non

compensable line 
item.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay. Thank you very much.

James G

Well, I can take out and Jon may want to add something. CCAR is a function, 
there are five different ratios under the normal scenario and then the 
severely adverse scenario, where we had an issue to the extent we did was 
on the total leverage ratio w
hich we addressed with the top preferred 
securities. So I think was 

 
CCAR was submitted last November, December I 
think.

Your final question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please 
go ahead.
 
Fiona Swaffield
 
Hi. Just had two areas. One was, you talked about funding benefits, I think 

tailwind from now funding cost. I just wondered if 
you could talk a bit more about how much that was for 2015 and also where 


 
you could talk about 
that.
 
And then the last area was really on Slide 16, on the deposit assumptions. I 
have thought that there was a big strategy to increase the deposits. I think I 
had a number in my head of $200 billion. Has that changed or is it that 

 

your 2017 kind of roll forward? Thanks.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Okay. so the 

 
Fiona, the two parts of the question, I think on the funding 

at go into those lines 
including the size of our balance sheet, secured versus unsecured. What we 
said, just to give you some 

 
to try to cuff it we did about $21 billion of new 
unsecured last year and those came in at rates that were significantly below 
w
here the historical debt had been issued, our average maturity or WAM on 
our unsecured stack now is about six years.
 
So, we were sort of retiring five year debt and putting on slightly longer, but 
we saw our credit spreads were easily 100 tighter than wher
e they were 
before. That process went out through 

 
that process went on throughout 

will continue to get the benefit from those funding savings as we annualize. 
And so that, I think
 
addresses question number one.
 
And question number two on the deposits, we will continue to grow our 
deposit base. I think what we would like to try to do this year and 2016, is 
try to optimize the deposits. We have different deposits that have different 

highlighted in the strategy 

 
excuse me, in the strategy deck without 
growing our deposit base, but clearly that is a goal, and in 2017 that will be 
requirement to support our future l

of the digital strategy and cash management product that are 

 

growing out, and that will support 

 
that will hopefully drive the deposit 
growth in 2017 and beyond.

James Gorman
 
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. 
At the 
beginning of 2016, we laid out several strategic priorities that we aim 
to achieve in 2017. The most important of which was to generate an ROE 
within the range of 9% to 11%. Other priorities included achieving a wealth 
management pre
-
tax margin of 23% to 2
5%, delivering on project 
streamline and improving results across our fixed income division. These 
priorities were consistent 
--
 
were contingent upon modest revenue growth, a 
continuation of our capital distribution plan and the absence of any outsized 
lit
igation expenses or penalties.
 
2017 has started well. We remain focused and continued to demonstrate 
strong expense discipline. Wealth management recorded a pre
-
tax margin 
well within our target range, and the fixed income division delivered 
revenues meani
ngfully north of our $1 billion average quarterly goal.
 
These public markers, combined with continued strength in investment 
banking, leadership and equities and improved returns in investment 
management, all contributed to one of the strongest quarters in
 
recent 
history. The net impact of these efforts was an ROE north of 10%, again well 

of the many difficult decision and business growth initiatives best proved as 
we begin 2017. In
 
addition, in the first quarter, the Federal Reserve 
announced that it did not object to our resubmitted 2016 capital plan. 
Separately, along with all our peers, we recently submitted our capital plan 
for the 2017 CCAR cycle. Strong capital return remains 
a critical element to 
our future success.
 
All of that said, we live in uncertain times. You are well aware the political 
and geopolitical uncertainties that exist on the domestic front, as well as 
abroad. How this will impact markets during the rest of the
 
year is too early 
to predict. We will remain nimble should the macro environment change 
materially. Notwithstanding these risks, given our business model and 
leading positions in several franchises,we expected continue to deliver 
appropritate returns in t
he absence of a major disruption.
 
In addition to the obvious uncertainties, there are two notable policy areas 
that could meaningfully affect us in a positive way in the next several years; 
first, the potential for reduction of the domestic corporate tax r
ate. Almost 
all of our wealth management business and a significant part of our 
institutional securities businesses are based in the United States; secondly, 
the perspective regulatory changes. At the very least, it is hard to imagine 
the regulatory burden
 
increasing from this point forward and some of the 
policy proposals being floated, make good common sense. Given Morgan 

could substantially impact us over the coming years. I am 

lot more about this at the rest of this call and in subsequent quarters.
 
I will now turn over to Jon to discuss this particular quarter in greater detail.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you, James and good morning. Results in the first quarter we
re 
strong, aided by an active new cycle, improved sentiment and solid 
economic data. Firm revenues of $9.7 billion were up 8% compared to Q4. 
In the first quarter, CBT was $2.8 billion, EPS was $1 and ROE was 10.7%. 
Our performance was buoyd by typical fir
st quarter seasonality as well as 
momentum, following the U.S. elections. Importantly, we produced results 
characteristic of constructive markets and we controlled expenses, 
highlighting the operating leverage in our business. Our efficiency ratio 
improved
 
to 71% this quarter.
 
I will spend a minute on our expenses and project streamline before turning 
to the businesses. Compared to the fourth quarter, non
-
interest expenses of 
$6.9 billion were up approximately $160 million or 2%. This increase was 
driven by
 
higher compensation expenses, which rose 9% sequentially due to 
higher revenues and the impact of mark
-
to
-
market on our deferred 
compensation plans across the firm. Non
-
compensation expenses were down 
approximately $220 million or 8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Recall, Q4 included 
elevated seasonal expenses and a provision in connection with the tax 
reporting issue. Given fourth quarter seasonality, the year
-
over
-
year 
comparison maybe more relevant when trying to understand the impact of 
project streamline.
 
Year
-
over
-
year revenues were up $2 billion while non
-
compensation 
expenses increased by only $100 million over the same period. These results 
demonstrate our operating leverage and discipline. We remain well on our 
way to executing roughly 200 expense initiati
ves that we identified as part of 
project streamline. This is included; using robotic process automation to 
consolidate our technology support; rationalizing our North American data 
centers and to modern and environmentally sound centers that now host 
high
 
density technologies; and introducing a cloud based procurement 
platform, which uses more straight through processing and payments; 
informing more intelligent purchasing decisions. We also continue to 
implement the workforce strategy we have shared with y
ou last year. During 
the remainder of 2017, our focus will be on completing the remaining 
initiatives and more importantly, on keeping these costs permanently out of 
the expense base.
 
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise performed 
well 
in Q1. Our businesses built on Q4 momentum and produced strong results 
with total net revenue of $5.2 billion, up 12% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 7% 
sequentially driven by lower seasonal expe
nses, partially offset by higher 
execution related costs. Compensation expenses were $1.9 billion, reflecting 
an ISG compensation to net revenue ratio of approximately 36% consistent 
with our target of maintaining a ratio at or below 37%.
 
In Investment Ban
king, we generated $1.4 billion in revenues, an 11% 
increase over the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by strong 
underwriting results across both debt and equity, partially offset by a decline 
in advisory revenues. Advisory revenues for the quarter 
were $496 million, 
down 21% versus a very strong fourth quarter. Clients remain engaged and 
interested in discussing strategic transactions, and pipelines are healthy.
 
Turning to underwriting, continued investor optimism combined with stable 
capital market
s characterized by low volatility and tighter credit spreads, 
translated into strong underwriting activity in the first quarter. While equity 
volumes are still well below peak levels, Q1 represented a more constructive 
new issue market with low overall vol
atility and fewer specific risk events. 
Against this backdrop and with a strong pipeline coming into the new year, 
equity underwriting revenues were $390 million, up 73% versus the fourth 
quarter.
 
We expect activity levels to remain healthy, although upcom
ing events such 
as European elections and continued policy uncertainty, may affect issuance 
windows. Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 26% sequentially to 
$531 million, driven by strength in investment grade bond and high yield 
financing issuanc
e in attractive credit environment.
 
Our sales and trading business performed well as constructive market 
conditions witnessed in the fourth quarter carried into the first quarter. 
Revenue increased 10% on a sequential basis to $3.5 billion. In equities, we
 
were number one in the U. S. and expect to retain our number one global 
position. Despite a decline in volumes, first quarter revenues were $2 billion, 
up 3% compared to the fourth quarter. Results were driven by strength in 
both derivatives and cash equi
ties in a more stable trading environment.
 
The first quarter results underscore the importance of our product breadth 
and geographic diversity. We saw strength in Europe and continued stability 
in the Americas, which was partially offset by weaker results 
in Asia. Despite 
various economic and political challenges, we remain committed to our 
global footprint. Fixed income revenues in the first quarter were $1.7 billion, 
up 17% versus a strong fourth quarter. A constructive trading environment 
and uptick in c
lient activity, variability in interest rate expectations and a 
favorable credit environment, contributed to these results.
 
In our credit businesses, we saw continuation of the increased market 
volumes that followed on the back of the U. S. elections. Stea
dy client 
activity and favorable market conditions across products, drove strong 
performance. In particular, our securitized product business performed well, 
driven by spread tightening and strong demand. Our macro businesses 
witnessed a sequential decreas
e in revenues. While our rates business 
benefited from increased client activity related to repricing of interest rate 
expectations in the U. S., this was partially offset by a decline in foreign 
exchange. After a challenging environment in Q1 2016, this q
uarter marks 
the fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of our $1 billion 
target.
 
The results have increased our confidence as the business has experienced 
good momentum, reinforcing that it is critically and credibly sized. Average 
trading VaR
 
for the period was $44 million up versus a historically low level 
of $39 million last quarter. As we have discussed, the derisking of our 
balance sheet over the last several quarters has provided us with significant 
capacity to prudently raise VaR to supp
ort accretive client opportunities. In 
the first quarter, we saw both strong client demand and pockets of volatility, 
contributing to an increase in both spot and average trading VaR.
 
Now turning to Wealth Management .In the first quarter, we reported reco
rd 
revenues of $4.1 billion, representing 2% sequential increase. The CBT 
margin at 24% was the highest since the Smith Barney acquisition and sale 
firmly within our 2017 target range. Importantly, drivers of this business are 
healthy. We witnessed increas
ed fee
-
based asset flows, additional lending, 
better client engagement and eliminate FA attrition.
 
Client assets reached $2.2 trillion, a record high, reflecting rising domestic 
and global equity industries. Fee based assets increased 6% to $927 billion, 
i
ncluding net asset flows of $19 billion. This represents the highest fee based 
asset flows since 4Q14. Asset Management revenues were flat sequentially. 
Higher asset levels and positive flows were largely offset by the effect of 
fewer calendar days in the 
quarter.
 
Net interest income was up modestly. The benefit of higher rates and loan 
balances in the first quarter was partially offset by the impact of lower 
prepayment amortization in the fourth quarter. Year
-
over
-
year, we have 
seen strong net interest inc
ome growth of 20% and we remain confident 
with the net interest income guidance we provided in February. We are 
positioned to continue to benefit from higher rates and lending growth. Bank 
lending balances were up $1 billion quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Transacti
on revenues of $823 million were up 6% from 4Q16. Higher mark
-
to
-
 
market gains on our deferred compensation plans had a meaningful 
impact on the sequential increase. Additionally, we witnessed a recovery in 
the underwriting calendar, especially in structur
ed projects as issuers 
capitalize on increased retail demand for new issue product.
 
Total expenses were flat versus 4Q as seasonally lower business 
development expenses were partially offset by higher compensation 
expenses. The compensation ratio of 57% wa
s negatively impacted by 
seasonality and the impact of mark
-
to
-
market on our deferred compensation 
plans.
 
Looking forward, we remain optimistic about the outlook for this business. 
The steady increase in fee based assets position us well to build our 
annua
tized revenues. We continue to invest in our digital capabilities, which 
overtime, will encourage asset aggregation and increase FA and client 
engagement. We look forward to sharing more with you on this topic later 
this quarter.
 
Finally, we are 
confident in the attractiveness of our platform and the 
opportunities that affords us to recruit and retain talent as the landscape 
continues to favor scale players. Investment management saw stable asset 
management fees and better investment results. Tota
l net revenues were 
$609 million, up 22% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. AUM grew to $421 billion in the 
quarter. Market appreciation and equities and fixed income, and positive 
flows and alternative products, contributed to a modest uptick versus 4Q16.
 
Asset manage
ment fees for the quarter were stable at $517 million. 
Investment revenues were $98 million, up $122 million compared to the 
fourth quarter, which was adversely impacted by the sales and markdowns 
of non
-
strategic third
-
party LP investments. Overall expens
es were up 7% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter, primarily driven by compensation expenses 
attributable to higher carried interest.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot asset increased to $832 billion. As I 
mentioned earlier in the year, we had the capital capacity
 
to increase our 
balance sheet if the client opportunities and returns justify the usage. Pro 
forma fully phased
-
in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be 
approximately $360 billion, down $10 billion from the fourth quarter, driven 
by lower operational
 
risk RWAs.
 
The reduction in RWAs contributed to a 70 basis point increased in our pro 
forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio of 
16.6%, bringing it more in line with our pro forma fully phased in Basel III 
standardized common e
quity Tier 1 ratio. As the two ratios have almost 
converged, we will be disclosing both, going forward.
 
Our pro forma fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter 
increased to 6.4%. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 
$75
0 million of common stock or approximately 17 million shares, and our 
Board declared $0.20 dividend per share.
 
Our tax rate in the first quarter was 29%. This includes $112 million tax 
benefit attributable to the employee share
-
based payment accounting 
cha
nge adopted in January. This accounting change is permanent, and will 
impact our quarterly and annual effective tax rate. Given our stock vesting 
schedule, the most meaningful impact will occur in the first quarter of each 
year when restricted stock units 
convert into common stock. If our stock 
appreciates over vesting period, we will have a benefit and if our stock 
depreciates between the grant and vesting date, we will have an expense. 
This change, along with the variability of our geographic mix of busin
ess, will 
make the tax rate somewhat more volatile.
 
We expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the 32% to 
33% range. As James said in the opening, the strong results this quarter

ction momentum 
continued into 2017 and provided a healthy backdrop for most of our 
businesses. Our M&A and underwriting pipelines remain healthy and macro 
events should continue to provide opportunities for our trading businesses.
 
Our wealth business is pe
rforming well and has several tailwinds that have 
begun to materialize. Our investment management business have seen flows 
stabilize and better investing performance. However, questions around 

tiatives, 
resulted in more sporatic client activity towards the end of the first quarter. 
This was consistent with a broader theme that began to crystalize in late 
March. The contrast between the strength of the global economy and the 
unease around U. S. p
olicy outcomes and potential geopolitical streams.

[Operator Instructions] And our f
irst question comes from the line of 
Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
So really encouraging to see securities business put up another good 

much un
stable footing, the restructuring worked out very, very well with 
that really repositioning. What are you focused on from here, when you 
think about the potential for less hostile regulatory environment. Where that 
might provide opportunities versus how yo
ur franchise is positioned, how 
should we think about that, going forward? And how do you balance the idea 
of potentially getting better returns in that business versus returning capital 
to shareholders. Could you help us how you're thinking about that?
 
Ja
mes Gorman
 
Brandon, I think I'd have to write you a 10 page paper on that one, hell of 
an opener. Let me stop, because that's going to feed into, I suspect about 
two
-
thirds of the questions we get on this call. Firstly, just on the business, I 
mean; frankl

quarter. Obviously, happy with the way the quarter turned out. I think the 
team did a terrific job in navigating an environment that was clearly not 
consistent through the quarter. As Jon said,
 
the back half of March was 
much tougher than the early part of the quarter.
 
So number one, is just keep executing; manage our expenses in the 
businesses where we can keep up share, pick up share in the businesses 

t's number one. Number two, we 
are committed to returning capital in a meaningful and accelerating basis in 
the years ahead. And if we continue to accrete earnings of this level, there's 
no reason why we shouldn't keep doing that. And with that retire a nu
mber 
of shares that we're very focused on our share count.
 
So the combination of dividend increases and further buybacks are critical to 
further driving the ROE performance of this firm. And not the only thing but 
they fully, given that drives the denomina

of the answer. We just submitted the 2017 plan obviously, getting the 
resubmission on 2016 done successfully was critical. The 2017 plan is we've 
had I think four or five years of dividend and capital increases. And I thi
nk 
it's fair to say that we like that trajectory. I'm not going to get into what our 
ask was but between us and the federal reserve until we get the results. But 
we retained a lot of earnings last year and we like to keep driving our capital 
returns up. So
 
let me just leave it at that.
 
On the regulatory front, there's huge moving parts, I mean 
--
 
and on fiscal 
policy; first the corporate tax rate, as we said, we have a large business that 
is almost entirely in the U. S. and large parts of the rest of the fi
rm are in 
the U. S. So anything on the corporate tax rate front is positive to Morgan 

there will be movement on that rate. I suspect it will be a little more modest 
and some of 
the numbers that have been thrown out. But nonetheless, 
anything sub 30%, appears probable would be very positive.
 
On the regulatory front, I think the weight of opinion is that while the U. S. 
financial system is demonstrably healthier than it was going i
nto the crisis 

capital burden and regulatory burden on the system and some of the 
elements of that and some of the lack of transparency elements are right for 
real change, and that has b
een acknowledged all the way from board 
members of the federal reserves on down. And so as we said, it's too early 
to predict what regulatory changes occur. But let me give you just a very 
simple one.
 
If the banks are able to submit their CCAR plan, get th
e results bad and then 
submit what they capital ask is, there'll be no guessing about how much 
capital you have or you don't have. It would be up to the boards of directors 
and the banks to figure out what the right capital ask is given how much 
capital th
ey've got. Had Morgan Stanley done that last year? We would have 
had $2 billion of extra capital to adjudicate on with that board. That's a 
simple and to me very obvious fix to stop the guessing of what capital 

 
I think there's a compelling argu
ment to move a lot of these regulatory 

system has been build inside the banks, which make them much more 
predictable. And in terms of the CCAR, CLAR resolution planning processes, 
I'm not sure putting all of these on an annual cycle, which is very expensive, 
very time consuming, is terribly additive. The amount of response time you 
have to those is matter of months before you resubmit again.
 

ut some of the other specific 
things. But I think there are a number of very specific fixes that both relieve 
the expense and time consumption, now that the plans are relatively 
mature, without attracting all from the regulatory rigor that is necessary for
 
strong and healthy banking system. And for those banks that are fully 
capitalized, which we clearly count ourselves among them, it provides them 
with an opportunity to return that excess capital to shareholders.
 
Brennan Hawken
 

ly thorough. I know it was a pretty broad 
question, but thanks for that James. Taking in a little bit, we heard some 
--
 
there seems to be some momentum behind the SLR and may be some 
potential for changes there. Not asking you to predict what could change 
with that calculation. But just more broadly, if we do see SLR relief, what 
would you feel about as far as your PV business, how much further 
momentum do you feel like you can grow? And do you think that that should 
continue to provide a nice tailwind on t
o the equities business broadly, just 
given the non
-
box approach.
 
James Gorman
 

think there are too many contingencies in there, if this and if that then what 
would happen. I think it'
s fair to say the denominator in SLR clearly should 
be adjusted. And I think there has been lot of discussion in the White House 
in treasury and across the various regulatory bodies about that. And making 
it A, more consistent with the Europeans, I think t
here is also an argument 
by the way bringing the ratio, which is currently 5% of capital to the growth 
that balance sheet to the European level, I suppose 3%.
 
So there are some pretty significant differences between different 
jurisdictions. And I think har
monizing those makes sense. I think you will 
see an adjustment to the denominator, the total balance sheet under the, 


affect our

do you think that momentum in market share can continue given where you

Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen, we're been very pleased with the performance in that business, as 

generating significantly more revenues and we had before that restructuring 
with lower expenses an
d less people. So the operating leverage in that 
business has been very good. Our market share and momentum in that 
business has been good. And I think we feel confident that we will continue 
to be relevant to our clients, support other ISG businesses. And
 
the ultimate 
results will really be a function of the markets. In a growing market, we 
would expect to participate in that growth. And in the shrinking market, it 
becomes more challenging and we would try to defend our positions.

that. I heard one of my peers say every time he hears about 21st century 


vickers rule in the
 
UK. Again, we have a very different business model from 
the universal banks, but we do have a significant deposit business.
 
And I am comfortable on a global competitive basis the more pure 
investment bank models would be least effective by that kind of st
ructure or 
holding company structure with separate divisions with so called ring fences

James Gorman
 
The best way to describe it is just look at the quarter

quarter results 
and describe the macro backdrop that we were operating under. We had 
really good performance in the Americas around our credit 
businesses, good 
environment there, both tightening spreads and activity levels, securitized 
products, as well as the credit complex more broadly. On the macro side, 

and how, we did see 
more activity. And our rates business was stronger in 
the quarter, that was offset by the FX business where we 
--
 
it's a smaller 
business for us, but it was still impacted really by really low volatility in that 
sector, as well as less client engagement.
 
A
nd then commodities, which is a smaller business for us now, performed 
well over the stable environment. So a reasonable amount of hedging 
activity, and client engagement there. So broadly speaking, a good quarter 
for the businesses and the strength was pr
etty much across all products, 
except for really FX.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
That actually helps a lot, defined on the product that level. Geographically, 
do you have a stronger weighting in the Americas, or is it reasonably global 
diverse?
 
James Gorman
 
Definitely, t
he global footprint is important. But basically in all of our ISG 
businesses, the Americas would be the biggest contributor. You see our 
revenue breakdowns, I know as a firm and the supplement which has about 
70% of our revenues coming, give or take from t
he Americas. But we do 
have strong footprint in both EMEA and Asia and so we had good 
performance across the board.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak 
with Nomura. Your line is now open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So want to 
kick things off with a question on CCAR in the capital stack, your 
CET1 ratio is clearly very strong. As we await the results for the upcoming 
CCAR exam, historically, leverage has tended to be a bit more constraining 
for you guys. And with the inclusion o
f the SLR in this upcoming test and 
also given the latest preferred issuance you announced, I was hoping you 
could just shed some light on how the introduction of the SLR constraint 
actually informs your thinking in terms of excess capital; and how we shou
ld 
expect you to manage the capital stack going forward, whether we should 
see some incremental pref issuance from here.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. So as you said, first of all, in terms of our capital and how we think 
about it, a couple of quick things; one, i
n the beginning of '16, we said we 
were capital sufficient for the business mix and our risk profile. James did 
mention we accumulated capital over the course of the year. We have 
started to put some of that capital back into the businesses. We grew the 
ba
lance sheet a bit here in the first quarter. It's the first time in a while that 
we've done that, but we saw a good client engagement and good return 
opportunities.
 
CCAR is our binding constraint when it comes to capital. And as you 
highlight, the 
leverage ratio has historically for at least the last two years 
been what has been our lowest ratio post stress. SLR new this year, again 
the models aren't particularly transparent but we'll have to see what the 
results are when we get them back in June. B
ut we have generally been 
more constrained around leverage than we have around the risk rate asset 
ratios because we've taken risk dramatically down 
--
 
our RWAs dramatically 
down, particularly in our fixed income business.
 
So leverage still the constraint 
and then I think your last comment was on 
the stack. We did do a preferred issuance, it's been effective, a cost effective 
capital contributor. And we'll just obviously have to see what our results are 
and what the markets are going forward to determine ho
w we manage that 
stack.
 
James Gorman
 
I would just give, add something to that. I mean the constraints and the way 
that supplemental leverage ratio is going to play out, all presume but the 
current CCAR methodology and approach continues as is. And again, b
ack to 
some of the 
--
 
what I would regard as practical fixes to CCAR, I give you one 
in addition to ones we kicked off this with. The banks are required to 
continue to presume they will distribute 
--
 
do their buybacks for nine 
quarters after we're in a bil
lable scenario. So in our case, the buyback last 
year was 3.5 billion, nine quarters is approximately 7.7 billion. So you're 
carrying effectively 7.7 billion, but in theory you continue to payout to 
shareholders for nine quarters after in a billable scenar
io. Not only is that 
unlikely but there is a very easy fix for that. You could had the board sign a 
letter or give the federal reserve feeder right to eliminate the buyback 
program the moment we get into this kind of scenario, that would be a very 
easy fix
.
 
I understand the logic of holding banks whatever their dividend program is 
because in previous crisis some banks did not cut their dividends to try and 
evidence strength. But there is no bank board that we continue to buy back 
stock when their capital is
 
being depleted. So that of itself creates an 
enormous capital access sitting inside these institutions before you get to 
which leverage ratio, which constraining ratio it bumps into. So fixes like 
that, which are pragmatic, sensible just obvious things th
at could be done to 
make the thing more transparent and more realistic about the way they real 
operates, I think is part of what I hope the new administration is going to be 
looking at it. And I think they should look at it because U. S. financial 
system s
hould be operating on the same footing as financial systems around 
the world.
 
Steven Chubak
 

some of those practical changes as part of his stress capital buffer approach. 
But al
so as part of some of those proposed changes that he outlined and this 
was back in September, did note that we want to include surcharges in the 

as to whether you thought some of th
e changes that he outlined were in fact 
sensible, since he is no longer in that seat and there is 
--
 
it's unclear 
whether some of those changes he outlined will in fact be implemented.
 
James Gorman
 

sly, I read the 
speech and had this discussion many times. So I think that change in the 
second one was the balance sheets grow during the times of financial stress. 

acquisition. So again,
 
it is clearly illogical to have balance sheet growth 
during a time of financial stress. The assets would depreciate in value and 
institutions will be shrinking not growing. So those two things, the buy back 
and balance sheet growth, drove up the capital l
evels.
 
When you took those out I guess the view in that speech was you would 

sheet growth and holding buy back or buffer is kind of irrelevant. But the 
objective would seem to b
e in that case simply add a buffer of capital to the 
institutions. My question is why, why do they need that? If they're 
capitalized at the level where the global institutions are capitalized and 
some, it appears to me that that would be a perfectly proven
 
place to start 
with. So I'm a big fan of commanizing the buy back and the balance sheet 
growth. I'm not a big fan of being taking that off the table, but simply 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think Steve on
e of the big challenges with all these questions is we just 

2017 results back, governor Trula did give a speech, but he is no longer in 
that seat, that seat is currently vacant. And u
ntil it gets filled then we get

Guy Moszkowski
 

a lot about capital, and I appreciate all the views on 
regulatory things that might change ahead or would make sense to change. 
I guess the question that I have been now that is what kind of visibility 
might there be to reducing excess capital over time, q
uite apart from 
regulatory change, which is of course hard to forecast at this point. Maybe 
you could give us some sense for the outlook in terms of further reduction in 

positions l


 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
You did see our new 
--
 
the capital allocation for the year. As you know, we 
allocate once and then keep 
it steady for the current year. We did continue 
to derisk the balance sheet over the course of the year, and fixed income 
and then you can see the results that we brought down capital in that 
business. As I said before, we have capital capacity to grow tha
t business. If 
the client opportunity there as well as the returns are there, I think we look 
at the sales in trading business now as one business and allocate resources 
to the business, and then try to optimize across the internal products, which 
were wit
hin that set. We increased our investment and the balance sheet 
this quarter, as I mentioned, in the sales and trading business. So we 
continue to see roll down of long
-


rt of the management of the business.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
And then just a follow
-
up question to something that James mentioned 
earlier, specifically with respect to the CCAR. That was an interesting 
proposal that came out of Congress, actually to change the CCA
R to every 
other year. And obviously, I hear you in terms of the potential cost saves. 
But is that really true, would you have to maintain significant apparatus and 
personnel, and maintain the systems and everything and probably one in 
parallel, overtime. 
Do you really save that much money from only running it 
every year? And I guess to put it in context, have you guys thought about 
what 
--
 
how that might compare to say the savings that you might be able 
to generate from a meaningful reduction in the Volcke
r risk reporting? How 
do those two compare in terms of cost saves?
 
James Gorman
 
Let me start
-
off with, forget about what the cost saves are, and just say 
what is the intended benefit of the CCAR process to determine if an 
institution has sufficient capital
 
and the stability of the scenario. And if it has 
been sufficiently robust in testing its processes, its risk management, 

quantitative aspect of it. My point is that it is an enor
mous task. In our case 

And it takes an enormous effort by our regulators to digest; there are many, 
many meetings between the regulators and management; there are 
horizontal revi
ew teams across all of the fed reserve.
 
And then eventually reporters produced pinning on whether you passed the 
quantitative and the qualitative by how much and various feedback relating 
to quantitative and qualitative. And then you resubmit again some mo
nths 
later. I just think the amount of time it takes to process all this information 
to meaningfully act on it, then the next annual submission appears very 
rapidly. So as a practical matter for an exercise of this rigor and substance, I 
think there would 
just be more value added in having people digest it for 
year and have really proper thoughtful responses over the longer time 
frame. Does it reduce the cost to the organization? Of course, it's just the 
time management from myself down through to the heads
 
of risk, audit, 
finance, compliance, legal, all down through the organizations and the whole 

the preparation of the 25,000 plus pages.
 
Is that the primary driver of this? No, in
 
my opinion, the primary driver 
should not be expense driven, it should be outcome driven. What is the right 
outcome to achieve the best result, which the regulators and frankly tax 
payers and the institutions and the shareholders want. And I think a more 
thoughtful outcome would be every other year, given the magnitude of it, so 
that's really my focus. It's not about money saving, does it have the 
additional outcome that expense would come down and distraction for an 
organization, sure. But that's not the 
objective. We all want a healthy and 
very safe and sound financial system, nobody is pushing against that. I think 
more time to digest changes and adjust to them for institutions of this 
complexity on a two year cycle would just make good common sense.
 
Ope
rator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom 
with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Jon, my question goes to the net interest income, I know you talked a bit 
about it. But I'm a little confused
 
still on the sequential trends, particularly 
as it relates to the cost of funds, which intuitively would have seen to have 
moved higher given rate hikes, both in December and recently. So can you 
just help me understand what's occurring there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I think if you're looking at the asset sensitivity or the net interest 
income in our wealth business, which is generally where most of the asset 
sensitivity is, a couple of things. We've grown that line item quite 
aggressively over th
e last several years over $2 billion in the last four year, 
including $500 million of growth last year. What I said in February is that we 
still expect to generate good growth in net interest income, albeit at a 
slightly slower pace. And we still feel good
 
about the guidance that we've 
given you.
 
What we've seen now that we've been through three, I guess, rate hikes in 
the last year and change, is that the model data has been higher than what's 
actually happened, in terms of the deposit base. And we still t
hink that 
roughly the 50% data that we've been using is the right, is a reasonable 
estimate going forward. But again, it's a model and we haven't really seen 
that many rate hikes over a long period of time, particularly given money 
market reform and digita
l products in terms of deposit behavior.
 
So at this point, we still think it's a reasonably good estimate. But our 
performance in wealth NII is strong and we still feel confident that we can 
grow that business, because of the lending products that we're of
fering to 
our clients, as well as the benefit of the forward curve this year and the 
potential for future rate hikes.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
But specifically understanding that maybe the deposit data isn't as high as 

with the actual decline in 
interest expense that you saw in Wealth Management, sequentially? Was it a 
change in liability structure, or I mean I guess I'm just surprised that that 
number went down, given that rates went up twice over that time frame.

I have two questions on Wealth Management, could you talk lending growth, 
because to me it seems to slowed markedly. Do you think you will meet the 
targets y
ou set out in the February presentation on the lending side, and 
where we're on penetration? And then separately just the non
-
compensation 
in Wealth Management, which was pretty low. I think you mentioned 
seasonal, but I mean its still looking good year
-
on
-
year. Is that something 
that that level could be sustained? Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
On the first point, when I do the second point first, because I forgot your 
first point. On the second point, the non
-
comps, we continue to manage 
aggressively non
-
comp
s across the firm. Wealth has been very good at that 
over the course of the last several years, improving the margins from below 
10% to now its current 24% level. The seasonality when we go from a fourth 
quarter to a first quarter, it's not a great sort of
 
non
-
comp expense 
comparison because of the seasonality and some of the spending accounts in 
the 
--
 
marketing of business expenses and wealth, but very strong expense 
discipline in that business and we would expect that to continue, and then 
on the target.
 
so the targets that we put out or the guidance that we gave in February, I 
still feel very confident about, particularly since we, if you recall, at that 
point, we were looking at two rate increases probably one in the middle of 
the year and one at the en
d of the year. And we have seen one happen in 
March so it clearly happened earlier and the data has been a little bit better 
then we expected. So my confidence in that guidance overall in NII is still 
very high. The lending growth in the wealth products wa
s good. As we said 
before, we would expect mortgage probably to slow, given the rising rate 
environment. But broadly speaking, the lending targets that we have are on 
track to provide the NII growth that we expect.

just generally on MiFID II, as you would expect, we have been preparing 
for quite some time for the implementation in the beginning at 2018. There 
are operational and implementation requirements and cost that go with that

effect. In terms of the impact, clearly when you have a change, there is 
probably the potential certainly early for disruption as people adjus
ted to the 
new rule.
 
In terms of how that affects market structure longer term and whether 

tell. But again, we are number one in the world in this business and we

an extensive network of offices and licenses across the EU 27. So we have 
options, se
veral options that will work once we understand what the ultimate 
outcome is. We've been in Europe for 50 years, it's an important market for 

London or from some other location.
 
I'm not
 
sure the election changes that. Certainly, doesn't change our 
analysis of it. It's clearly another risk event out there for people to focus on 
and concentrate on. But I don't think it changes much of our work and until 
the election happens, we're more imp
ortantly some of the negotiations are 
more advanced, it's really hard to tell you what the ultimate market 
structure and outlook is going to be.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim.
 
Andrew Lim
 
Just wanted a bit more 

coming through. You talked about the possibility to that you're on, but are 
you seeing any signs of having to pay any event or way to try and intensify 
deposit rates. And if not yet then maybe how do you e
xpect that at some 
point in the future? And how 
--
 
at what level would you expect that to turn 
towards maybe a third or maybe a 50% of the higher interest rates for that 
to be paid away?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
As I mentioned, Andrew, the deposit pricing, our depo

changed dramatically here so the actual beta has been lower than the model 
beta. And I said, we continue to model about 50% beta and we think that's a 
reasonable expectation. But ultimately we'll have to see what happens 
around customer 
behavior and competitive dynamics and see how it plays 
out over time.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier 
with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.

Just quick two on Wealth Manag
ement, so first one. Just on 
--
 
obviously, the 
trends have been strong, but just given you know what we've been seeing 
with the DOL in terms of delay and potentially it falls through. Just wanted 

ng any impact in 
either direction? And then just on the deposits, it seemed like that you've 
dipped down a bit in the quarter. I didn't know if you already covered that. 
But if there was anything that drove that versus the underlying growth that 
we've seen
 
long term.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So on DOL, we've been very consistent in saying that we want to provide our 
clients choice and we will continue to do that with compliance solutions if 
DOL goes into effect. And we're prepared if it does to go into effect to be 
compliant. We've had good momentum broadly in the business. And some of 
the secular changes and secular flows that we've seen continue around fee 
based assets and just benefits accruing to scale players. So I think all of that 
momentum is playing well in o
ur system, in our network. It probably has 
had a chilling effect on recruiting, attrition has been low. We are in attractive 
place to work and we've seen some good opportunities to bring in talent, so 

ll ultimately have to 
see if DOL gets implemented, delayed again, or ultimately, I guess shelved. 
On the second question, Michael [multiple speakers] BDP seasonality.
 
So it's obviously not a particularly large move but one of the comments I 
made about clie
nt engagement one of the ways that we gauge that metric is 
around what people are doing with their cash. So every quarter people 
receive dividend and interest. And periods of volatility around certainty, 
we've seen BDP balances grow, if people keep it in c
ash or take it out of the 
system. What we saw that quarter is significant investments and the 
dividend and interest going back into the market. We've seen some 
seasonality where that happens in the first quarter, both the combination of 
people putting that
 
money to work but also cap season. So nothing alarming 
and real stability in our deposit base

10/20/15,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During 

supplement and strategic updates, copies of which are available at 

presentation may include forward
-
looking 
statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual 
results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward
-
looking statements and non
-
GAAP measures that appear in the ea
rnings 
release and strategic updates. This presentation may not be duplicated or 
reproduced without our consent.
 
Within the strategic update our reported results for 2014 have been adjusted 
to exclude several significant intermittent items which were highl
ighted in 
our 2014 annual report on form 10
-
K. Likewise, our reported EPS and 
ROTCE metrics for 2019 have been adjusted to exclude the impact of 
intermittent net discrete tax benefits. These adjustments were made to 
provide a transparent and comparative vi
ew of 2014 and 2019 operating 
performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliation of these 
non
-
GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes 
to the presentation.
 
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Execu
tive Officer James 
Gorman.

was a strong year representing one of the best in our history. Results were 
within our target ranges with contributions from each of our 
business lines. 
John will discuss the details of 2019 in a moment but first let me take you 
through our annual strategic update presentation.
 

-
year 
increments. Over the first five y
ears period, we worked aggressively to clean 
up the issues from the financial crisis, stabilize the firm, integrated Smith 
Barney into our franchise and reset our strategy. Over the next five years 

digitalization, 
technology, talent and the balance sheet.
 
We grew revenues by 20% while we managed the expenses tightly, doubled 
net income and materially increased capital return. Our ROTCE now stands 
at nearly 13% and EPS is more than doubled excluding i
ntermittent discrete 
tax benefits.
 
Today, we will discuss the next phase of our evolution. The goal continues to 
be to shift our business further, emphasizing more durable sources of 
revenue within institutional securities and from wealth and investment 
ma
nagement. The continuation of this evolution should by design, help 
support a base level of profitability during periods of market disruption.
 
Drilling a little deeper into this throughout this decade long journey we 
defended and expanded our institutional
 
securities footprint which we show 
on the slide four. Our brand is closely tied to our institutional presence and 
leading integrated investment bank.
 
Our premier institutional franchise remains the key competitive advantage 
which has allowed us to take sh
are and grow revenues despite a shrinking 
wallet. At the same time the contribution from wealth and investment 
management continues to grow as shown on slide five.
 
Over the last five years, we have increased the profitability of our wealth 
management busin
ess while still making investments in the U.S. banks and 
our modern wealth platform. Of particular note, on nearly a 100% of 
business days we have revenues greater than or equal to $60 million nearly 
three times that which was five years ago.
 
We also inves
ted in our investment management platform. We put together 
a new growth
-
oriented leadership team and focused on clients, solutions and 
new products. We highlight the growth in long term net flows which reflects 
strong long
-
term performance. With combined r
evenues of approximately 
$21 billion our wealth and investment management businesses are among 
the largest platforms in the world and now we have an untapped opportunity 
to further scale our wealth management channel through our workplace 
offering.
 
Meeting
 
these ambitions for future growth would not be possible without a 
strong culture and a cohesive team.
 
On slide six, we described our culture and the tenure of our leadership team. 
We have an 8
-
year track record of stating and meeting various public goals.
 
We continue to invest meaningfully in our culture and diversity efforts to 
ensure we remain an employer of choice for our top talent and further 
Morgan Stanley has been at the forefront of sustainable finance.
 
We founded our global sustainable finance gro
up over a decade ago with the 
mission to accelerate the adoption of sustainable investing across capital 
markets.
 
I want to spend most of my time providing a bit more detail about the future 
opportunities we are excited about and that we see across our fra
nchise. 
Across our segments we have platforms with scale benefits and we're 
positioned for growth. Let's start with institutional securities on slide 7.
 
Our institutional footprint in franchise is extremely strong. In the phase of 
declining wallet, we've g
ained share over the last five years across our 
institutional businesses and we've reason to believe these gains are 
sustainable. Our business has benefited from the stability of the leadership 
and commitment to a global client footprint. We expect to cont
inue to hold 
and gain share across the division.
 
On slide 8, we take a deeper look at wealth management. 2020 marks a new 
chapter in our wealth management strategy.
 
The significant investments we make in the digital space, the acquisition of 
Solium positio
n us to efficiently service the mass [indiscernible] population 
and capture new clients and assets through the workplace.
 
Moreover, we can leverage the corporate relationships we've built through 
our institutional offering as we look to add new corporate c
lients. We've 
completed the Morgan Stanley at work offering to span beyond just share 
works by Morgan Stanley as stock plan and administration platform. We are 
enhancing diversity in our financial wellness and retirement offerings. This 
more fulsome suite 
of products allows us to deliver services to an even 
larger base of employees and this will help ensure that our touch points are 
not limited to stock plan participants.
 
As illustrated on this slide we're continuing to win new mandates. The 
combination the
 
state
-
of
-
the
-
art share works platform and the Morgan 
Stanley Wealth Management capabilities is being very well received in the 
marketplace. We expect to fully convert all of our existing corporate clients 
to the Morgan Stanley work model by the end of 202
1.
 
To
-
date nearly 40% of those plans on the legacy Morgan Stanley system 
have been transitioned to Shareworks and the remainder will be 

of our corporate clients will gain access to fi
nancial coaching, exclusive 
educational content and our self
-
directed brokerage offering providing them 
with an introduction to our wealth management services.
 
Over the next five to seven years we expect to convert over 1 million 
employee participants to e
ither wealth management digital or advisory 
channels adding to the more than 3 million client relationships we have 
today. We'll be able to provide a compelling offering for all our relationships 
servicing the ultra high and high net worth segments with fi
nancial advisors 
and more massive funds clients with our virtual adviser or digital solutions.
 
Moving to slide 9, we've been clear that we believe that supporting advisors 
for cutting
-
edge technology and enabling them to deliver unique product and 
set of s
ervices to clients will be our competitive advantage going forward. 
The investments we made with our digital initiatives have been embraced by 
our advisers and anecdotally these tools are supporting asset consolidation.
 
Additionally, of course we've seen o
ver 250 billion of assets flows in advisory 
over the last four years and continue to believe that at least half of our client 
assets will migrate to advisory over the medium term.
 
Let's talk about investment management on slide 10. The asset 
management sec
tor is both very large and extremely fragmented lending 
itself to opportunities for growth in areas where we believe we can deliver 
differentiated value to our clients and to me one of the most exciting things 
we've done to capture this opportunity is prod
uct innovation illustrated by 
the number of new products we've developed.
 
These products have broadened our revenue base, made us more relevant 
across the client spectrum and translated into material, revenue and asset 
growth.
 
Since 2016 we've launched man
y new products successfully leveraging a 
global client franchise. We've already seen significant contribution from 
these products generating $19 billion of incremental assets under 
management and almost $500 million of incremental revenue in 2019 versus 
20
16. These strategies continued new product launches and investments in 
our client franchise more broadly will be a very important component of 
future growth.
 
Another key driver of growth is our existing diverse alternatives client 
franchise. If you see 
on slide 11 our alternative client platform is at scale 
and there is strong secular growth in private alternatives. In addition to new 
private alternative product launches noted on the prior page we're seeing 
strong organic growth in our existing high
-
perf
orming private funds.
 
For example, our infrastructure number 3 fund which closed in the fourth 
quarter is over 50% larger than infrastructure 2 raising $5.5 billion of 
institutional capital versus $3.6 billion respectively.
 
Further, we continue to see very
 
strong organic growth in our premier 
institutional core real estate strategy. Our alpha products across both private 
and public markets as well as our world
-
class global solutions capabilities will 
be critical contributors to investment management's reven
ue growth. Our 
public active equity strategies has strong performance and global client 
footprint has driven robust net flows. We believe we ranked number 1 in 
organic growth since 2017 among the top publicly traded active equity 
managers.
 
So let's turn to
 
slide 12. We expect that these and all our other growth 
initiatives along with expense discipline will drive further ROTCE expansion. 
In 2015, we communicated that we believe we were capital sufficient. Since 
that time we've continued to deploy our capita
l to meet our strategic 
objectives.
 
We look forward to the transition to the new capital regime and expect 
Morgan Stanley will be able to return excess capital to shareholders while 
continuing to invest for future growth. Our robust capital position will e
nable 
us to pursue opportunities to invest in the franchise and return in capital. 
We're confident in our ability to deliver 2
-
year ROTCE expansion at 13% to 
15%.
 
I'll conclude with our updated strategic objectives. The targets we expect to 
achieve in 2021
 
as well as our longer
-
term aspirational targets are shown on 
slide 13.
 
We've meaningfully and with intent transform this business into what it is 
today. As we execute on the next phase of the firm's journey the objectives 
listed here assuming a normal mar
ket environment should result as a 
natural consequence. We believe that in 2021 wealth management will be a 
28% to 30% pre
-
tax margin business and will exceed 30% over time.
 
This business has compelling scale benefits. Between our core competency 
of servin
g ultra high and high net worth individuals and our new expansion 
into the workplace there is clearly room to grow from here.
 
On wealth management we're making numerous investments across all of 
our platforms to enhance the digitalization of our firm and o
verall 
technological capabilities given our scale and other efficiencies. We have 
largely been able to self
-
fund these investments.
 
Between this and revenue growth we expect to achieve an efficiency ratio 
70% to 72% in 2021 and below 70 in the long term.
 
A
s a result of these and all the other efforts we expect our return on tangible 
common equity to rise to 13% to 15% in 2021 and over the long term we 
aspire to have a return on tangible common equity of 15% to 17%.
 
Given our established track record our com
petitive positioning now continues 
to invest into our business, we're confident in our ability to achieve each of 
these objectives. I will now turn the call over to Jon who will discuss our 
fourth quarter and annual results and then together we would take 
all of 
your questions. Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you and good morning. The firm produced a record level of revenues 
in 2019. We had strong momentum through the quarter and finished the 
year on solid ground. In the fourth quarter firm revenues were $
10.9 billion 
increasing 8% sequentially contributing to full
-
year revenues of $41.4 
billion. Fourth
-
quarter PBT was $2.7 billion and EPS was $1.30 resulting in 
an ROE of 11.3% and ROTCE of 13%.
 
In the fourth quarter severance expenses of $172 million relat
ed to a 
December employee action and intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $158 
million largely offset each other. For the full year ROE was 11.7% and 
ROTCE was 13.4%.
 
Total non
-
interest expenses were $30.1 billion for the year. Non
-
compensation expens
es were essentially flat to 2018 at $11.3 billion 
demonstrating our ability to self fund incremental costs related to absorbing 
and integrating Solium and increased technology investments through 
continued discipline over our more controllable expenses par
ticularly 
marketing and business development and professional services.
 
We continue to actively review efficiency opportunities including optimization 
of our global workforce through reduced dependence on contingent workers 
and leveraging our global in
-
hou
se centers. We also see opportunities for 
vendor consolidation across the firm over time.
 
This focus will result in continued momentum to control our non
-
compensation expenses and help us achieve the objectives that James just 
discussed. Compensation expen
ses increased 7% on a full
-
year basis. This 
rise included severance charges and significant movements and deferred 
compensation plans as well as increased revenues. Our full
-
year expense 
efficiency ratio was 72.7% below our 73% target.
 
Now to the businesse
s. Our institutional securities business reported 
revenues of $5.1 billion marking the best fourth quarter in over 10 years. 
Results were driven by strength in investment banking especially advisory.
 
Additionally, we did not see the seasonal slowdown in sa
les and trading or 
underwriting typical of a fourth quarter. For the full year ISG revenues were 
$20.4 billion slightly below last year's record level.
 
The compensation ratio for the quarter rose to 40.7% reflecting a $124 
million of severance related to t
he December action and the impacts of 
movements in investments associated with employee deferred compensation 
plans.
 
After considering the impact of these items the fourth
-
quarter compensation 
ratio was approximately 36% and looking at the full year again 
after 
considering these adjustments the compensation ratio was under 35%.
 
DCP creates some volatility in this ratio but as we have said many times in 
the past it has a very limited impact to the bottom line.
 
Investment banking had the strongest fourth
-
quar
ter in a decade generating 
revenues of $1.6 billion. The sequential increase was driven by strengthened 
advisory and seasonally robust results for underwriting.
 
Overall, pipelines are healthy across products. The pace of M&A remains 
strong and we would exp
ect the period of activity to extend. The global 
equity pipeline remains robust as many issuers target capital raises in the 
first half of 2020 particularly across healthcare, consumer and technology. 
As we said before the conversion from pipeline to reali
ze remains dependent 
on market condition.
 
In equity sales and trading we retained our leadership position and our 
number one globally for the sixth consecutive year. Fourth
-
quarter revenues 
were $1.9 billion down 4% sequentially. Strengths in the Americas 
was 
offset by declines in EMEA and Asia.
 
In cash we continued to expand our share across regions which partially 
offset the impact of global market volumes. Prime brokerage performed well 
as client activity rose during the quarter with equity markets trend
ing higher 
and derivative revenues declined sequentially as lower volatility weighed on 
results. Fixed income sales and trading produced revenues of $1.3 billion, 
down 11% from a robust third quarter.
 
We continue to deepen our relationships with our client
 
base. Results were 
driven by strong performance across the credit complex. Micro produced 
another solid quarter with well diversified performance. Healthy levels of 
client engagement supported results.
 
We continue to invest in our secured lending 
businesses which perform well 
and witnessed increased client interest from commercial real estate 
products.
 
Balance sheet velocity remains a focus in this business and on a full
-
year 
basis improved from the prior year. Macro results declined versus the thi
rd 
quarter due to lower client activity. Commodities revenues also declined 
sequentially. However, client activity and further geographical diversification 
of the revenue mix supported results. On a full year basis fixed income was 
up 11%. Strong performan
ce in micro outweighed the decline in macro 
where a difficult environment weighed on results in FX and rates.
 
Turning to Wealth Management. We reported fourth quarter revenues of 
$4.6 billion and pre
-
tax profit of $1.2 billion resulting in a PBT margin for
 
the 
quarter of 25.4% Strong revenues were offset by higher seasonal expenses 
as well as a $37 million severance charge which had an 80 basis point 
impact on the margin.
 
On a full
-
year basis the PBT margin was 27.2% representing a 100 basis 
point expansion
 
over the last year. The business continues to illustrate the 
benefits of scale while investing in this business and absorbing the Solium 
expenses, non
-
compensation expenses declined 3% from 2018.
 
Transactional revenues were $829 million, up 39% sequential
ly. Results 
were principal driven by gains in investments associated with employee 
deferred compensation plans as well as improved retail engagement.
 
Asset management revenues were essentially flat versus the prior quarter. 
On a full year basis asset manag
ement revenues were also flat as a large 
market decline in Q4 2018 impacted first quarter results.
 
Total clients assets of $2.7 trillion increased 5% sequentially and 17% 
versus the prior year reflective of broader market movements.
 
Over the last several y
ears we have seen net new assets of approximately 
4% of beginning period client assets. While these flows are an indicator of 
the health of the business we continue to believe fee
-
based flows are more 
relevant driver of near
-
term results. We had $25 billio
n of fee
-
base flows in 
the fourth quarter; a record. The shift towards advisory continued and fee
-
based assets now represent 47% of total client assets, up from 45% last 
year.
 
Loan growth continues to be strong across products. Lending balances 
increased t
o $80 billion or 11% versus the prior year. We continue to see 
strong receptivity in our lending offering.
 
Our investments into technology have better enabled our advisors to identify 
clients who would benefit from our lending product suite. This has been 
especially effective in securities based lending.
 
We expect to continue to see strong receptivity resulting in loan growth of 
mid
-
single digits in 2020. Total deposits rose 5% sequentially. Within our 
bank deposit program we have seen stable deposit level 
since May with a 
seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in new banking 
products and our high yield savings product has also continued to gain 
traction. Our new money savings campaign has raised close to $14 billion 
since its March lau
nch.
 
Net interest income was in line with last quarter. On a full
-
year basis NII was 
up slightly including the impact of prepayment amortization. Over the next 
year we would expect the full impact of 2019 three rate cuts, the realization 
of the forward cur
ve and the continued diversification of our deposits to 
offset the benefit of our lending growth.
 
As James discussed we will continue to invest in our workplace offering and 
also build out our U.S. banks to drive further growth. That being said we 
would ex
pect the margin to rebound nicely in Q1 from its fourth quarter 
seasonal low.
 
Investment management reported revenue of $1.4 billion in the fourth 
quarter. For the full year's revenues were $3.8 billion representing a $1 
billion increase from the prior per
iod.
 
Total AUM rose 9% to $552 billion of which long
-
term AUM was $356 billion. 
We continued to generate strong positive net flows across major high 
conviction active strategies. Long
-
term net flows were $6.7 billion the 
strongest in 8 years and we had ano
ther strong capital raising year capped 
off with the close of our $5.5 billion infrastructure 3 fund.
 
Asset management fees is $736 million, grew 11% versus the third quarter. 
Recall a significant amount of performance fees are recognized in the fourth 
qua
rter. Performance fees for the quarter were driven by strong results in 
our core real estate strategy and management fees increased on higher 
average AUM.
 
On a full year basis asset management fees increased 7% to $2.6 billion. 
Investment revenues were up 
$565 million in the quarter and $1 billion for 
the year. This line is primarily driven by carried interest which is earned 
from clients who are invested in private funds. The increase this quarter and 
year was primarily due to an underlying investment IPO 
subject to sales 
restrictions within Asia private equity fund. This event generated a 
significant amount of accrued interest revenue, the ultimate realization of 
which will depend on the monetization of the underlying position and the 
fund. As we have prev
iously said this line is lumpy.
 
Other revenues were impacted by an impairment of a legacy equity method 
investment and a third party asset manager.
 
Total expenses increased 52% sequentially. In particular higher 
compensation costs are reflective of higher 
accrued carried interest 
compensation which was primarily related to the event I just discussed.
 
Non
-
compensation expenses were driven by higher BC&E expenses related 
to the launching of new products and reflecting our continued investment 
into this busine
ss. This business continues to grow and we expect it will be 
an increasingly meaningful contributor to total firm earnings. We continue to 
look for organic and inorganic opportunities to grow this business and to 
effectively meet the needs of our clients.
 
During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately $31 million shares 
or $1.5 billion of common stock and our board declared a $0.35 dividend per 
share.
 
After considering $158 million and $348 million of intermittent net discrete 
tax benefits, our tax 
rates were 21.4% and 21.3% for the fourth quarter and 
full year respectively. We expect our 2020 tax rate to be slightly higher or 
approximately 22% to 23% and will exhibit some quarter
-
to
-
quarter 
volatility.
 
Take it in full we are pleased with the firm's 
results this year. We entered 
2020 with asset levels at new highs, healthy pipelines, constructive markets, 
engaged clients and a right sized expense base.
 
With that we will now open up the line to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you.
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn 
Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thanks very much. Just curious within your two
-
year objectives what 
particularly on the ROTCE what capital return 
assumptions are incorporated 
into that? Is that steady state now or any changes from what we've seen the 
last couple of years?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, again just from a technical standpoint says we haven't seen the new 
proposals which we think are forthcoming. 
It's sort of hard to say what the 
future return profile looks like other than it will be consistent with we've 
done prior until we have more information.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. Fair enough. On the gain in that investment management I guess IPO 
out of a private
 
equity fund I'm assuming there's a standard lockup and 
illiquidity discount. Can you tell us what that company is, so we can track it, 
so we don't have surprise ups and downs every quarter?
 
James Gorman
 
I'll give you some more information on that but firs
t I clarified there's no 
illiquidity discount there. The company is public and it's marked to the stock 
price on a daily basis. And you mentioned it is in the Asia one of our Asia PE 

fun
d made more than six years ago into a China consumer products 
company. The company has been quite successful and grown quite nicely 
and it went public in the fourth quarter on the Hong Kong exchange and the 
IPO has performed quite nicely.
 
To give you some 
sort of context around the round numbers the investment 

is approximately $2 billion. So we have not only the carried interest we also 
have a small LP investment in the fund and so t
he ownership and carry is 
going to be fluctuating until we have the underlying investment monetized.
 
So as of today we're comfortably above the preferred return threshold in 
that fund but as I said before it's an unrealized gain. So we'll have more 
volatil
ity if there is volatility in the stock price.
 
So just to sum up given the size and given that it's public we would expect a 
little bit more volatility in that investment line and IM and we would also 
expect corresponding volatility in the IM compensation 
line as the 
investment team has about half of the carry typically.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. 
Your line is now open.
 
Christian Bolu
 

 
recently made some changes to the comp grid that should be beneficial to 
wealth management margins selling next year. I think the question is 
longer
-
term, can you keep pulling the comp lever? And I guess as I look at 
the industry and what's happened over 
the last decade whether it's in a 
white house consolidation the demise of the broker protocol, more client 
stickiness because of lending and technology it feels like you can do that, 
but for the curiosity your thoughts on, using the grid to drive margins o
ver 
time?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well, I'll take that. We're not using the grid to drive margins. We use the 
grid to drive behavior to help us do a better job with our clients. So most of 
the changes of the grid over the last decade have been designed to do 
exact
ly that. They have supported asset based accounts, they have 
supported working with more sophisticated complex clients. They've 
supported larger producers who have been growing their business.
 
So I don't think of the grid as an expense item. I think of the
 
grid as frankly 
what really reflects what we're trying to do with the business and the best 
advisors embrace that and great stability among the top advisors as a result 
of that.
 
So Christian the changes this year were modest but within the changes that 
ar
e under the covers there are more significant changes as you move 
compost effectively from one set of behaviors to another and ultimately the 
goal is to continue to professionalize the financial advisor workforce which is 
a fantastic group of people and be
ing transformed in the last decade from 
producing something like 300,000 revenue go over a million revenue per 
person and the grids got to be aligned with their interests as well and that's 
something Andy and the team are very focused on.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Ok
ay. Thanks. Maybe just to get back to the question I think Glen asked 
earlier on because the ROTCE target does stand out, the 15%
-
17%. It does 
catch one's eye. Can you just maybe just help clarify like what level of 
capital you assumed? Do you assume like 
the absolute dollar of capital level 
will go down over time and that's how you get to 15% to 17% just it would 
be great to get that sort of like clarification.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. I'm probably going to disappoint you Christian and not you exactly what 
you'll
 
need for your model to produce that answer. We run the business 
based upon a myriad of things that we see from global economic growth to 
market share we have in each of our businesses to the capital we're using to 
prosecute our earnings in those businesse
s, our ability to drive efficiencies 
across the group, net of investments that we're making and we're currently 
running an ROTCE around 13% and so the two
-
year objectives feel like 
there's no compelling reason why we'd go below that.
 
In any individual quar
ter of course these things bounce around as you've 
seen in numbers over many, many years but over that time period we think 
the 13 to 15 is a very reasonable expectation and assuming normal market 
condition we would deliver on that.
 
For the longer
-
term asp
irations really speaking the way we see embedded 
scale we have in our various businesses what the longer
-
term growth 
projections looks like our ability to manage our expenses you will see non
-
comp year
-
over
-
year are essentially flat this year which [immens

pretty impressive given that we are investing in lot of parts of the business.
 
So if you just roll the math forward and make reasonable capital 
assumptions you get to those ROTCE numbers of 15% to 17%. There is as 
always through the [seeker] on t
he capital process a kind of wildcard how 
much do you ask for? What's the stock trading at when you're doing your 
buy backs, do increase the dividend? Are we going to make other 
acquisitions or investments along the way. There are a lot of things that 
driv
e the longer term, but what we're trying to set when we set longer term 
is what do we believe the potential for this business is?
 
Many many years ago when our wealth management margins were around 
10% or 11%, we set a target of 15% and I said publicly, I t
hought I could 
get 20% and obviously we exceeded that and the whole transformation 
business helped on that.
 
Many years ago we set our ROE target of 10% when I think our ROE was 
around 2% or 4% and we were constantly asked on this call when are you 
going to
 
get there like, the kids in the back seat in the car saying when are 
we going to get there, when are we going to get there and we kind of got 
there and our feeling now is there's no compelling reason with normal 
economic growth and good discipline around 
expense management and the 
embedded scale in their businesses and the strength of the culture why 
these return shouldn't be achievable over a longer term period.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your 
line is now 
open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Question on the pre
-
tax 
margin target here in wealth over the next two years. Good to see, you guys 
expect a nice step up. Could you talk a little about the market and revenue 
assumptions e
mbedded within that target and at this point you guys seemed 
to have implied generally, especially with your comments just a minute ago 
James that about non
-
comp, flattening out here in 2019, we should be 
expecting self
-
funding of an investment and a more 
stability in the non
-
comp as opposed to the growth of prior years. Is that fair?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
There's a couple of questions in there. I think when we think about our 
budgets we generally use conservative consensus views on markets and 
rates and that's w
hat we've done here. The 28% to 30% margin target as 
you said is a nice improvement and continues to trend. It also gives us the 
flexibility to continue to invest in this business which we will continue to do 
around our Shareworks platform in the Morgan St
anley at work. We've done 
a lot of work around the digitalization which James talked about which is 
critically important to the customer experience and the client experience and 
will continue to make investments there. And so I don't think there's any 
outs
ized expectations around markets or rates just what we see in the 
consensus you going forward.
 
James Gorman
 

fourth quarter and somebody probably ask us about itself address a write
-
u
p 
was 25 and change some seasonality. We had some severance expenses in 
there, DCP and other stuff. So as I said before these things will bounce 
around quarter
-
to
-
quarter. I can't guarantee where the first quarter is going 
to be, the second quarter, third 
quarter but over a full year where [27.2] 
with normal economic growth what we've done with the business I think that 
28% I've been disappointed if we know that that I just put that out there.
 
It can be higher than that. That's why we put a range on it. Do 
we think it's 
going to be over 30% the next two years? No we do not. And I think we've 
got to be responsible when we set these targets about what we think is a 
likely outcome not a three standard deviation outcome. What is the likely 
outcome and coming off
 
a 27.2 margin 26.2, I think the year before 
approximately 25, it's kind of grinding high. Why is it grinding high? Well, as 
you bring incremental revenues in the incremental margin on the 
incremental dollar revenue is higher than the embedded margin. So w
ill 
grind higher.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Clearly, Solium should also, the Solium 
acquisition and integration should also up to, appreciate that. I think you 
made reference James in those comments too what the underlying margin 
migh
t have been in the fourth quarter. I know I think John you said 80 basis 
points from severance and wealth. So that gets you to 27.
 
There was some DCP but I don't think you talked about what impact that 
would have had on the wealth management margin. If you
 
could please let 
us know that and just a request maybe I know it doesn't impact the bottom 
line but the DCP creates some noise around some of the underlying metrics 
which makes it, it can bore investor visibility into the underlying trends. It'd 
be really
 
helpful if you could disclose that or consider disclosing that going 
forward?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. So just I appreciate the comment and we continue to give further 
thought to that but we do give a reasonable amount of disclosure in the 
[indiscernible] aro
und that we try to highlight it to you when it's a 
meaningful contributor based on meaningful swings in the marketplace 
across all the businesses as I said before the PBT impact is not material 
generally speaking a dollar revenue versus a dollar of comp ex
pense.
 
Your fourth quarter comment though we generated 25.4 I think you said 
with the 80 basis points we'd be at 27 obviously we'd be a 26.2 and then by 
definition when you look at all of these ratios they are negatively impacted 
by that dynamic is effecti
vely one for one. It's not precise but that's what we 
simplify have been using and again appreciate the comment and we'll give it 
some thought but we obviously feel very comfortable with the new targets 
that we laid out at 28 to 30 on that margin.
 
James Go
rman
 
Brennan you make a good point. It creates noise, I mean I remember the 
old days when we used to have to deal with DBA on these calls which should 
move I think one year moved $6 billion and the sort of bizarre impact it had 
on our financials. Fortunate

DCP, I mean the funny thing is it's kind of a good news story. You actually 
want it to be messing with the numbers like this in a positive way because it 
means the stock has done well which people invested in 
and the markets are 
doing well. This was here where what was the S&P was up 25 and the stock 
was up 28%
-
29 %. So pretty unusual year and that's why I think we're 
seeing the outsized on this year. I wouldn't, I mean listen if that happens in 
2020 I'll be de
lighted and I don't mind the noise if we get that outcome but 
I'll leave it to the accounting and controlling team to figure out what the 
right disclosures are but that's where we are.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wol
fe 
Research. Your line is now open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Hi, good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So appreciated some of the additional disclosure on the wealth management 
conversion targets from Shareworks. Certainly that's an area where there 
is 
significant interest post a Solium deal. I recognize it's a 5 to 7 year goal. So 
you certainly have a lot of time to execute on that conversion target. I was 
just hoping that you can maybe help us frame how we can think about either 
the incremental reve
nue or even just AUM growth opportunity over that 
horizon, if you ultimately execute on that goal and just separately do you 
expect the pace of on
-
boarding to be somewhat linear or is it going to be 
more back
-
end loaded?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Let me try to answe
r that. I mean a couple of things. One first of all we had 
Solium was only in our results for 8 months this year. I think we mentioned 
before that it was diluted to PBT. So obviously diluted to margin. We will 
have the full effect of the acquisition this y
ear which will also be diluted to 
margin and to PBT and then we would expect it to turn potentially PBT 
neutral or positive and then to build over time and improve the margin.
 
The conversions are those several stages as James mentioned there's just 
making 
sure that we get all of the corporate clients onto the Shareworks 
platform that's accelerating. That should be done this year and then 
integrating it into the Morgan Stanley at work platform will take another 
year. I think we'll see sort of an acceleration
 
a slow build if you will of 
converting our Morgan Stanley at work clients into either the digital or 
advisory channel but we think a million incremental customers on our 
current base would be quite attractive and a real nice growth engine.
 
Obviously, the 
potential for the different dynamics around the size of that 
client i.e. was whether it's mass affluent versus ultra high
-
net
-
worth or high 
net
-
worth will have an impact, the asset levels and cash levels and net new 
assets but again incrementally if we thi
nk we can bring on another million 
customers in five to seven years on top of our current existing base, it's why 
we're so excited about the opportunity.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Got it and just one follow
-
up for me. I was hoping you could speak to some 
of the 
underlying assumptions just specifically on the macro and maybe 
industry fee pool outlooks particularly on trading and IB just supporting 
some of the near and long
-
term return objectives?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'm sorry. Trading, what did you say?
 
Steven Chubak
 
Trading and investment banking people as well as just some of the 
underlying macro assumptions underlying some of the return targets.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. Again, so I think that we will obviously have to see where the pools 
come out this year when everyone
 
finishes reporting and we get the data. It 
looks like the pools are pretty stable. I think from a budgeting standpoint we 
generally think about those types of pools growing with sort of GDP. So sort 
of very limited or sort of a couple of percentage point 
type growth in the 
pool and then we couple that with our view on investment dollars and share 
and share points. So that's generally the macro backdrop that we use for the 
budgeting which will obviously track consensus views on GDP and U.S. 
growth and so on
 
and so forth.
 
James Gorman
 
Now just to add I mean we don't talk ironically as much about the 
institutional securities business which is sort of been at core and our lineage 
since our founding 85 years ago but in each of that we have a slide in there 
that 
shows in each of the five businesses debt underwriting, equity 
underwriting, advisory M&A equities and fixed income they were able to gain 
share over that five
-
year period and this year they delivered their fourth 
consecutive $5 billion revenue quarter and
 
we've never had a year where 
we've had for $4 billion, $5 billion I mean what this business has been 
characterized by at least one and sometimes two pretty volatile and difficult 
quarters each year.
 
Now we can't and it's obviously more vulnerable to marke
t swings but I 
think what the team has done in balancing out the business, [trading] group 
have made it a much more stable organization I think within fixed income 
the way that's been turned around with stability to Sam and his team. I see 
it gives us more
 
comfort that we've got a lot more stability embedded in the 
business from prime brokerage financing through to the M&A which remains 
very stable. Obviously, you're going to have volatility but we think these 
shares are sustainable. Some places we could gr
ow share but it's really a 
function of stability is what I'm very focused on for this business because the 
capital on the balance sheet shall we say is stable. It stays there. So we 
need the revenues to be stable and that's what they delivered.
 
Operator
 
Th
ank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your 
line is now open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Mike Mayo
 
I'm wondering if your minimum targets are high enough? Slide 7 through 11 
highlight what you expect institutional se
curity, the five
-
year share gain 
should continue, wealth management increase clients share by one
-
third, of 
the over longer time frame and that's management have new products you 
have digital initiatives non
-
comps flat. It's all going well and report a 13%
 
ROTCE last year and you're look for a minimum ROTCE of 13%. So why not 
raise that minimum [indiscernible]?
 
James Gorman
 
Mike we now go back a long way and I'd have to say you're a model of 
consistency. I think I'm not sure we've ever had a call when you h
aven't 
asked for higher targets and it had to feel defensive when we're talking 
about wealth management margins above 28% efficiencies at 70% plus and 
ROTCE at 13% to 15%.
 
Listen our job is to be as transparent and realistic as we can. These targets 
have o
ne significant caveat which is the markets. If the world collapses they 
will be very difficult to meet and we will not be the only financial institution 
struggling with meeting whatever public targets they have out there. We 
don't run this piece on the bas
is the world is about to collapse and we have 
no evidence that 2020 is going to be a difficult economic year, difficult 
politically potentially geopolitically but certainly the economic outlook 
remains very, very stable.
 
So when we do the math and put the 
targets together we do it based upon a 
balance between what is that downside in a normal scenario and what is a 
realistic upside of the near
-
term. Longer
-
term that's great. That's sort of it's 
fun and it's interesting and it's sort of saying what could we 
deliver 
aspirationally and that's probably where your head is in the longer term part 
of that chart the right hand side but in terms of running the business and in 
terms of thinking to our capital deployment and dividend strategy, 
compensation all of our i
nvestments that we're making we really focus 
frankly on the two
-
year objectives and what I've always tried to do with 
these target is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should 
be able to deliver in all normal circumstances.
 
The top of the
 
range is obviously a little more sporty. So listen, I would love 
for us to deliver on your more aspirational views each year but we can't 
reliably project that. So I don't think we should reliably project it and if a few 
folks want to model in different n
umbers that's obviously your decisions but 
we've got to do what we think is right.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And just to follow up slide 7 and 8 one is the expectation to continue to gain 
share. I get the share gained from the European banks but your expectation 
for that 
to continue and then on the wealth management side going to the 
mass affluent, you're going down market to the teeth of the Schwab's zero 
commission for wealth and after a number of years of kind of moving back 
from the lower end clients. So just if you co
uld address those two specific 
areas? Thanks.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. Well, I think the way we use for sustainable share we certainly don't 
see our share going backwards in these businesses and there is clearly and 
different parts of the institutional business w
e think we can gain share in 
certain regions in the world where we're looking forward to getting our full 
China license there and continue to grow out our Asia presence for example. 
So I feel good about these share numbers. You point out there are differen
t 
parts of the industry that are going through larger transitions now but kinds 
of things we were doing several years ago. So there is potential share 
upside. No question about that. We can't model that because that would be 
that would be pretty aggressive
 
but you can certainly, we certainly affirmed 
they share we have now with us is stable.
 
Normal market environment growth that obviously translates into higher 
revenues and we think there's some upside on share. On the going down 
market I think about differently and for sure commission pricing has been 
going to zero in small trades for a long 
time and there have been examples 
of that in the digital space for years. I think the move that Schwab made 
just accelerated what was something that had been happening for a long 
time and their business models are not built around their secondary 
commissio
n revenues. That you and I understand. I don't think about this so 
much is going down market. I think it is about it is opening up a new 
segment to Morgan Stanley.
 
There are basically three ways in which people have their wealth managed, 
one is through som
e sort of a advice whether it's full
-
service private bank, 
trust bank, independent financial planner, financial advisors and so on and 
we're very dominant in that space.
 
The second is direct digital and there are a whole set of new platforms but 
there are 
some very established at scale players in that space and the third 
is the workplace and the workplace remains, there are certain players who 
have been very dominant in it but we think this is also a very interesting 
space.
 
Solium gave us a leg into it. We 
see a lot of financial wellness, financial 
base, financial planning that can be brought to employees if they're into a 
default digital account when their stock plans are best for example. That's 
sort of that's relatively easy for us to drive on a digital a
nd direct platform.
 
So I see it less sort of characterization is going down market and more 
characterization it's just expanding the universe of clients. There are a lot of 
people out there working companies making good money through these 
share plans. The
y do not want or need one of our large financial advisor 
teams. That's for sure. But that doesn't mean they can't have access to what 
Morgan Stanley can deliver.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche 
Bank. Your line i
s now open.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Good morning. I realize you don't want to give all the details on the expense 
of adjustments related the deferred comp but I guess I'm trying to get a 
sense of the kind of full
-
year efficiency ratio of 73 as I think about kind of 
getting the 70
-
72. It woul
d be helpful if you give us kind of the clean base 
for this year either now or I guess it's probably coming the K but it would be 
helpful just to get that base and I guess my question is if you don't do that 
really just as we think about the efficiency imp
rovement, can you just 
elaborate a bit on the drivers? Obviously, it's a little bit of revenue growth as 
you talked about a little bit of growth and [wallet] and from the efforts to 
wealth but just maybe elaborate on is there opportunity to bring the comp 
rate down and on the non
-
comp is it about keeping it flat or there's some 
opportunities to cut on an absolute basis. Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So I think I've given the comment and we've given the comments and we 
hear you on the DCP, so I'm just going to 
focus you can see from our targets 
that we've lowered the efficiency ratio.
 
We had a little bit of severance in there and again the DCP adjustment 
would also impact that ratio slightly but I think when we think about 
expenses and expense discipline we're t
alking about expense discipline 
across all categories of expenses both comp and non
-
comp.
 
We allocate resources at the firm level which is why we have a firm 
efficiency ratio target. Some of these ratios get a lot of attention to them 
when they are if you 
think about the comp ratio with an ISG that's only 40% 
or less than 40% of our comp versus the totality of the firm.
 
We constantly have been focused on being disciplined on comp and non
-
comp. What we will say is that we have been disciplined on comp. The o
nly 
thing is that we continue to try to do and we have done quite successfully is 
to pay our people competitively across all of our businesses as we try to 
attract and retain talent but we're disciplined across all those categories 
when we get to the non
-
c
omps we've been very focused on professional 
services as we've grown our businesses and we've grown some of the digital 
and technology and digitalization of the firm as well as complying with the 

s and 
consultants to help us build out this practice and as all of that has matured 
and turn more into BAU we've been able to rely more efficiently on 
employees which is why you've seen the headcount grow even after the 
December action and so we've been ab
le to take out some expenses there 
and optimize the workforce.
 
I mentioned vendor consolidation. We've done data consolidation in the past. 
So we're constantly looking for opportunities in the non
-
comp space to 
continue to self fund and drive efficiencies 
and those types of categories are 
the ones that I would say that we'll continue to focus on in the future and we 
have finally seen some productivity gains around the significant investments 

f the 
actions we've taken as well.
 
James Gorman
 
I would just say something about the comp ratio and I think it's important to 
say it. Years ago when we started on this journey the ISG comp ratio was 
62% I think if memory serves me and wealth management I f
orgot what is 
but it was well in the 60s and we had a long term aspiration gate I think 
wealth management down to 55
-
57 and ultimately ISG to 40.
 
The last time we publicly set a comp ratio goal for ISG I think was in 2015 
which was 37% and we've managed in
 
the last three or four years to be 
under that, sometimes 34%. This past year was a little higher and we had 
some stuff going on as we've talked about but we also have started moving. 
We've had a lot of contractors and contingents around the world working 
for 
us tens of thousands actually and we've decided as part of our restructuring 
off
-
shoring we've moved some of those folks in as permanent employees 
and more stability with that we have heard a lot of reasons I don't need to 
go under this call that then 
becomes part of the comp pool.
 
So I don't want to be tied to a comp ratio when we really managing the firm 
for overall expenses. That's what we're going to manage for and there's a 
reason you're not seeing you comp ratios in these numbers but you're 
seeing
 
pretty aggressive efficiency ratio. We want the ability and manage 
the firm for shareholders on best basis and that's to have the best people 
working most efficiently.
 
So you will not see, you're never going to see comp ratios in the 40% in ISG 
and that's
 
it we're not going to do that but we just want to maintain 
flexibility to run the business and not do goofy stuff like not make 
contingents employees because we're worried it'll affect the comp ratio when 
in fact it brings down the non
-
comp ratio. So that
's we're going to run the 
business on that basis and we've been doing that for a couple of years but I 
just want to be explicit about it.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Okay. It's helpful color. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with 
Bank of 
America. Your line is now open.
 
Mike Carrier
 
Good morning. Just a quick one for me. Just an investment management. So 
you guys have done well from product development, I mean kind of growing 
that business. It does seem like on the private side, it'
s more of your assets. 
We can see it in the performance fees, in the carried interest. I don't know if 
you can quantify maybe how much of the AUM now you have the potential to 
generate your carrier performance fees? It's just something that's obviously 
har
d to model but you also probably don't get much credit for it because we 
don't have kind of the magnitude of that. So any more clarity around that 
would be useful.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I would again the different categories that we break out obviously the 
alter
natives generally are where we're going to have carried interest or 
performance fees. We try to give you some more information on that in the 
second, you know again it's hard to model because as we said there's some 
lumpiness to it, but we've had some real
ly good performance across all of 
the strategies within IM.
 
We've also seen stable fee rates across the platform. So as AUM has grown 
we've seen that fee base revenue number grow as again a year
-
over
-
year 
comparison that was up 7% which is quite 
healthy in this industry given 
what you're seeing across the complex. So again we've tried to give you the 
information to do it but as even with perfect information these things are 
very difficult to project and model out.
 
Mike Carrier
 
Okay. Thanks a lot.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital 
Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Hi guys this is a [Stephen Dong] is in for Gerard. Are there any products 

 
product areas within your businesses that you'
d like to compliment with 
acquisitions?
 
James Gorman
 
I don't think. I don't know that we can really talk about products and 
acquisitions. I mean there most of the product gaps we have we try and fill 
organically. Acquisitions we tend to do for broader stra
tegic reasons either 
build scale and business open up a new vertical expand geographically really 
would we do a significant acquisition or even a small acquisition on a pure 
product. It's more platform or a business unit. So I think the short answer is 
no.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
I understood. And just last question. We appreciate your targets for the next 
couple of years recognizing that you guys have changed considerably since 
the last time we've had a sustained bear market. Can you share with us the 
tools t
hat you'd use to mitigate revenue shortfalls that are likely in a bear 
market to try to help reach these goals should a bear market occur the next 
two or three years?
 
James Gorman
 
Expenses. I mean basically that's your tool, right? Good news is with the 
be
ar market your stocks low, you're buying back more shares, your EPS is 
growing because your shakeouts down a shakeout peaked at about 2 billion 
and we're around 1.6 now. So we bought back nearly I think nearly 100 
million net shares last year when the stoc
k was trading around 38 a couple 
of months ago. So that was a little gift that God gave us.
 
So I think it's just very hard to fight the market if you're in a sustainable 
bear market you got to restructure your organization to reflect that. You 
become small
er, more nimble and more efficient and we and all our 
competitors would have to go through that. You can't plan the business 
based upon a bear market obviously. You got to plan the business based 
upon a normal market not a bull market and that's where we s
et our goals 
from but as I've been very clear and I'll finish on this note these goals are 
always subject to a normal market environment. If we have an abnormal 
market environment one way or the other then the numbers will be what 
they'll be but they proba
bly won't be what's on this page.

James P. Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with 
Ruth to 
discuss our first quarter results today. There were several significant 
highlights in the quarter, but it's important to remind you of some of the 
steps we've taken to reach this point. For the past 2 years, our team has 
systematically executed in a number
 
of areas including: selling certain 
assets and eliminating legacy positions to move beyond the crisis; rebuilding 
and investing in the client footprint in Institutional Securities, implementing 
the MSSB integration; increasing fee
-
based assets and improvi
ng the profit 
margin in that business; deepening and strengthening our partnership with 
MUFG; building and maintaining a conservative capital, liquidity and leverage 
profile; and finally, not unimportantly, maintaining strong expense discipline. 
While this
 
has been a long and at times, arduous journey, our results this 
quarter are evidence we're on the right track. Ruth will take you through the 
GAAP results in detail, but let me underscore a few things.
 
x DVA, our revenue, net earnings, EPS and ROE for the
 
quarter were among 
the highest since the financial crisis. ROE was over 9%. IC revenues were 
particularly strong with significant progress in Fixed Income, driven by 
improved balance sheet velocity and VAR efficiency. This was coupled with 
continued stren
gth in equities despite challenging markets. We reached an 
important milestone in the quarter with the successful move for the first 
wave of legacy Smith Barney Advisors to our new technology platform, with 
the rest to follow in early May and early July. W
e are just 11 weeks away 
from completion of this integration.
 
Our strategic partnership with MUFG continues to grow as we deepen client 
relationships and leverage our combined balance sheet to deliver financial 
solutions. Finally, we have delivered on the 
promise of expense control. 
We're disciplined in the approach to compensation, and while overall 
compensation expense rose, of course, with higher revenues, the actions 
we've taken in the last few years, we meaningfully reduced the ratio, 
striking a balanc
e between driving ROE and investing in the franchise.
 
Similarly, our rigorous non
-
compensation expense program allowed us to 
keep a tight rein on spending, and thus, drove significant operating 
leverage. Clearly, we still have work to do to reach our goals
, and I believe 
the progress we have made further underscores the strength of this 
franchise globally. I'll now turn it over to Ruth to take you through our 
earnings in detail.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. To provide greater transparency into our results, I wi
ll 
provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We will 
present our results this way, whether the impact is positive or negative, and 
have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to 
reconcile these non
-
GAAP m
easures. DVA in the quarter was negative $2 
billion with $381 million in equity sales and trading and $1.6 billion in Fixed 
Income sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues 
were $8.9 billion, up 24% sequentially, excluding the impa
ct of the MBIA 
settlement in the fourth quarter. Noninterest expenses were $6.7 billion, up 
10% versus the fourth quarter.
 
Compensation expenses of $4.4 billion this quarter included approximately 
$138 million related to severance. Non
-
compensation expense
s were $2.3 
billion, down 2% from last quarter, reflecting firm
-
wide cost
-
containment 
efforts.
 
Income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders was approximately $1.3 billion. Net income from continuing 
operations per dilu
ted share was $0.71 after preferred dividends.
 
On a reported or [ph] GAAP basis, firm
-
wide revenues for the first quarter 
were $6.9 billion, up 22% sequentially. Income from continuing operations 
applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders was a loss 
of 
approximately $103 million, and the reported net loss from continuing 
operations per diluted share was $0.05 after preferred dividends.
 
Book value at the end of the quarter was $30.74 per share. Tangible book 
value was $27.37 per share. Subsequent to th
e end of the quarter, we 
closed on the sale of Quilter and the first phase of the Saxon disposition.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $781 billion at March 31, up 
from $750 billion last quarter, reflecting increased client activity. Our 
liqu
idity pool was $179 billion at the end of the quarter. Although our 
calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under 
Basel I will be approximately 13.2%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be 
approximately 16.8%. Risk
-
weighted asset
s under Basel I are expected to 
be approximately $319 billion at March 31. Subject to final rule
-
making, our 
Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was between 8% and 9% pro forma as 
of the end of the first quarter, assuming full Basel III inflation of RWAs a
nd 0 
benefit from mitigation. We're in the range as a function of the ultimate 
revolution around Basel 2.5 NPR. We expect that our Tier 1 common ratio 
under Basel III at the end of 2012 will approach 10%, reflecting passive 
mitigation driven by position ro
ll off and consensus earnings.
 
Now turning to our businesses in detail. Unless otherwise noted, all 
discussion of income statement metrics and segment results will exclude 
DVA for the remainder of my remarks in order to differentiate revenues 
associated wi
th our business from those associated with our borrowings that 
result solely from our credit spreads.
 
In Institutional Securities, revenues were $5 billion. Excluding the impact of 
the MBIA loss last quarter, revenues were up 39% sequentially. Noninterest 
expenses were $3.3 billion, up 17% versus the fourth quarter. The 
compensation ratio is 42% in the quarter. Non
-
compensation expenses 
declined 5% from last quarter. The business reported a pretax profit of $1.7 
billion.
 
Our Investment Banking results refle
ct the backdrop of continued low 
market activity, resulting in revenues of $851 million, down 4% versus last 
quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in global 
IPOs and #2 in global completed M&A and global announced M&A at the end 
o
f the first quarter. Notable transactions included Glencore's $49 billion 
acquisition of Xstrata; AIG's $6 billion follow
-
on equity offering; a $7.2 
billion investment
-
grade bond offering for Petrobras; and a $2.8 billion 
noninvestment
-
grade bond offering 
for United Rentals.
 
Advisory revenues of $313 million were down 23% versus the fourth quarter 
as market volumes remain subdued, particularly in the Americas.
 
Equity underwriting revenues were $172 million, a 9% decline from the 
fourth quarter, reflecting a
n industry
-
wide decline in IPO volume and an 
unfavorable shift in mix.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $366 million were up 27% versus 
last quarter with significantly higher bond issuance activity in both 
investment
-
grade and high
-
yield products. Thi
s strength was partially offset 
by a decline in syndicated loan revenues, which were negatively affected by 
lower levels of event financing.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues were $1.83 billion, an increase of 44% 
from last quarter. Results reflected conti
nued broad
-
based performance 
across geographies and products despite lower market
-
wide volumes. Client 
revenues remained resilient, demonstrated 
--
 
demonstrating ongoing 
realization of adjacencies across products and diversification of distribution 
across 
client segments.
 
Prime brokerage revenues were up on higher balances and a more favorable 
mix of activity. We continue to gain market share with notable 
outperformance in electronic and retail. Strong results also benefited from 
prudent risk management.
 
Fi
xed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues were $2.6 billion. 
Excluding the MBIA loss last quarter, revenues were more than double and 
were up 30% versus a year ago. Results this quarter reflected broad based 
strength and were also balanced acro
ss products and geographies. Stronger 
performance year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter underscores our 
continued emphasis on flow products, risk efficiency and increased velocity, 
with average balance sheets below 4Q '11 and 1Q '11 levels.
 
Each of our m
ajor product areas contributed meaningfully to results this 
quarter. Rates revenues increased, driven by higher client volumes 
benefiting from prior investments in our footprint.
 
FX results were up with lower balance sheet and continued to benefit from 
our
 
investment in technology. Credit revenues were up both quarter
-
over
-
quarter and year
-
over
-
year, reflecting improved credit markets and balance 
sheet efficiency. Commodities revenues rebounded from a slower fourth 
quarter as client activity, including stru
cture transactions, increased. 
Securitized products revenues were up sequentially but down versus a 
strong 1Q '11 comparison.
 
The other sales and trading line reflects negative revenues of $286 million 
versus positive $83 million last quarter.
 
Turning to V
AR, average total VAR declined from $123 million in the fourth 
quarter to $84 million this quarter using a 4
-
year data series. The decline 
reflects the full quarter impact of the MBIA settlement that occurred last 
December. Period
-
end VAR declined from $87
 
million at the end of the fourth 
quarter to $78 million at the end of the first quarter. Our average 
aggregated VAR by primary risk category for the quarter was $72 million 
versus $66 million in the fourth quarter.
 
Global Wealth Management revenues of $3.
4 billion were up 6% versus the 
prior quarter, driven by higher Asset Management fees and an increase in 
transaction
-
driven revenues. Specifically, Asset Management revenues were 
up 7% due to the benefit of higher equity market levels at the start of the 
q
uarter. GWM's Investment Banking
-
related fees increased 24% versus last 
quarter, primarily driven by fixed income new issuance.
 
Trading revenues were up 19% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting 
increased activity and markups in deferred compensation plans
. 
Commissions were roughly flat to last quarter. The other revenue line 
included lower gains on AFS sales versus the fourth quarter. Noninterest 
expenses were $3 billion, up 2% from last quarter. Compensation ratio was 
62% versus 64% last quarter. Non
-
comp
ensation expenses were $922 
million, flat to the fourth quarter. Migration costs were approximately $75 
million. As the integration is completed, we expect these expenses to taper 
off during the year.
 
Profit before tax was $387 million, while the PBT 
margin was 11%, up from 
7% last quarter. NCI for the quarter was $74 million, up from $16 million in 
the fourth quarter.
 
Total client assets increased to $1.7 trillion due to market appreciation and 
net asset inflows in the quarter. Global fee
-
based asset 
flows were $8.7 
billion. Fee
-
based assets under management grew to $531 billion at quarter 
end, up 8% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Global representatives at quarter end were 17,193. Bank deposits were $112 
billion at the end of the quarter with approximately $57 billio
n held in 
Morgan Stanley banks.
 
Asset Management revenues of $533 million were up from $424 million in 
the fourth quarter due primarily to markups in Merchant Banking and real 
estate funds and higher Asset Management fees. In Traditional Asset 
Management, 
revenues of $342 million were up 18% compared to the fourth 
quarter due to higher market levels.
 
In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $146 million were up 32% versus last 
quarter. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these 
revenu
es are passed to third
-
party investors in the non
-
controlling interest 
line.
 
In Merchant Banking, revenues of $45 million increased from $23 million in 
the fourth quarter, driven by higher markups on investments. Compensation 
expense was $218 million in th
e quarter, up from $183 million in the fourth 
quarter, reflecting higher revenue. Profit before tax was $128 million, up 
64% from last quarter. NCI was $65 million versus $44 million last quarter, 
reflecting markups and consolidated real estate funds.
 
Tota
l AUM increased to $304 billion due to higher market levels.
 
In conclusion, the global markets continue to be affected by ongoing macro 
uncertainties, but we remain focused on that which we can control. The 
strategic steps we've taken during the last 9 qua
rters are reflected in our 
results with broad strength across our businesses globally on an improved 
revenue mix, tight expense controls and a stronger foundation of capital and 
liquidity. Three observations. First, with respect to revenue, our results 
hig
hlight that the firm is far more balanced and diverse today than we have 
been in some time. In Institutional Securities, we drove revenue gains 
across our sales and trading franchise the Morgan Stanley way, based on 
insight, solutions and technology. Our I
nvestment Banking team continues 
to be engaged in leading significant transactions throughout the world. Our 
backlogs remain strong. We benefited this quarter from the absence of the 
legacy items we have addressed in the last 2 years.
 
In GWM, after extensi
ve investment and integration work, we are pleased 
with the platform the team has built. It enhances the FA and client 
experience, and increases efficiency opportunities by consolidating our 
business onto one platform. As evidenced by the consistency in re
venues, 
retail wealth management continues to support the stability of the firm's 
results. It is a more annuity
-
like, capital
-
light business that increases its 
contribution with ongoing growth in both our fee
-
based assets and our 
lending business.
 
Second, 
our approach to compensation and non
-
compensation expenses 
reflects our disciplined expense management. We continue to have success 
with our firm
-
wide cost
-
containment and reengineering efforts, and expect 
further benefits over the next 2 years.
 
Third, our
 
capital ratios remain industry
-
leading. We have a balanced and 
stable funding mix that will further improve as we exercise our MSSB call 
options, which will, in turn, add to our deposit base.
 
Our strategic priorities have also provided funding flexibility
. Specifically, as 
a result of a more liquid flow focused business, we did not refinance the 
majority of the $16 billion of debt that matured or was retired in the first 
quarter. Net debt outstanding declined $10 billion in the first quarter, 
continuing th
e trend we started last year. Meanwhile, our liquidity pool 
remained in line with 2011, with ending liquidity of $179 billion.
 
As I have noted previously, a key input to the sizing of the liquidity reserve 
is our upcoming maturities. The combined impact of
 
strong liquidity, the 
declining maturities going forward, put us in an even stronger position with 
respect to funding flexibility. Parent liquidity debt coverage is up significantly 
from 2 years ago, an indication of the strength of our balance sheet and 
our 
prudent liquidity risk management. We believe these steps put us in an even 
better position to serve our clients and our stakeholders. Thank you for 
listening, and James and I will now take your questions.

Crédit Suisse.
 
Howard Chen

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Regarding the meaningful improvement across the sales and trading 
franchises, I was just hoping you could share some thoughts
 
on how you 
separate what's market
-
related versus what's related to pay off from all the 
investments you've made over the past few years.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, I think we have to start with the investments that we've made over the 
last couple of years. What we 
saw this quarter was real strength across 
products and across geographies, and no one particular driver of results. 
Across the 5 businesses, all growing kind of within a narrow zone, rates, FX, 
corporate credit, commodities and investment grade securitizat
ion. And what 
we've been talking to you about over the last number of quarters, quite long 
number of quarters, is that we felt there was real upside as we moved back 
in the flow, an area where we've obviously been strong for many years but 
had underinveste
d for a period of time and our view was that we were 
punching below our weight and have the opportunity for market share 
upside, and invested in particular in rates and FX, and those were 2 of the 
important drivers. I think the other big driver here was we
 
talked internally 
about adjacencies when we talk about your equities business, the benefit of 
adjacencies, which, as we've talked about before, looks at working with 
clients across the platform. And that approach is very much reflected in the 
way we're ru
nning our Fixed Income business as well. It starts with the 
leadership team. It starts 
--
 
and then goes to our Senior Relationship 
Management program, our SRM program, and that's yet another investment. 
And then the third is really the technology investmen
ts that we've continued 
to make. That, in particular, is one I've highlighted over time and it's true 
again this quarter for our foreign exchange business benefiting from our 
electronic trading platform. So those all go to investments. I think the fact 
tha
t we started the quarter with a lower balance sheet and lower inventories 
really underscores that this is less about marks and more about flow and 
engagement with clients. And so I would say it helped that there was a 
--
 
have a constructive environment, no
 
question, but it goes to what we've 
been discussing with you repeatedly, quarter after quarter, the investments 
in the business and the focus.
 
James P. Gorman
 
I think also, Howard, the 
--
 
I would just take into account the leadership 
team, Colm Kelleher, 
who we put in that job a couple of years ago, and 
Kenny deRegt and Ted Pick in Fixed Income and Equities, respectively. This 
is now a very seasoned team working extremely well together across the 
firm. And I do believe the leadership makes a difference.
 
Ho
ward Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Great. And switching gears, Ruth, on the new held
-
for
-
investment 
disclosure, you had a near doubling of the HFI portfolio in the last quarter. 
Now is that a function of new clients or active refinancing? And 
as that 
portfolio grows, how do you think about the impact to your stress capital 
ratios, earnings volatility and hedging costs?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, that's really the driver of the move. We're clearly a mark
-
to
-
market 
shop as we always talk about, but we are 
a bank. The 15 floor just 
depository ballpark today and pro forma for the incremental MSSB deposits 
will be, ballpark, the 12th largest depository. And as we talked about last 
quarter under the CCAR scenarios, the impact of loans under HFI were less 
puniti
ve than fair value. And as we're looking to continue to build out our 
bank, consistent with other banks' practices and regulatory guidance, we've 
been focused on what's in the best interest of stakeholders. And our view 
was that if HFI is viewed as a 
--
 
or
 
results in being a more capital
-
efficient 
way to run the lending book, that's the appropriate way to migrate our 
lending book. And so what you've seen here is that movement to HFI this 
quarter, and you'll continue to see that.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse 
AG, Research Division
 
Okay. And then with respect to the Moody's review, could you just comment 
on what a downgrade means to you, and what you're all doing to prepare for 
and maybe prevent a potential downgrade?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. We've done a lot to narrow the impact of any potential ratings change 
and view that 
--
 
and our view is that the impact of potential outcomes are 
manageable. Obviously, ratings reviews started a few years ago, first with 
S&P and then with Fitch and no
w with Moody's, and so we have had time to 
prepare. And so trying to get some perspective on how we look at it or how 
we think about the impact, structure derivatives is obviously the most 
affected by ratings change, but it's also an area of focus for regu
latory 
reform. And as we've reduced the scope of our structured derivatives 
business, that's very consistent with our change in business mix toward cash 
and flow products. And that's been kind of an over time, and I just comment 
on with respect to what we'
re doing broadly in Fixed Income. But what that 
means is at this point, only 8% of our ISDA contracts have triggers within 
the Moody's potential range, which helps reduce the size, kind of step 1. The 
other key point is that a large amount can be centrally
 
cleared, and we were 
early and aggressive to move to central clearing and become client
-
central 
clearing broker. Two of the largest fixed income asset managers were also 
easy 
--
 
early in moving to clearing, and we won mandates to become their 
clearing bro
kers. And the trend towards clearing is clearly ratings 

then beyond that, we have a higher graded derivatives entity, and we've 
slowly been moving derivatives into our bank. So tha
t kind of sizes and 
brings down the scope within, and hopefully, underscores the couple of work 
streams, which underscore why I started by saying we think the potential 
outcomes are manageable. The other point, I think, is really key is that none 
of our fu
nding has ratings triggers. So that side of it is very easy to address 
as well. I think across the platform, we've done a lot to narrow the potential 
impact.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Great, very helpful, Ruth. Maybe just a quick fo
llow
-
up on the ongoing 
business. At a percent of figure you noted, is that just number of ISDA 
contracts or is that 
--
 
what does that mean as a percentage of maybe 
revenues or earnings contribution today?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, that is 8% of ISDA contracts, and t
hat's why I kind of started there and 
then went down to what are the various incremental steps that we've taken. 
I think the other thing I would point you to is that we're still A
-
rated by S&P 
and Fitch, and a lot of clients are doing their own credit asse
ssments, so 
hard to gauge how that translates into any other impact on the business.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
I wanted to see if we 
-
-
 
if I could just follow up on what you're talking about 
just now with respect to the Moody's. I know that, that moving contracts 
into better
-
rated entities was pretty far down your list of actions that you've 
taken. But I'm just interested in the idea of 

other entity that you might have developed, and sort of how sizable you 
think that could be in terms of helping you mitigate the impacts.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, with the respect to the bank broadly, our strategy or objective is to 
b
uild a robust national bank that's consistent with our Wealth Management 
business and building a balanced portfolio of assets in the bank, 
systematically. And I've talked at length, I think, on 2 different topics that 
are relevant to that. One is building 
our lending business of institutional and 
retail, and two is moving derivatives into the bank. And when we've talked 
about the lending business in particular, on the retail side, I've talked about 
this being a flow systematic steady build, building out the
 
suite of products 
that we're offering to our retail clients, taking our time to build that out so 
that we've got the right credit and quality control over the build. That's one 
key portion of the asset side. And the other is, we have talked about before, 
slowly, systematically working to move derivatives into the bank. We started 
with FX and rates will follow. And our view is the result of both of those 
steps will be a balanced asset portfolio against $60 billion of deposits, with 
another $60 billion of de
posits to come as we buy in the remaining Morgan 
Stanley Smith Barney stakes over time. And our view is and have been that 
we have a higher rated derivatives entity to the extent it's needed and have 
stayed on this course of a longer
-
term approach to movin
g more derivatives 
into the bank.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
And the bank deposit build on the retail side is directly related to the 
percentage ownership of the joint ventures, isn't that right?
 
Ruth Porat
 
As we exercise variou
s tranches of the remaining buy
-
in for MSSB, we 
--
 
with that comes the pro rata portion of deposits, correct.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Got it. I was hoping that maybe you could talk about the restatement of 
your capital alloca
tions on Page 5 of your supplement. That's always an 
incredibly helpful disclosure, by the way, as I think we've discussed before, 
but you did restate it. And I'm not sure I completely understand what the 
footnote is telling us.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So there 
--
 
I th
ink one of the key things 
--
 
I'm not quite sure what you're 
referring to, but one of the things as we've allocated here on capital back to 
MSSB, the reason we increased the allocation to MSSB was consistent with 
guidance that came out during the CCAR proce
ss, which is that associated 
with NCI under Basel I, one now needs to allocate capital for that NCI. We 
have been doing that under Basel III and we talked about it last quarter that 
we had moved from parent capital into MSSB, the NCI portion of capital.
 
Gu
y Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Okay, that helps. And then just on the Institutional side on the restated 
basis that you now showed us. I noticed that the capital allocation fell by 
almost $2 billion in the quarter. Is that related to 
the reduction in VAR and 
the reduction in the legacy MBIA position? Or is it something else?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I'm not sure. Why don't you follow up with IR on that one?
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.
 
Michael Carrier
 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
First on the Wealth Management business. So you had the improvement in 
the margin this quarter. Given the integration costs, I just want to make 
sure, is it that simple, meaning as the $75 million or so of integration
 
expense comes out, we should see that 11%? I think if I just do the math, it 
will move up to maybe 13%, 13.5%. And then just in the near term, given 
that we've had the market tailwind, you gave some stats in the past in terms 
of how sensitive that busines
s is to an improvement there and then as well 
as rates. Any difference there? Because it feels like we're getting the 
market, at least for the time being, but just any changes in those 
sensitivities?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The focus on margin is still on mid
-
teens margin by mid next year. And 
although we're getting the benefit of reduced integration expense, as you 
pointed out, we're also having some of that offset by increased software 
capitalization expense as we've talked
 
about on prior calls. So the way we're 
driving to the mid
-
teens margin in part comes from integration expense, 
although it's not quite as big as that full 75, given software cap. It's also 
additional cost discipline focus and expense discipline focus, is 
the continued 
build out of our lending platform that I just mentioned. And it's also the 
ongoing growth in managed money. Those are really the key drivers of 
margin expansion. And that's going to continue as we go through next year. 
We do get a bit of a be
nefit, in particular, next year when we're all operating 
on one platform. It makes some of that second category, the expense 
discipline cost saving programs easier to implement, but it's really the 
combination of the same items that we've been discussing o
ver time. And 
then as it relates to the market benefit, we did get a bit of a lift here, given 
the S&P started the first quarter higher than it was at the beginning of the 
fourth quarter, and going into the second quarter, we similarly have a bit of 
a bene
fit from that. But the mid
-
teens guidance was 
--
 
mid
-
teen PBT margin 
guidance assumed no market benefit. And if we continue to have market 
benefit, that helps. Similarly, if Fed funds rise, that helps.

Okay. And then just on the buy
-
in, so we don't have all the details, but when 
you think about 
--
 
obviously, the valuation will play a part, your other 
options will play a part. And then just how 
--
 
what flexibility you have with 
the Fed, but when we start 
thinking about timing of that and in other 
opportunities, what 
--
 
is the likelihood you 
--
 
still that occurring during the 
near term?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Well, Michael, it's James. Let me address that. We're 
--
 
we've said for a long 
time that we like this busi
ness, it's strategically important to us. And while 
it's been difficult market conditions for a couple of years, we do think we 
know how to manage it well and we're in the last 10 weeks of a pretty 
massive, in fact, historically largest integration. So we'
re on track and the 
first call option is available, I believe, at the end of May or the 1st of June. 
And obviously, at that time or some time before that, we'd have a discussion 
with 

 
with our friends at Citigroup on the first call option. We have a prett
y 
clear path over what is now only 2 years to buy the remaining pieces. We 
feel no particular compulsion or anxiety to accelerate that. We have great 
clarity around what we're trying to do with the business. Obviously, we're 
always prepared to listen, but 
we're in a position where we have a clear 
path, we have a clear plan. We've had this plan now for over 3 years and 
we're frankly, rapidly moving to the end of it. So that's where we are right 
now.
 
Michael Carrier

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Okay.
 
And last one, just on the ROE for the overall business. Obviously, 
you've seen a pretty good improvement versus the last, call it, 2 years, but 

the legacy assets and the things tha
t you've been doing, even on the trading 
side, like how far along are you in that process? Because clearly, a better 
macro environment can still get that up, but you also had the seasonality 
against you. But just wondering how much of getting rid of some o
f the 
legacy issues or transitioning under the new regulatory environment is done 
versus the rest, more of a macro environment improvement will drive 
stronger revenues?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We'll be the first to agree that ROE, we're still on a path of improving ove
r 
time and it is benefiting from systematic execution in the businesses, but we 
are in a path. If you just kind of go through the 3 big buckets of categories 
that should continue to drive ROE, on the Institutional Securities side we felt 
really good exitin
g 2011, having addressed the legacy issues that we have 
been speaking with you about for so long. And exiting those, having those 
drags gone is helpful. We have been reducing our presence in businesses 
which, under Basel III are more capital
-
consuming and 
moving to a more 
--
 
well, model which is more capital efficient, so you get some lift just from the 
mix of the business and that's continuing. On the GWM side, moving in the 
direction of the mid
-
teens PBT margin, after 3
-
plus years, as James said, will 
hel
p as we benefit from integration and a higher PBT margin on that 
business. And then we're continuing our disciplined approach on comp and 
non
-
compensation. So those are just 
--
 
those are 3 of the bigger levers that 
will help continue to drive ROE. We're do
ing a lot more, but we're 
comfortable on this path.
 
James P. Gorman
 
And I would just add, Michael, I think that there were areas of our business 
that clearly benefited from a, I would call it, a reasonable market 
environment, not exactly a bullish market e
nvironment. But there were 
areas that did not. I mean, in the first quarter of the new issued calendar in 
equities, it was not exactly robust. M&A and advisory work, frankly, was 
very low across the industry. Our Wealth Management business, as Ruth 
said, w
ith rates that are basically 0 interest rates and no equity calendar, 
clearly, that business wasn't exactly operating at a seasonal or market high. 
So there were pluses and minuses as you put it all together with the cost 
backdrop that we're working on wit
h the integration stuff we've talked 
about, the continued retooling we've been doing in securities businesses. 
We're quite comfortable with the path we're on.

So look, the 
--
 
I give you credit where credit is due. The trading results were 
awesome and awesome on a relative basis as well. And everything that you 
said about the investments made it all make sense. I guess my question 
is, 
what's different about this first quarter that produced such a payoff? In 
other words, if you look at it relative to, say, the last 8, 10 quarters' 
average, your increase is literally 50% more than everybody else in both 
equities and FICC. So I don't w
ant to complain, it's great numbers. I'm just 
curious on what you think that made this first quarter to pay off.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Well, I think, Glenn, firstly, quarters, as I've said often, come around with 
remarkable frequency, every 13 weeks. We're alrea
dy 3 or 4 weeks into the 
end of the next month, so we're talking about ancient history here. But I 
think it's if you look at equities in the last couple of years, this is not a flash 
in the pan. This has been a pretty considered and deliberate progress wit
h 
our franchise, I think, had gained market share of over 350 basis points last 
year and continued to be strong this quarter. Fixed Income, obviously, there 
was better balance in the business. A lot of the pieces came together nicely 
across rates, foreign 
exchange. Our credit rebounded. A little bit of it was 
environmental as we said, and a little bit of it was the leadership and a little 
bit of it was the investments we've made in the platform. So I don't regard it 
as kind of a bolt of lightning out of the
 
sky here. I think it's the aggregation 
of a series of things that have been steady investments. Every quarter won't 
look exactly the same, that's for sure. I'm sure we'll see some ups and some 
downs over the next several quarters, but it shows evidence th
at the 
investments we made are in the right direction.

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Okay. A question, Ruth, I heard all your comments regarding funding cost 
and debt issuance or debt decreasing in the quarter. I actually hav
e the 
opposite question on debt issuance plans going forward. And I think your 
average maturities in that 5
-
year range has come down over time where, 
my intuition would tell me that you'd want to be extending duration 
especially 
--
 
some of the things that 
Moody's points out on the business 
needing to stand on its own 2 feet. Can we 
--
 
can you help us think through 
what your debt issuance pay, and so on how you think about today's funding 
cost, where they should be over time?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. The way 
--
 
I thi
nk it's a great question, and the way I start on that is 
really looking at funding requirements as a function of our business mix and 
our balance sheet. And as I spoke about on the last quarter's call, there are 
really 3 strategic priorities that frame the
 
way I think about funding. First, 
our strategy for business mix has moved towards flow from structured, and 
we can fund that efficiently through the secured channel and we are. 
Second, exiting legacy positions has really decreased the need for unsecured 
f
unding. A lot of these positions were less liquid and they were cash
-
funded, 
and by exiting them, not only do we 
--
 
we free up some of the requirements 
there. And that was a part of the story this quarter and frankly, over the last 
couple of quarters. And 
then the growth of our deposit base, consistent with 
what we're doing in MSSB, is funding both our corporate and our retail loan 
book, and enabling us to fund more with the deposit base, it reduces our 
reliance on unsecured funding. So overall, the strateg
ic moves towards a 
leaner, more velocity
-
focused balance sheet have allowed us to extract 
funding from the balance sheet, which means we're not and we haven't 
refinanced all the maturities. So specifically, and I made this point, in the 
first quarter, we p
aid down $16 billion in debt. We issued $5 billion. In other 
words, net debt down $10 billion in the first quarter alone. And we've 
reduced net debt by $16 billion over the past couple of quarters, and we did 
this while improving revenue strength and captu
ring market share and 
maintaining high liquidity. So this is where we really want to be, which is 
delivering for clients and enhancing our funding. And as I talked about a lot 
on the last quarter, I felt like I was the beneficiary when I'm thinking about 
f
unding of all of the strategic things that have been done. And so very much 
to your point, our maturities, our rolling 12
-
month maturities, peaked in 
September of last year and they've been on a downward trajectory, and that 
gives us some funding flexibili
ty. And as we think about how to benefit from 
that funding flexibility, we're looking, as we have consistently over the last 
several years, at optimizing our unsecured issuance across channels, vanilla 
debt, structured notes and ongoing work with our partn
er, MUFG, in the 
Japanese market with the Uridashi issuance. We're looking across currency 
and we're being mindful of what's the wham of the overall book. But the way 
we think about it is, given high liquidity and declining maturities, I 
mentioned this, li
quidity maturity statistic, what's notable is we're now at 38 
months coverage. In other words, parent liquidity covers the next 38 months 
of maturities which is up from 23 months, 2 years ago. And it just goes to 
the prudent way we're running the balance s
heet and the high degree of 
flexibility we have as a result of it.

Glenn Schorr

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
On that note, with it, again, price aside, I think there's something in it for 
both sides to do more of MSSB sooner. So price aside, it's highly likely not a 
big capital call. 
Is there a thought to just issue a bunch of debt as spreads 
come in and take the whole thing in?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Listen. Obviously, we're not going to talk about a particular transaction. As 
we've said, our focus is on, number one, getting the 
integration done. We're 
11 weeks away from that. Number two, we will proceed with the first call 
option, and that's 5 weeks away or something like that. And number three, 
eventually owning 100% of this business, which we can do on a very clear 
program over
 
the next 24 months. So I'm in the camp of we like certainty. 
We have what we think is a well
-
structured deal that was laid out 3 years 
ago. We're right at approaching crunch time, which is pretty exciting. But we

it'd take a lot to encourage us to get

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
Just a couple of things. On the compensation ratio in the Institutional 
Securities group, could you talk about whether that is a level that could hold 
for the year? And then secondly, just 
to double check my understanding of 
the 8% to 9%, sorry, on Basel III, look through ratio in Q1, is all of that 100 
basis points difference the potential impact of the NPR on Basel 2.5?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Certainly. So starting with the compensation ratio, we're a
ccruing what we 
think is reasonable looking at those absolute dollars and ratios. It's obviously 
early in the year and the same thing we talked about on prior calls remains, 
which is we're very focused on balancing, driving ROE on the one hand and 
compensa
ting and retaining talent that's driving that ROE. And this is 
obviously an industry
-
wide balance, but we've got a team refocused on it. 
And within Institutional Securities, the compensation ratio reflects the 
severance that I commented on. I think it was 
just over $100 million, $107 
million in ISG alone. So that's part of the overall number, but we're still 
maintaining that very much that lends, which is we've got to get the balance 
right to drive ROE while paying the talent that's driving that ROE, and it
 
is 
early in the year. On the Basel III question, you're absolutely correct that 
the range really reflects the ongoing uncertainty regarding Basel 2.5 NPR. 
And until there is greater certainty, we think it's most prudent just to give 
you a range, and we're
 
within that range. We'll tighten up as we also 
become more clear.

Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
I just want to follow up on a couple other questions that 
have been asked. I 
guess just on the 
--
 
in the sort of the strength of the first quarter, it feels 
like your strength, your revenue generation actually builds over the course 
of the quarter with March being stronger, whereas I think others have saw 
the opp
osite, January being stronger. I mean was there something that 
--
 
were one of these areas particularly strong in March? And then obviously, it's 
only a couple of weeks into April, but has that momentum carried on?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, actually, I think we star
ted January coming into the year, I think, with 
the benefits of LTRO kind of as the tailwind. We started January and things 
were pretty attractive. I think we were mindful of the fact that we entered 
the quarter with low balance sheet, and therefore, weren
't benefiting from 
much of a big inventory that would be written up, but sub, a pretty good 
activity on the sales and trading side in January. I think it got a little muted 
in the middle of the quarter, and then did end the quarter, to your point, 
stronger
. And I think it's too early to call 3 weeks, 2 weeks into the second 
quarter. I'd be remiss to try and extrapolate from where we are here, and so 
much of it continues to be what's going on in the macro environment. You 
tell me that, and I'll give you a bi
t of a cleaner forecast for the second 
quarter. So too early at this point.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
I can't figure that out either. So just 
--
 
it reminds me another point I want to 
ask on the balance sheet. So these, to the a
verage balance sheet, your 
inventory levels were down. Can you characterize how the ending balance 
sheet may have looked versus the average or versus end of 4Q?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The average and ending for the first quarter were pretty consistent. It's in 
the sup
plement. They were within 
--
 
they were close and they've kind of 
stayed at those levels. We're continuing to run a sub
-
$800 billion balance 
sheet.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
I mean, I'm referring more just to your risk capital w
ithin the trading 
business. I think that's what you're referring to.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, so that, similarly, really has not changed much, 
continuing to run at the same kind of more modest levels. And I think when 
we look at the Fixed Income resu
lts, we 
--
 
it is a story about breadth across 
a number of product areas. But in particular, when you look at the fact that 
we ran at low VAR and the balance sheet, where it was, ROA was up nicely, 
VAR efficiency was up as well. It's continued to run at tho
se kinds of levels, 
and no change really there.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay. And then just back on the credit rating discussion. So your comments 
around using the higher rate of bank entity, is 
--
 
can you 
--
 
do you have 
sufficient capacity, given the size of the bank deposit base that are today to 
accommodate any existing business that may have technical requirements 
under 

 
if the rating were to be downgraded to move [indiscernible]. If you 

terday, saying they will have to move some 
business away. I mean, can we make sure that Morgan Stanley is not on the 
ones on the list?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, that's why I went through the various steps and execution paths. We 
got multiple execution paths, and th
at's what gives us the comfort to say 
that outcomes are manageable. So apart from that, which essentially 

indicated, we have a higher rated derivatives entity, and that's a valuable
 
next part of the execution path, longer
-
term. It goes to the bank, but we've 
got a number of different execution paths, which is why there are solutions 
here that make it very manageable.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
So no one wo
uld actually have to leave, right? You can accommodate any 
requirements?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Look, I think I would point to one other thing, which I commented on, which 
is, first and foremost, I don't want to prejudge the Moody's outcome, but a 
lot of clients are f
ocused on what are the other ratings that we have for the 
firm. We're still A
-
rated by S&P and Fitch, and a lot of clients are doing their 
own credit assessment. Some of the questions that are coming up are more 
structure
-
related than anything else. And fo
r that, we've focused in, I kind of 
gone through what are the execution options available.
 
James P. Gorman
 
And I think, Roger, just on ratings, it's important to note that when Moody's 
first came out to render their opinion on all of the banks around the w
orld, it 
was before the stress test was 
--
 
the results of that were published, which is 
obviously important information. And it was before the first quarter results 
of the large institutions, certainly, in the U.S. So they now have the benefit 
of 2 concret
e pieces of information that they didn't have. And I think it's 
important and constructive that they're delaying their readout on this until 
early June as they try to assimilate all of that positive feedback they've had 
from the industries.

What are the investment banking backlogs? And how do they compare to a 
quarter ago?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The equity backlog remains strong and continues to b
uild. And I feel like I've 
been saying that quarter after quarter and the appropriate question is, and 
what takes it to move out of backlog and into execution. We did see a bit 
more of that in March. There was some kind of a bit of a pickup in equity 
new i
ssue product, and that gives us, I guess I would say guarded optimism 
that we'll see more of it here in the second quarter. Of course, the market 
backdrop always being one of the key determinants, but that remains an 
attractive pipeline. M&A is similarly a
 
healthy backlog and we're having a lot 
of conversations with clients. I think the view continues to be that there is 
still CEO concern about the durability of the recovery, not just in the U.S., 
but around the globe. And therefore, we would be more guarde
d on the 
speed of movement of M&A deals out of the pipeline. We'd love to see that 
accelerate, clearly, but I think the view of our team has been for quite some 
time, if you look at historical patterns, it's more likely that it is a back half of 
the year r
ather than a front half, including second quarter movement out of 
the pipeline and onto announced transactions.

On the brokerage business, I'm glad you asked that because we have 
included in here fee

kind of consistent with the trend we saw last year. We have shifted the 
d
isclosure, as we talked about previously, to fee

reason for that is that's really strategically where we've been focused, and 
that is the stronger relationship between funds movement and our P&L is on

forward, given that's the way the senior

4/21/15,Morgan Stanley,"Sure. We were pleased to see continued retail investor engagement in the 
fourth quarter, and that is reflected in higher transactional revenues. The 
integration process is moving very much on track. As you look at what does 
that mean and how do we 
look at the overall PBT targets, we're still very 
much focused on PBT of 20%. That's market dependent. And so, just a 
couple of pieces as you look through 2011 and beyond. First of all, retail 
activity was important. It helped drive the transaction revenue
s. I would 
caution you, there are fewer trading days in the first quarter of '11, that's 
relevant. But as we look forward, the market remains constructive, the 
building blocks to get to that 20% PBT margin are, to your point, completion 
of the integration 
and the drag that comes from the spend. But it's also a 
function of building up our Lending business, as we talked about before. 
Because with the Lending business, we have the benefit of driving a non
-
compensable revenue, which are an important part to red
ucing our overall 
compensation ratio in the business. The third element, the PBT margin 
expansion, is market dependent. We've said that. But just to give you a 
couple of data points that might be helpful. Every 100
-
point change in the 
S&P, we estimate impa
cts margin around 1%, all else being equal. And 
that's not looking at kind of investor psyche and reaction, but it's really more 
on the Asset Management fee side. Similarly, every 50 basis
-
point change in 
fed funds can impact margin around 1% as well. So i
t's really those 
elements completing the integration, building up the Lending business and 
market dependent that drives us to the 20% margin over time.

I guess maybe asked another way. I don't know if you look at it this 
way. 
But if there's no change in revenues from, let's say, where we are to end the 
year in the fourth quarter, what would you anticipate your margins to be as 
we exit 2011?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We're not going to do a forecastable forum. We're hoping to give you the
 
pieces so that you can model with that yourself.
 
James Gorman
 
I just say this, Howard, we're not passive in managing the business.

And then, finally for me, Ruth, you spoke about the impact on the monoline 
exposure on fixed 
income results. Could you just give it a little more detail 
on what exactly is driving that? Is that the health of the wraps or you're 
hedging against that, or the counterparty exposure? And what should we be 
watching, going forward, to just continue to se
e that and how it impacts 
thick?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So this is a legacy exposure. It's going to take time to work out. The main 
point that we talked about repeatedly is we're not taking on new outside 
risks. We were a counter party in the trade, and we hedged our 
exposure 
with detail in the Q and of course the updated data in the K. But this 
quarter, the hedges went the other way on tightening monoline credit 
exposures, which is what resulted in the losses. So it was costly to hedge 
this quarter. You may continue t
o see a drag depending on market direction. 
The loss this quarter was $263 million, pretty much in line with last quarter.

The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.

UBS
 
So equity was up in the quarter, assets came d
own a little bit on the balance 
sheet, but the Tier 1 common ratio was down a little bit. I'm just curious if 
something changed on the risk weightings or how that works? I know it's 
small but just interesting directionally.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. First, at this 
point, our risk
-
weighted asset number is just an estimate. 
The final numbers will be in the K. But risk
-
weighted assets increased from 
$325 billion at the end of the third quarter to we estimate $328 billion at 
December 31. So to your point, it was a small
 
move. It was really much 
more of a mix change that resulted in a modest change. And the Tier 1 
common was a bit lower due to a higher DT8 [ph] (31:19) deduction.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
UBS
 
And then just curious on the 4% reduction in assets, where are you seeing 
the opportunities to reduce balance sheet?
 
Ruth Porat
 
You're asking about overall balance sheet size coming down?
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
UBS
 
Yes, and I'll tell you why I'm asking. If you look at the 17
-
or
-
so times 
common leverage or assets, the buyback common equi
ty, that's about in the 
range where I think you can rest over time. I'm just curious how you think 
about the improving ROA and what's left on that balance sheet that's 
dragging that ROA down? I mean, it's a little different question than thick 
improving.
 
R
uth Porat
 
So balance sheet was down this quarter. That was really much more about 
client activity than anything. And we still remain comfortable kind of in that 
$800 billion to $850 billion range that we're talking about. But the point 
about ROA is very im
portant, and we are very focused on it. And to your 
point, it is about ensuring that we are redeploying capital out kind of the 
capital
-
heavier areas and putting them behind our core institutional money 
management business and sales and trading business. A
nd in particular, on 
the sales and trading side, our view is as we continue to build out our 
footprint and our flow business, we're going to be able to drive a more 
efficient utilization of the balance sheet and we are very focused on ROA.

And so, I guess it takes time? In other words, I think a simple question is 
where's the leverage being used, like it takes time to wean yourself off of 
that? Is that what I'm hearing?
 
Ruth Porat
 
There are two elements very important, as we said. In 
Fixed Income, we're 
in the first of a two
-
year steady build, and it is about delivering consistency 
and dependability to clients which will increase our flow business and 
efficient utilization of the balance sheet. So that's one element of it. The 
other is
 
we are systematically reducing the drag from legacy positions. 

redeploy capital behind our core Sales and Trading business in the most 
efficient areas.

A simple
 
last one on balance sheet is the 10.5% Tier 1 common? I'm just 
curious if you had any updated thoughts on Basel III compliance today and 
how that plays out?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, as we said before, we remain very comfortable with respect to Basel, 
both capital
 
and liquidity, and have capacity to absorb the new rules with 
parent capital, which is about $20 billion. Just to give you a bit of an update 
on Basel III, our RWA guidance is virtually unchanged, essentially 
unchanged, same zip code from the commentary a
fter the third quarter. So 
if you take our RWAs at 12/31, take our balance sheet under Basel III, 
RWAs would be at $240 billion and then through passive mitigation, kind of 
through the end of 2012, it would be down about $100 billion. And I guess 
the other
 
factors to layer in to how we think about Tier 1 common under 
Basel III, couple items affecting capital. First, we have as you know $7.8 
billion of MUFG convertible to common, which is meaningful. We have the 
14% Smith Barney buy
-
in in 2012 and the NCI as
sociated with Morgan 
Stanley Smith Barney. So if we take our consensus earnings, those factors, 
our 12/31 balance sheet under Basel III, and the ratio at the end of 2012 
would be between 8% and 10%, which is why we say we're very 
comfortable with respect t
o Basel III.

Do you have any more specific financial targets? That was helpful, your 
com
mentary for the year ahead. I was wondering if we could get a little 
more meat on the bones. A lot of your peers have more specific financial 
targets. And if you don't have a specific financial target, are you looking 
more at revenues or earnings or ROE, o
r which metrics?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we, across the businesses, I think we've 
--
 
we gave you some more 
specifics on GWM. What we're looking for longer term is this PBT margin of 
20%. Again, I'll give you the caveat, market dependent. But we're 
continuing to exec
ute on that plan as I went through. On the Investment 
Management side, you saw the improvements in particular this quarter. And 
again, it's about building the core institutional, Money Management business 
and being 
--
 
efficiently redeploying capital out of
 
Merchant Banking hedge 
funds, seed investments to support that core institutional business. And 
within our Institutional Securities business, we have real strength in 
Investment Banking and equities, where on our steady build within fixed 
income, it is ab
out driving ROA. And I think in the aggregate, what we are 
looking at is, overall, we're very focused on what is ROE and delivering 
attractive returns for shareholders. So that's what we're driving. As James 
said, we're outstanding still on any of these bu
sinesses, driving execution 
across them.
 
James Gorman
 
The only thing I'd add is that last year, we hired a lot of the people, we hired 
a lot of very senior people. Actually, the weighted number of folks that we 
bought in, a lot of MDs and these folks are g
etting traction. We're not 
aggressively hiring right now. Obviously, if a specific opportunity comes up, 
we fill it. But we want to see some of the progress from those hires. And the 
improved client penetration we're getting particularly into some of our f
ixed
-
income products. So this is a year where we are now digesting the expenses 
and if things go as we planned them to go, we'll see good returns come off 
those.

Credit Agricole Securities (

And I know you said the first of a two
-
year of a build in the trading areas 
and you hired a lot of traders. Do you think it's working? What sort of 
conviction do you have about this hire for growth strategy within trading? Do 
you feel better or 
worse about it?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We remain very confident and comfortable with the strategy. If we look at 
third
-
party data, it would suggest that we are gaining market share in a 
number of the businesses. Now the key is seeing that third
-
party data 
translate in
to greater results. And so, when we look at kind of the drivers of 
the business, in particular this quarter, we think that we're seeing signs of 
progress. We're pleased with the steps we're taking, continuing to execute 
against plan. But it was challenging
 
being in a risk on, risk off market. And 
so, we had client activity but trading facilitation, market making was limited. 
And it is about both building up what we're doing, and we do remain very 
much on track, on point in that regard and having a bit of a 
more 
constructive market.

The next question will come from Jeff Harte from Sandler O'Neill.
 
Jeffrey Harte

Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.
 
Can you talk a little bit about the Investment Banking outlook? And I guess 
I'm thinking we see a lot of eq
uity deals getting done. But coming off of a 
record revenue quarter, are you seeing enough potential activities filling the 
pipeline for strength to continue?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So overall, our investment pipelines do remain healthy across products and 
regions. It
 
was a bit frustrating throughout the year to keep saying our 
pipeline is building, and it was just a question of time seeing the 
transactions moving through the pipeline, and I think you saw that in the 
fourth quarter. But the pipelines do remain healthy 
across products and 
globally. So on the M&A front, the pipeline's strong. We do expect a positive 
momentum that we experienced in 2010 to continue into 2011. We're seeing 
increased private equity activity and cross
-
border activity and emerging 
markets M&A.
 
And it is very much about a lot of the factors we spoke about 
during the year, with high corporate cash balances and now, you know, with 
increasingly improved corporate confidence. And on the equity side, the 
backlog does remain strong. And again, it's ar
ound the globe. Asia remains 
strong, as does Europe and Latin America. We expect also to see more of 
the sponsor
-
led financing coming through the pipeline.
 
Jeffrey Harte 
-
 
Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.
 
And how about on the Fixed Income Trading side of th
e business? I mean, 
you built up the business. What kind of market environment or assumptions 
are you making for how big this business should be?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think that we're looking for more of a 
--
 
we're not looking for a heroic 
move in the fixed
-
income
 
market. We're looking for a more muted or a more 
predictable environment. So in contrast to what was a pretty stark risk on, 
risk off market this past quarter, the absence of that kind of whip saw is 
what we need. We have two things, really, the backdrop 
of the environment. 
And it is not as though we are looking for another 2009
-
type environment. 
What we are looking for is again this absence of the risk on, risk off that 
had, at its core, a lot of policy
-
related events that drove activity. And so, 
kind of 
a more benign environment, and that enables us to really close the 
gap we have within fixed income. So if you look across our Institutional 
Securities business, we have a top
-
tier Investment Banking franchise, a very 
strong institutional equities business.
 
And what we're really just looking to 
do is close the gap within certain areas, not even across the board. Within 
certain areas of fixed income capitalizing on strengths we already have 
within fixed income.
 
James Gorman
 
I'd just add also, we have an 
important Commodities business the last 
couple of years. Metals and agriculture have been major drivers of revenue 
for the industry. Our historic strengths have been in gas and oil. And I think 
as those markets are now starting to move, that business becom
es more 
important to us.
 
Jeffrey Harte 
-
 
Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.
 
As I look at the Wealth Management business, one of the things that kind of 
jumps out at me is net interest income doubling plus year
-
over
-
year. But 
then, I look at the deposit balanc
e, and it's essentially flat on a year
-
over
-
year basis. That implies net interest margin expansion that we're not really 
seeing from other players. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that 
net interest income increase?
 
James Gorman
 
My guess is t
here are two drivers behind that. One is the business wasn't 
owned for 12 months, in was owned for 7 months. So you get the impact of 
the $50
-
plus billion of deposits that sat on the Citi side, in addition to the 
$50 billion that sat on the Morgan Stanley 
side. So you get $100 billion per 
year. And the other is the growth in the lending businesses. You look at the 
margin book and I saw some of the online players reported their margin 
balances. They've grown pretty dramatically. We don't have as volatile a 
m
argin book as that. But clearly with the rising equity markets, our margin 
business has grown, and some of the leading and the spreads you get on the 
lending product that we've been building up.
 
Jeffrey Harte 
-
 
Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.
 
Is the margin
 
book the bulk of the lending within GWM still? And I guess, as 
you look forward, is non
-
margin
-
related lending something you try to grow?
 
James Gorman
 
Sure. The margin book is significant. But we've also 
--
 
we originate prime 
mortgages and small business 
loans and other things.
 
Jeffrey Harte 
-
 
Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.
 
And, finally, just kind of trying to reconcile some of the items in the quarter. 
It looks as though ex DVA, you accrued compensation expense against some 
of the other gains. Am I think
ing of that correctly?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, you are. Items like CICC are included as part of our revenue and we 
accrue comp against it.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
I just 
wanted to go back to the DVA. It's so sizable. I was just hoping that 
maybe you could give us some metrics that can help us get some analytical 
clarity around the number? I mean, we've all been kind of conditioned to 
look through, and even so, when it's si
zable you just want to really feel like 
you understand it. And given what we know happened to your cash bond 
spread, and even though you've issued a lot of structured product, it just 
seems like it was a very outsized move. Could you give us some of the 
un
derlying metrics to help us understand it?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Absolutely, good question. There are a couple of things I mentioned briefly. 
So to expand upon them, first, the average outstanding balance was up 
almost about 10% from the third quarter. There was a lo
t of interest in this 
product, so up almost about 10%. Second, the weighted
-
average maturity of 
the portfolio extended. And so, the change in the 10
-
year spreads played a 
bigger role. And then about 20% of the overall DVA was due to the option of 
extending
 
maturity that's embedded in certain of the notes. So on the 
metrics, if you go to WAM, that moved nearly five years in the fourth 
quarter. It was three
-
and
-
a
-
half years when we last disclosed it in 2009. And 
so, again, focusing on the 10
-
year cash bond sp
reads this quarter, they 
tightened 56 basis points versus 27 in the third quarter. I'm glad you 
pointed out, it is cash bond spreads. Because the 10
-
year CDF was in only 
seven basis points. But that was a pretty meaningful narrowing. And to your 
point, wit
h the WAM ex [ph] (0:45:43) moving out, it became more relevant 
to look at the 10
-
year.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
And has the WAM moved out partly because of the nature of what you 
issued and also partly because there is essentially some negative
 
curvexity 
[ph] (0:45:58) built into this?
 
Ruth Porat
 
It's really by virtue of what we were issuing.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Just to tie it together, you were talking before about some of the monoline 
credit spread impact. Is that related to th
is as well? Is that part of the 900
-
and
-
some
-
odd million or is that separate?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Completely separate.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
To the point that was brought up a minute ago on the compensation effect 
on the CICC, do you believe that 
comp really would have been lower if you 
hadn't had the gain? The reason I ask is that, again, as we think about 
modeling out future earnings power, we need to really understand what your 
comp dollar needs are. And based on what we heard in the press, and 
obviously a lot of that stuff can be wrong, it seems like the firm needed 
every dollar of comp that it had available to it. And so I wondered if your 
comp dollars actually would have been less even if you hadn't had the gain?
 
James Gorman
 
Guy, we are focus
ed on balancing what we think is right for our shareholders 
and ensuring that we pay the right people the way we've got to pay them. 
The fact of the matter is, if we didn't have the revenues and we didn't have 
the earnings, we would have adjusted it throug
h our compensation. We've 
been very deliberate and very focused on that. But we wouldn't do at a level 


--
 
they don't start and begin on 
Janu
ary 1 and close on December 31. They're multiyear processes. So we 
look at the total bag of earnings. We look at the various charges that we 
make. You could make arguments that you could extract legal reserves. You 
could extract restructuring of businesses
, whether it be FrontPoint or other 
businesses. We look at the total mix, and then when we deal with what 
we've got on our net revenue base, that's how we think about comps. So I 
kind of cherry pick in that regard the CICC [ph] (0:48:12) as good revenue 
is
 
generated through the wherewithal of folks at this firm, and that's 
something we felt very comfortable compensating on.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
In Asset Management in the quarter, and you sort of spoke to this, the ratio 
of the payout in non
-
c
ontrolling interest as a percentage of the investment 
revenue that you showed was a lot lower. It was about 28% in the fourth 
quarter. It was almost half in the third. Can you just explain to us why the 
shift?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think I'm going to need to get ba
ck to you on that one.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch
 
It's just sort of as we look forward and try to model revenues ahead. It's just 
useful to have that. And then, the final question I have for you is, was there 
any significant change in the cash
-
ver
sus
-
equity component or mix of 
compensation this year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in our compensation, we did increase the deferral. But when we talk 
about deferred comp, we talk about both deferring cash and deferring stock. 
And so, the overall mix was pretty much the
 
same with higher deferrals.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
I just want to come back to the sort of thick buildout and looking at some of 
the personnel changes and folks you m
oved around, to what extent does 
that sort of stretch out timelines or doesn't it? I mean, does that sort of 
impact just given the magnitude as the reporting line changes going on?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. I think I've said it a couple of times now. This is the firs
t of a two
-
year 
steady build. Colm left this seat a year ago. And we've been really building 
out the team. It does take time, but we are 
--
 
I'm going to repeat it, it's the 
first of a two
-
year steady build 
--
 
I apologize, completed the first of a two
-
year 
steady build.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
But then just coming back to the other comments, I think the change you 
made about sort of growth or headcount because you're not really hiring. So 

ve sort of a buildout 
going on? But assuming there'll be some turnover in the process, is that kind 
of how you think about it?
 
James Gorman
 
I wouldn't. I mean, as I look at the businesses, I think institutional 
securities. We hired about 70% of our total p
lan last year. We sort of pulled 
the curtain over at about in August. And there are a couple of areas where 
we didn't quite get done what we want to get done. And a couple of our 
support areas, particularly in Risk and Technology, where 
--
 
but these are 
ve
ry small numbers. In Wealth Management, I mean, we're carrying 
something like 2,000 contractors working on the integration. I think that's 
now pretty much, if not running at peak, pretty much at peak. And I think 
our financial advisor head count will stay 
in the band that Ruth put out, 17.5 
to 18.5. It may be down a couple of hundred from this year, it may not be. I 

long as it stays in that band. And Asset Management, some of the me
rchant 
banking businesses, we've had a lot of success in Asia and in our 
Infrastructure business. But they're small numbers. So I think you're 
probably 
--
 
we haven't actually sat down and laid out our headcount plan for 
the firm. But I would say, the aggre
gate picture would be roughly flat. I'd be 
surprised if it's up much. We're certainly not anticipating any big riff or 
anything of that nature.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, selectively [ph] (0:52:12).
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
And then just coming back to the que
stion on the net interest income in the 
bank. The other I guess thing that sort of popped out at us or I've noticed 
that is that the net interest income in the Institutional Securities business 

ndering if 
there's any connection between the two, like transfer pricing of any sort or 
anything.
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, there's not a connection. And in Institutional Securities, as you know, it's 
more of a 
--
 
NIM is more of a banking book than a trading book con
cept. 
And so, across [ph] (52:53) in Institutional Securities is really driven by our 
trading and derivatives activities that have an interest component. So we 
think of that business holistically, there's not a link between the NIM 
discussion we'd have the
re and the NIM in TW [ph] (53:03).
 
James Gorman
 
And the way we report it in Wealth Management, we manage it internally. 
There are two separate 
--
 
there's the BDP [ph] (53:10), the deposit spreads, 
and then there's the net interest margin on the core 
loan book.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
The tax rate, can you give us any sort of comments on the go forward? I 
mean, it's been low and I understand it jumps around quarter to quarter, 
depending on sort of levels of net income and credit, and if not [p
h] (53:31) 
you could get. Just kind of look at it on the aggregate. I mean, you still 
generated $6 billion of pretax profit, not a small amount in 2010. And to the 
extent that goes up, I mean do you have enough of these short of shields to 
keep the tax rat
e unusually low?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. We do our tax planning annually. So if you just exclude the discrete 
items from 2010, the effective annual tax rate from continuing operations 
would've been about 28%. And as we look forward to 2011, we suggest that 
you look
 
at the statutory tax rate. So it's about 35%. Something less than 
35% would be the right way to look at it for 2011.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
Last question, given the charge on FrontPoint, can you say where that's 
carried now on the book?
 
Ruth Por
at
 
Again, the backdrop is our overall strategy in this area to free up capital and 
merchant banking activity [indiscernible] (54:27), we're continuing to do 
that. But with respect to FrontPoint specifically, we're continuing to 
restructure our ownership to
 
a minority stake. Given the events last quarter 
and with the lower AUM, there were some changes to the deal terms. We did 
take a higher charge in the fourth quarter. It was $126 million, if I recall 
correctly.
 
Roger Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
But presumab
ly, to the extent that assets continue to flow out, that can 
continue to be revised, I guess, is the assumption?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The carrying value as of the fourth quarter is $30 million, just so you have 
that.
 
Operator
 
The final question will come from Mike C
arrier from Deutsche Bank.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
One follow
-
up on the Wealth Management business, and the clarity around 

of consolidating the platforms, the remaining
 
synergies and I think the last 
time you guys gave the number, there was about, you made $400 million or 
$500 million less. But if we just look at that and assume that, that gets done 
at some point at the end of this year beginning of next year, then if we
 
just 
run those synergies through the model, based on what you can control, can 
you still get that pretax margin to, like, the mid
-
teen level, call it 15, 16, 17? 
And then basically, whether it's the rates, the markets, the scenarios that 
you gave there, w
ould be able to push you above that 20% level? I'm just 
trying to figure out what you guys can still control.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think you 
--
 
I went through the building blocks, and I think you've just 
articulated it well. Getting through the spend is an importa
nt part of it. 
We're still very much on track with the platform for the third quarter of this 
year and moving the Morgan Stanley FAs over the third quarter. We'll be 
training the Smith Barney FAs through the fourth quarter and starting to 
move over again n
ext year. So there is some spend that continues. That's an 
important element of it, and building up the lending book, as we've talked 
about, is an important element of it to get comp
-
detectable revenues to 
increase. So again, driving towards that 20% PBT m
argin, over time, market 
dependent.
 
James Gorman
 
I mean I know I a lot of folks are very curious about the margin as we are. 
To be honest, it doesn't give us a whole lot of anxiety. This business used to 
have under $6 billion of revenues and had 7%, 8% mar
gin. And now has 
revenues of over $12.5 billion. So you understand fixed cost, you 
understand the arithmetic in some normalized markets. [indiscernible] 
(57:05). Frankly, that's not a big anxiety for us.
 
Ruth Porat
 
In fact, where we're more focused is that
 
it really helps us have a very 
attractively diversified revenue stream by business and product and 
geography. And we've talked a lot on this call about capital. Some are more 
capital
-
intensive businesses like TWM [ph] (57:22), Banking, Asset 
Management, a
re more capital
-
light. So it's really, in the aggregate, the 
portfolio that is, in our view, one of the most important elements.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
And then just based on your capital ratios, and we'll all come up with our 
valuation for the
 
buy in for MFSD [ph] (57:40). But if you look at the 
amount of capital that you're going to generate through 2012 and then if 
you look at just normal leverage ratios, do you have any sense in terms of 
how much you would be paying in equity versus cash or 
debt?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
And then last one, just on the Fixed Income side, on the legacy issues in 
terms of the monoline, like what's the timing on that? And is there any way 
to either restructure 
--
 
basically, how much is 
that going to weigh on the 
earnings? And then on the core business, is it 
--
 
like, 2010 more getting the 
people in place from a products, and then 2011 is more gaining traction with 
clients?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So on the monoline point, it is a legacy exposure. It'
s going to take time to 
work out, so I would just refer you to all the details that's in the K and was 
in the Q last quarter. In terms of your key issue there in terms of kind of the 
ongoing implementation in Sales and Trading, 2010 was about adding talent
 
and structure around the way we cover clients and drive client relationships 
deeper. As we've talked about before, we have strength in a lot of our 
franchises across a lot of clients with this brand globally. And the strengths 
that we have, and it is just
 
continuing to execute. And so, adding talent to a 
platform was an important element of it. But I wouldn't like to suggest we 
did one last year. We're doing the other this way. We had signs of market 
share improvement in the fourth quarter, as I said, that
 
we are driving to 
bottom
-
line results that we can talk about, hopefully, in the not
-
too
-
distant 
future. But we are consistently executing, adding talent and driving 
relationships across our clients, and that's really what's very important in 
the fixed inc
ome move, closing the gaps in certain of the areas, building on 
the strengths in many of the others. Thank you, and thank you all for being 
on the call today.

James Gorman
 
Well, thank you, operator, for that fulsome introduction. And good morning, 
everyone and thank you for joining us.
 
Before we review our financial results, I'd like to do two things: review our 
accomplishments in 2010 
overall and for each business and provide a brief 
outlook. In 2010, Morgan Stanley participated in nearly every signature 
transaction to raise capital and helped reinvigorate the markets. Whether it 
was the GM and Citi IPOs in the U.S., ABC in China, and P
etrobras in Brazil, 
among many others, Morgan Stanley was a skilled and trusted adviser to 
governments, corporations and investors as we work to restore economic 
growth and create new investment opportunities around the world.
 
In Institutional Securities, 
we finished at or near the top of the league tables 
in M&A, global equity and IPOs. A great testament to the teamwork between 
Investment Banking, global capital markets and equities. It's Morgan Stanley 
at our best.
 
We also saw market share improvements in
 
our Equity Sales and Trading 
business. Clearly, we face difficult markets in 2010. Our results reflect that 
more work needs to be done in some of our fixed
-
income businesses. While 
our strategy in this business remains intact, we bolstered our efforts thr
ough 
the following organizational changes, including Ken deRegt as Head of Global 
Fixed Income Sales and Trading based in the U.S., and as a result, Keiki 
(sic) [Keiko] Otsuki will serve as interim Chief Risk Officer.
 
To better align our business and geogr
aphic objectives, which we will also do 
in reinforcing our efforts in fixed income. Colm Kelleher, in addition, to 
running sales and trading, will assume coverage of Europe, the Middle East 
and non
-
Japan Asia and will now be based in London. And Paul Taubm
an, in 
addition to running Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking will 
assume coverage of Latin America and Japan and will remain in New York.
 
In Global Wealth Management [GWM], we've also made some additional 
organization changes driven by Charlie 
Johnston's decision to retire at the 
end of this year. Charlie will continue through the end of the year as Vice 
Chairman of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, and Greg Fleming will become 
President of GWM in addition to Asset Management. Jim Rosenthal was 
appoi
nted Chief Operating Officer in the firm in January and continues in his 
role in the integration of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
 
Overall, these management changes reflect our desire for superior execution 
and our belief in what the future environment deman
ds from our leadership 
as well as obviously the departure of Tom Nides, our former Chief Operating 
Officer, who has moved to serve in Washington.
 
With regard to the Smith Barney integration, we're pleased with our 
progress. We remain on track as evidenced 
by the increased profitability this 
quarter and net new money for the full year. Revenues and margins will 
continue to improve as individual investors further engage.
 
In Asset Management, we refocused the business around our core 
institutional and merchant
 
banking franchises, added talent and addressed 
the issues posed by a distressed global real estate market.
 
Globally, our colleagues in Japan worked hard to launch our strategic joint 
venture with Mitsubishi Bank, a partnership that is already starting to 
pay 
important dividends in terms of our ability to serve clients. And with the sale 
of CICC stake, we are poised to start a new chapter on the very strong 
relationships we've built in China and across Asia for many years. We're 
currently pursuing a domesti
c license in China and recently received 
approval to form a new investment banking joint venture with Huaxin 
Securities, also known as China Fortune Securities.
 
In Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Australia, our people on the 
ground are capitaliz
ing on the Morgan Stanley brand to take advantage of 
the many opportunities we now see.
 
Overall, we've made progress executing our strategy despite challenging 
market conditions this year. We remain confident as evidenced by our 
success in investment banki
ng equities, our disciplined approach with Smith 
Barney and our substantial improvement in Asset Management. Looking 
forward, we continue to focus on growing revenue, earnings and ROE in each 
of our businesses.
 
Our priorities for 2011 and 2012 include: Wit
hin Institutional Securities, 
obviously, improving our results within Fixed Income Sales and Trading and 
maintaining our leadership positions in Investment Banking and Equity Sales 
and Trading; within Global Wealth Management, growing our Transaction 
and A
dvisory business, increasing deposit and lending revenues, and after 
the completion of the integration in 2012, to see commensurate cost 
reduction; within Asset Management, monetizing our strong investment 
performance in the core business and optimizing ou
r expenses.
 
Let me turn to compensation. A year ago, we explicitly said you would not 
see the same compensation ratios in 2009 and we did not. The full
-
year ratio 
was 51%, down from 62% a year ago, which was in part driven by 
extremely high DVA. In absolut
e terms, full
-
year compensation was higher 
due to the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney completion of 12 months and the 
investment in sales and trading.
 
We also demonstrated discipline through our compensation structure. In fact 
our high deferral rates and call
-
backs balanced prudence with incentives, 
which were important to shareholder considerations. This management team 
is intently focused on improving earnings and ROE, and in the process, we 
will reward our shareholders and our employees.
 
Thank you. Now I'll 
turn over to Ruth to review our financial results in more 
detail, and we will both be available for question and answer.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, James. For the quarter ended December 31, income from 
continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley was 
$867 million, with 
diluted earnings per share of $0.43 after preferred dividends.
 
There were four factors that drove our results this quarter. First, ongoing 
strength in Investment Banking and Equity Sales and Trading, historically 
very strong areas for us
. Second, subdued results in Fixed Income, where 
we continue to work on our turnaround. Third, notable progress in both 
Global Wealth Management and Asset Management. And finally, strategic 
asset sales and expense discipline.
 
Our fourth quarter revenues of
 
$7.8 billion included two noteworthy items: a 
$668 million or $0.17 per share gain from the sale of CICC; and negative 
$945 million or $0.36 per share impact from the tightening of credit spreads 
on firm
-
issued structured notes, commonly referred to as DV
A.
 
This quarter, DVA was driven by a larger outstanding balance, a longer 
weighted
-
average maturity and further maturity extension in a portion of our 
notes. The full
-
year firm
-
wide compensation ratio was 51%. Excluding 
negative DVA of $873 million and the
 
U.K. bonus tax of $272 million, the 
ratio would have been 49%.
 
Non
-
compensation expenses increased 12% sequentially, including higher 
technology and legal cost. For the full year, non
-
compensation expenses 
were up roughly 7% annually, normalizing for 12 m
onths of Smith Barney. 
The increase was driven by higher business activity as well as our ongoing 
investments in technology. Notably, book value at the end of the quarter 
was $31.49 per share, up 16% for the year.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets
 
were $808 billion at December 31, 
down $34 billion sequentially, driven by lower client activity. Although our 
calculations are not yet final, we believe our Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel I 
will be 16%, and our Tier 1 common ratio will be 10.5%, demons
trating the 
strength of our balance sheet. Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are 
expected to be approximately $328 billion at December 31. Now turning to 
our businesses.
 
Institutional Securities revenues of $3.6 billion included the impact of CICC 
and DVA
 
as mentioned earlier. Noninterest expenses were $3.2 billion in the 
quarter, up 20% from the third quarter on higher compensation and the 
seasonality of non
-
compensation expenses.
 
For the full year, noninterest expenses increased slightly. The full
-
year 
c
ompensation ratio was 43%, excluding negative DVA of $873 million and 
the U.K. bonus tax of $269 million, the ratio would've been 40%. The 
business reported a pretax profit of $437 million.
 
Investment Banking revenues were $1.5 billion, up 50% from last qu
arter. 
For 2010, Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global IPOs, number one in 
global equity and number two in both global
-
completed and global
-
announced M&A. For the year, we advised on eight of the top 10 announced 
M&A transactions. In the quarter, we w
ere a book runner on all five of the 
top five transactions in global equity and four of the top five transactions in 
global IPOs.
 
Advisory revenues of $484 million were up 30% sequentially, driven by 
higher activity in EMEA and the Americas. Significant an
nounced M&A 
transactions in the quarter were the $21 billion combination of Weather 
Investments and VimpelCom in Europe and the $10 billion restructuring of 
Westfield Group in Australia.
 
Equity Underwriting revenues were $661 million, our highest reported 
quarter. We saw improvement across all regions. Asia, once again was 
particularly strong with notable offerings, including AIA's $21 billion IPO, 
PETRONAS Chemical Group's $5 billion IPO and China Rongsheng Heavy 
Industries' $2 billion IPO.
 
Fixed
-
income Un
derwriting revenues of $370 million were relatively flat to 
last quarter, as lower bond issuance was largely offset by higher loan 
syndication fees. Overall, our Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy 
across products and regions.
 
Equity sales and trad
ing revenues of $1.1 billion included negative DVA of 
$103 million. Cash equity revenues increased sequentially on higher client 
activity and increased market share. Derivatives revenues, similarly 
improved given a more stable volatility environment and in
creased client 
flows, and prime brokerage revenues increased from the third quarter as we 
continue to deepen relationships with our existing clients. Average client 
balances continued to grow, up 11% sequentially.
 
Fixed income sales and trading negative re
venues of $29 million included 
negative DVA of $842 million. Interest Rate, Credit and Currency revenues 
were down from last quarter across all businesses. Commodities revenues 
were relatively flat to the third quarter as lack of market volatility continue
d 
to dampen client activity. Our results also continue to reflect a drag from the 
tightening of monoline credit spreads.
 
Turning to VaR, average trading VaR declined to $132 million from $142 
million last quarter, primarily driven by reductions in interest
 
rates and 
credit. Average non
-
trading VaR decreased to $95 million from $103 million, 
primarily due to the sale of our equity stake in Invesco.
 
Global Wealth Management revenues of $3.4 billion increased 8% 
sequentially as higher commissions, asset manage
ment fees and net interest 
income more than offset lower trading revenues.
 
Commissions increased 31% from last quarter as higher client activity was 
driven by new issuance and secondary trading. Noninterest expenses were 
$3 billion, up 5% from last quarter
, both on a higher non
-
compensation and 
compensation expenses. Integration costs were approximately $63 million. 
The compensation ratio of 59% in the fourth quarter continues to be driven 
primarily by the formulaic grid payout. However, the lower ratio thi
s quarter 
reflects reductions in non
-
FA compensation, which is not likely sustainable in 
the near term.
 
Profit before tax was $390 million, and the PBT margin was 12%, up from 
9% last quarter. Total client assets increased 4% sequentially to $1.7 trillion 
on market appreciation and net asset inflows of $14.1 billion in the quarter. 
Net new money for the year was $22.9 billion. The number of FAs was 
18,043, within our expected range of 17,500 to 18,500, while turnover 
within our top two quintiles, remained i
n line with historical lows. Deposits in 
our Bank Deposit Program were $113 billion, all of which $55 billion is held 
by Morgan Stanley banks.
 
Asset Management net revenues of $858 million increased 7% from the third 
quarter. Core Asset Management revenues
 
of $410 million included higher 
asset management fees and increased gains on seed investments as well as 
a $126 million impairment charge related to the restructuring of FrontPoint 
and a $96 million gain on the sale of our equity stake in Invesco.
 
Merchan
t Banking revenues of $448 million included investment gains in real 
estate and private equity. Approximately $109 million was related to 
investment gains from consolidated Nasref [ph] (22:29) funds. Given the 
ownership structure of these funds, the majori
ty of the gains are passed to 
third
-
party investors in the non
-
controlling interest line. Approximately $95 
million of the principal investment gains were from private equity, primarily 
driven by Asian investments. Noninterest expenses for Asset Management
 
declined 4% from last quarter on lower compensation and non
-
compensation 
expenses. PBT was $356 million for a margin of 41%.
 
Total AUM increased slightly to $279 billion, primarily due to higher market 
levels. Asset flows were negative $600 million during
 
the quarter, primarily 
driven by $1.5 billion of outflows related to FrontPoint. As of December 
2010, over 70% of our long
-
term strategies continue to outperform their 
respective benchmarks on a three
-
, five
-
 
and 10
-
year basis.
 
Now turning to our outlook.
 
We are increasingly encouraged by the pace of 
the recovery as reflected in capital markets activity. Key indicators include: 
strengthening equity markets, improving corporate confidence reflected in 
M&A activity, successful equity issuances across industr
ies globally, higher 
investor activity and ongoing growth in emerging markets. That said, the 
potential for more policy intervention that drove the risk on, risk off investor 
sentiment last year remains due to both macroeconomic issues and ongoing 
regulato
ry implementation. Sovereign credit concerns in Europe continue to 
be at the forefront.
 
And in the U.S., distressed state and local budgets as well as the deficit 
remain open items. Inflation risk in emerging markets could also elicit policy 
moves. And on 
regulation, added clarity regarding certain elements of Basel 
and Dodd
-
Frank are helpful, although final rules are clearly still in formation.
 
While our overall performance is dependent on the global market 
environment, we believe we are well positioned fo
r the evolving regulatory 
regime, with an emphasis on client
-
focused businesses supported by 
appropriate capital and liquidity. Our growing client footprint and 
investments across the firm are key to leveraging the strengths we have 
across many of our busi
nesses and closing gaps and others, with disciplined 
investment and implementation proceeding performance.
 
Looking forward, we are focused on growing our share of the market by 
leveraging our global brand and client franchise to provide the highest 
quality
 
service to clients and stronger returns to our stakeholders.
 
Thank you. And now we will take your questions.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Howard Chen 
with Credit Suisse.
 
Howard Chen

Crédit Suisse AG
 
James, 
you spoke to more work to be done in fixed income to drive revenue 
and market share growth. Other than the announced management changes, 
could you just give us maybe your top three action items to get there? I get 
a lot of questions from investors on what 
exactly is the limiting factor in 
closing that gap.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Why don't I go ahead on that. As James said, as I said, we're in the first of a 
two
-
year steady build of that business. And as we've talked about in the 
past, our view is that we were subscale 
and although we had a good mix of 
structure solutions and flow business, we really needed to build out the flow 
business more. And that's really the conversation we've been having about 
rates and foreign exchange. And so, we built out that footprint, we're
 
building flow. But when you look at this quarter, there's really a bit of a 
virtuous cycle with broader, deeper footprint allowing more efficient trading 
to support our client activity. And so really, with the buildout of our 
footprint, we're leveraging t
he strength we have across Institutional 
Securities with clients to drive those relationships deeper. But it is the first 
of a two
-
year steady build.

1/21/15,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Celeste Mellet Brown, Head of Investor Relations at 
Morgan Stanley. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call.
 
Today's presentation may include forward
-
looking statements, which reflect 
management's current estimates or 
beliefs and are subject to risks and 
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
 
The presentation may also include certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. 
Please see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation on 
such n
on
-
GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a 
discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future 
results of Morgan Stanley.
 
This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be 
duplicated or reproduc
ed without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell 
any security or investment.
 
I will now turn over the call to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. Ruth and I will now 
address 
our performance during the quarter.
 
As you're all aware, tremendous political uncertainty in the second quarter 
was detrimental to the global capital markets, resulting in a very challenging 
environment for all aspects of our business. Weak demand 
flows and difficult 
conditions contributed to results in sales and trading. The environment for 
investment banking was likewise affected by the market backdrop. However, 
we maintained our top
-
tier rankings in announced M&A and global IPOs as 
well as a lead
ing position in global equities. We continued to have 
momentum in equity capital markets and recently won several significant 
lead mandates that should enhance earnings once the fog of macro 
uncertainty lifts.
 
GWM evidenced revenue and profitability resili
ence in a very challenging 
environment for retail investors. Despite the macro pressures that weighed 
on both retail engagement and new issue activity, revenues were 
commensurate with the prior quarter while margins improved to 12%, 
reflecting the benefits
 
of the cost focus in that business.
 
We also reached a major milestone for Morgan Stanley in the wealth 
management industry with the culmination of the MSSB integration. The 
integration was substantially completed on July 8, and we can now finally 
look for
ward to the benefits of a fully harmonized business with significant 
scale. Our Wealth Management business will considerably increase its value 
to our clients and financial advisors through superior functionality and to our 
shareholders through enhanced an
d stable earnings.
 
Performance in traditional asset management held up and flows were again 
strong.
 
Finally, our results evidenced continued comp and non
-
comp expense 
discipline across the firm with expenses down 17% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We remain resolute in o
ur commitment to maximize firm value and continue 
to shape our business for its success. There are 6 specific areas that 
represent new or continued steps in this regard, and I would now like to 
touch on each one. First, we persist in our efforts to optimiz
e our balance 
sheet and business mix to best serve our clients. As you know, we have a 
strong Basel III capital ratio. We have reduced our Fixed Income and 
Commodities risk
-
weighted assets significantly since 2009 and by 15% alone 
since the end of the thir
d quarter 2011. The reduction in risk
-
weighted 
assets has been driven by active management, including resolving legacy 
issues such as MBIA as well as passive runoff of all positions. We continue to 
reshape our Fixed Income businesses away from more complex
 
structured 
product businesses to high
-
velocity, flow
-
oriented products. We intend to 
shrink these risk
-
weighted assets more dramatically through a combination 
of passive mitigation and active business unit management. By the end of 
2013, we expect to driv
e fixed income risk
-
weighted assets to levels at least 
25% below those at the third quarter 2011 and 30% below by the end of 
2014, subject to final rules and regulatory changes. And we will continue to 
look for ways to drive additional value in this busine
ss.
 
As I've said repeatedly, we're driving towards the right set of Fixed Income 
businesses for Morgan Stanley, those that makes sense to our client 
footprint and complement our strong equities and banking franchises.
 
Second initiative. As I've also said b
efore, we believe the scale economics 
and extraordinarily 
--
 
are extraordinarily important in wealth management 
as they are the key drivers to returns. As a result, we're taking steps to 
unlock value in our wealth management businesses outside of North 
Ame
rica, starting with the recently completed Quilter sale. Across non
-
Japan 
Asia, we will align Wealth Management with the Institutional Equities and 
Investment Banking units to realize inherent cost synergies and revenue 
synergies among those businesses. We
 
also have plans to align our Latin 
American Wealth Management business with our U.S. efforts. In doing so, 
these advisors and clients will move to the integrated platform, which now 
supports U.S.
-
based clients and allows us to further leverage the U.S. sc
ale, 
service spreads and sophistication.
 
And finally and importantly, in the European Wealth Management business, 
we're considering an array of strategic alternatives to enhance profitability. 
These moves should be incremental to the improvements we've alr
eady 
discussed in the past in GWM.
 
Thirdly, we will remain vigilant in regards to all expenses as we have 
demonstrated over the past several quarters. Non
-
compensation expenses 
should further decline in the coming 12 months as expenses from the MSSB 
integr
ation run off and as we actively manage our expense base across the 
rest of the firm.
 
Fourthly, we are focused on headcount and expect to end 2012 
approximately 7% lower across the firm than the end of 2011, driven by a 
combination of previously announced 
reductions in force as well as applying 
a very high bar for replacing natural attrition.
 
Fifthly, our partnership with MUFG deepens every day and across all our 
businesses. We continue to work with our joint venture partners to identify 
opportunities to wo
rk together around the world. For example, in the second 
quarter, we and our partners executed a joint bridge loan facility for a 
leading diversified retailer in Latin America. Morgan Stanley then went on to 
act as an active joint book runner for the same 
company's IPO.
 
Sixth and finally, we expect to complete the acquisition of the next 14% of 
MSSB in September.
 
As is plainly evident in our results, the market and our circumstances were 
challenging in the second quarter. While it is still early days, we ar
e seeing 
some signs of improvement in the third quarter.
 
I'll now turn it over to Ruth to take you through our earnings in detail.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the 
effect of DVA. We have provided reconcili
ations in the footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures.
 
DVA in the quarter was positive $350 million with $74 million in equity sales 
and trading and $276 million in Fixed Income sales and trading.
 
Excluding the impact of DVA,
 
firm
-
wide revenues were $6.6 billion, down 
26% sequentially. Noninterest expenses were $6 billion, down 11% versus 
the first quarter. Compensation expenses were $3.6 billion this quarter, 
down 18% sequentially, reflecting not only our view for the quarter
 
but also 
our financial outlook for the year. Non
-
compensation expenses were $2.4 
billion, up 3% from last quarter, reflecting seasonality, but were down 9% 
year
-
over
-
year. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan 
Stanley common shareholder
s were approximately $312 million. Earnings 
from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.16 after preferred 
dividends.
 
On a reported or GAAP basis, firm
-
wide revenues for the first quarter were 
$7 billion, roughly flat to last quarter. Earnings fro
m continuing operations 
applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were approximately 
$536 million. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share 
were $0.28 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter 
was $31.02 p
er share. Tangible book value was $27.70 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 4 of the supplement. Total assets were 
$754 billion at June 30, down from $781 billion last quarter, reflecting lower 
levels of client activity. Our liquidity reserve 
was $173 billion at the end of 
the quarter versus $179 billion last quarter. Our liquidity levels reflected an 
additional $6.5 billion reduction in debt outstanding in the quarter and $21 
billion in the last 12 months, as well as $2.9 billion of collateral
 
outflows 
associated with recent ratings actions. Deposits were up again this quarter 
to $68 billion from $66 billion. Although our calculations are not final, we 
believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 
13.5% and our Tier 1
 
capital ratio will be approximately 17.1%. Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $317 billion 
at June 30. Subject to final rule
-
making but incorporating the recently 
codified Basel 2.5 guidance and our best estimate of the ne
w Basel III NPR, 
our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was just under 8.5% as of the end 
of the second quarter, assuming full Basel III inflation of risk
-
weighted 
assets and 0 benefit from future mitigation. We expect that our Tier 1 
common ratio under B
asel III at the end of 2012 will be around 9%, 
reflecting continuing passive mitigation driven by position roll
-
off and 
consensus earnings with a modest benefit from the more active Fixed 
Income RWA management that James discussed.
 
Now turning to our 
businesses in detail. Unless otherwise noted, all 
discussion of income statement metrics and segment results will exclude 
DVA for the remainder of my remarks in order to differentiate revenues 
associated with our business from those associated with our bor
rowings that 
result solely from our credit spreads.
 
In Institutional Securities, revenues were $2.9 billion, down 42% 
sequentially. Noninterest expenses were $2.7 billion, down 18% versus the 
first quarter. The compensation ratio was 49%. Non
-
compensation 
expenses 
increased 6% from last quarter due to seasonality. The business reported a 
pretax profit of $158 million.
 
In Investment Banking, revenues of $884 million were up 4% versus last 
quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in glo
bal 
IPOs, #2 in global announced M&A at the end of the second quarter. Notable 
transactions included, in equity underwriting, the $16 billion IPO for 
Facebook and the $3 billion IPO for Felda Global Ventures which are the 2 
largest IPOs priced globally thi
s year. In advisory, Anheuser
-
Busch InBev's 
$20 billion acquisition of Grupo Modelo SAB. And in debt underwriting, the 
$5 billion investment grade debt offering for GlaxoSmithKline capital.
 
Advisory revenues of $263 million were down 16% versus the first q
uarter, 
driven by lower fees across all regions. Equity underwriting revenues were 
$283 million, a 65% increase from the first quarter, reflecting stronger 
revenues in the Americas, partially offset by modest issuance levels in 
Europe. Fixed Income underwr
iting revenues of $338 million were down 8% 
versus last quarter, reflecting lower revenues from investment grade and 
high
-
yield issuance, partially offset by stronger loan syndication fees.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues were $1.14 billion, a decrease o
f 38% 
from last quarter. Results reflect challenging markets and lower industry
-
wide liquidity and volume. Despite lower volumes, our client franchise 
remains strong as evidenced by increased market share across most 
products. Prime brokerage revenues incr
eased sequentially and at a faster 
rate than balance growth.
 
Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues were $770 
million. Revenues were down 70% versus our strong first quarter results. 
Results in the quarter primarily reflect a challenging m
arket and lower levels 
of client activity. Results also reflect meaningfully lower revenues from 
commodities after a strong first quarter that included a number of structured 
solutions for clients. Finally, results include period
-
specific items associated 
with the ratings action of approximately $225 million.
 
The other sales and trading line reflects negative revenues of $11 million 
compared with negative $286 million last quarter. Included in other sales 
and trading net revenue is the net positive impact o
f $76 million for 
adjustments related to certain derivative positions not qualifying as hedges 
of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries.
 
Turning to VAR. Our average aggregated VAR by primary risk category for 
the quarter was $81 million versus $7
2 million in the first quarter and $135 
million in the prior year. Period
-
end total VAR was $85 million at the end of 
the second quarter compared to $78 million at the end of the first quarter. 
Average total VAR was $91 million this quarter versus $84 mill
ion in the first 
quarter using a 4
-
year data series.
 
Turning to Global Wealth Management. Revenues of $3.3 billion were down 
3% versus the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower retail activity. Asset 
management revenues were up 7%, benefiting from highe
r asset levels at 
the end of the first quarter. Transactional revenues declined 19% from last 
quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $531 million, which 
decreased 16% from last quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity, 
Investment Banking
-
related fees of $223 million, which increased 9% versus 
last quarter, driven by particularly strong activity in closed
-
end funds and 
trading revenues of $222 million, which were down 40% versus the first 
quarter, reflecting markdowns in deferred compensati
on plans.
 
Noninterest expenses were $2.9 billion, down 4% from last quarter. The 
compensation ratio was 60% versus 62% in the first quarter. Non
-
compensation expenses were $918 million, flat to the last quarter. Expenses 
related to the integration were $79
 
million in the quarter and will decline 
from here.
 
Profit before tax was $393 million while the PBT margin was 12%, up from 
last quarter despite a decline in revenues, reflecting our expense control 
efforts in this business. The $61 million gain from disc
ontinued operations 
after
-
tax includes a $108 million pretax gain from the previously announced 
sale of Quilter. NCI for the quarter was $81 million, up slightly from $74 
million in the first quarter. NCI this quarter includes $8 million related to 
Quilter
.
 
Total client assets decreased slightly to $1.7 trillion due to market 
depreciation. Global fee
-
based asset inflows were $4 billion. Fee
-
based 
assets under management declined to $526 billion at quarter end due to 
market depreciation but were up 6% year
-
o
ver
-
year. Global representatives 
at quarter end were 16,934.
 
Bank deposits were $112 billion at the end of the quarter with approximately 
$58 billion held in Morgan Stanley banks. As James mentioned, we have 
reached a major milestone in this business. The 
integration was substantially 
completed 2 weeks ago when we moved the final wave of Smith Barney 
Financial Advisors onto the new platform. The final transition was executed 
on plan. In the 3 waves of legacy Smith Barney Financial Advisor and client 
migrati
on that started in February, we transferred over $900 billion in 
assets, 7 years of transaction history comprised of approximately 2 billion 
documents and over 47 million client positions.
 
Additionally, the transition included significant training for empl
oyees 
moving onto the new platform, which enhances both the financial advisor 
and client experience.
 
Asset Management revenues of $456 million were down from $533 million in 
the first quarter, due primarily to lower valuations. In Traditional Asset 
Managem
ent, revenues of $337 million were flat compared to the first 
quarter. In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $122 million were down 16% 
versus last quarter. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the 
majority of these revenues are passed to third
-
p
arty investors in the 
noncontrolling interest line. In Merchant Banking, revenues were negative $3 
million compared with positive $45 million in the first quarter, driven 
primarily by markdowns in Asia. Compensation expense was $214 million in 
the quarter,
 
down from $218 million in the first quarter. Profit before tax 
was $43 million, down from $128 million last quarter. NCI was $23 million 
versus $65 million last quarter. And total AUM increased to $311 billion, 
driven by net inflows of $13 billion, partia
lly offset by market depreciation.
 
In conclusion, results in the second quarter reflect a challenging market 
backdrop. We expect markets will continue to be affected by slow global 
growth and the challenges in the Eurozone. However, some of the more 
Morgan
 
Stanley
-
specific issues are receding and we look forward to more 
business
-
as
-
usual performance. As James commented at the outset, we are 
further driving returns in our business through actions including ongoing 
emphasis on capital optimization, leveraging
 
economies of scale and wealth 
management, driving further expense and headcount reduction and creating 
greater efficiencies in funding.
 
With respect to business trends in the near to medium term, we expect 
activity levels to remain highest in the Americas
 
followed by Asia. We expect 
the challenges in Europe will continue to weigh on activity levels in the near 
term. However, we look forward to normalcy in Europe at some point given 
the strength of our franchise there. And when the discussion about outlook 
is 
more about economic growth and less about political risks, there's further 
operating leverage in the business. In Investment Banking, we continue to 
benefit from our leadership positions and have a healthy pipeline. In our 
trading businesses, we are bec
oming more effective by leveraging 
adjacencies across products and clients as well as investments in 
technology. In retail wealth management, we are pleased to have all of our 
financial advisors integrated on one platform.
 
Thank you for listening, and Jame

[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Roger Freeman 
with Barclays.
 
Roger A. Freeman

Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
I guess 
--
 
thanks for your comments on 
what you think some of the sort of 
direct impact of the Moody's downgrade was. Have you seen 
--
 
was most of 
that, that you could quantify, before the actual downgrades or after and 
have you seen any change in behavior as the full impact of this has settled
 
in?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So there are a couple of pieces to it. The portion that I quantified, the $225 
million, came after the Moody's downgrade. So to be clear, it was associated 
with valuation allowances and contract adjustments. There are a couple of 
items we c
an't quantify. For example, our bankers spend a lot of time with 
clients and counter
-
parties throughout the period, addressing questions they 
may have had and that's time which otherwise would have been spent 
capturing new business. And as the quarter wore
 
on with increasing 
speculation on rates, on the ratings outcome, some clients seemed to take a 
wait
-
and
-
see approach. So those are tougher to quantify but we certainly 
felt, in particular given the elongated deliberation process, that it did weigh 
towards
 
the end of the quarter. Overall, with the ratings action on the sector 
finally resolved, we are seeing real relief and clients have reengaged. It's 
helpful to have that uncertainty addressed.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay. An
d has there been any utilization of clients, particularly like pension 
funds, that are kind of more sensitive to transacting with the bank?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So if you're asking, has much gone into the derivative sub, there's not much 
of note. We have seen an 
acceleration of foreign exchange into the bank. 
We've seen 
--
 
we've been writing more new foreign exchange business in 
the bank.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay. And then just last question on this topic. The collateral postings
, it 
looks like you've posted a little less than half of what you're potentially 
obligated to. Is that just a function of the other half not having been called?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we posted the $2.9 billion. Just to give you an update on the total 
collateral su
bject to call, it's actually a bit lower than in our first quarter Q. 
We had an estimate of $6.8 billion in the first quarter. It's now ballpark 
around $6.3 billion. I think it's fair to say that we've been pleased with the 
pace of call, it's just been ver
y measured, which, in our view, underscores 
that clients have comfort, real comfort, with the firm. Since the end of the 
quarter, in July, we've had another $800 million called. But again this pace 
does seem to be quite measured. We do expect more to be ca
lled going 
forward. Hard to forecast how much that is, but as we've talked about on 
prior calls, we are fully reserved for the full amount of potential collateral call 
and the sizing of our liquidity reserve.
 
Roger A. Freeman

Barclays Capital, Research D
ivision
 
Right, okay. And just last question overall. The 
--
 
you talked about some of 
the 
--
 
some initiatives, streamlining within the units, focus on headcount. 
Any rough quantifications, maybe given current sort of run rates, what that 
-
-
 
what impact or b
enefit they're going to have to run rate expenses?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Howard Chen with Crédit Suisse.
 
Howard Chen

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
James, on Fixed Income, the targets you mentioned at the beginning
 
of the 
call appear like a meaningful strategic shift on the rebuild that, again, before 
you took the helm. The RWA targets are interesting, but it'd be really helpful 
to just hear exactly what and where you want the firm to be in the Fixed 
Income business
es today and how quickly you want to get there, and maybe 
what were some of the drivers of that thinking if, in fact, you agree with 
what I'm saying.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Sure, I'll let Ruth some of the targets on where we are and then I'll let you 
know where w
e're going to end up.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the focus is continuing to be on fixed income optimization. As Colm and 
Kenny have talked about for quite some time, they focus on share capital 
efficiency and cost structure, and we're focused on ensuring that our 
footp
rint is consistent with what we need to do strategically. So we have a 
cohesive suite of products that is consistent with the strength we have 
across our platform, beginning with Investment Banking, what we're doing 
on the institutional equities side and a
 
number of areas within Fixed Income. 
But there are certain businesses within the Fixed Income that may be nice to 
have, but they're not necessary and they're RWA
-
intensive and that's really 
what James was getting at in the reduction in risk
-
weighted asset
s that 
we're focused on driving. So down 15% from the third quarter to the second 
quarter, targeting being down 25% in aggregate by 2013 and we're really 
targeting active business unit management. So this essentially doubles the 
RWA reduction from the busi
ness. I think the other point is as we reduce 
more complex areas, it's not just the capital benefit, but there's a funding 
benefit and an expense benefit as well.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Yes, I'd just add I sort of see it as a couple of different chapters. The fir
st 
was we had some legacy positions that, for the last couple of years we've 
had to deal with, and you have to deal with that artfully. You don't want to 
take unnecessary pain and we've worked our way out of those positions. I 
think the most significant, o
bviously, was the Republic of Italy and the MBIA 
exposures and so on. The second is that we've been building our footprint on 
the flow side of the business, which also has been a couple of years in the 
working. And the third is now adjusting the focus on p
articularly the heavier 
risk
-
weighted asset businesses, which we have been and increasingly have 
been more aggressive on and are reflective of the environment and the 
world as we see it going forward. We've consistently said that our focus is 
going to be o
n the flow, high
-
velocity, lighter risk
-
weighted asset 
businesses. And if anything, that focus has been 
--
 
the dial has been turned 
up on that.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay, great. Understood, that's helpful. Just on the FID RWA r
eduction 
targets, I just want to confirm that's on Basel III basis. And then for starting 
point purposes, what's the FID RWA today on Basel III, Ruth?
 
Ruth Porat
 
That is on a Basel III basis and we 
--
 
what we've been doing is guiding to an 
overall Basel II
I ratio, not breaking out RWAs by business for the firm.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay. The reason I asked, I guess, is if FID is the majority of the firm's RWA 
and let's just say it's $300 billion and you put 10% equity against th
at, 
that's $30 billion and that's larger than the market cap of the company 
today. I'm just curious, is there 
--
 
where are you, James and Ruth, in terms 
of more transformational thinking within the business because that just 
seems incorrect in my opinion.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well I guess there are a couple of points in there. Our risk
-
weighted assets, 
obviously, are across the business, GWM, our MSIM business, in the lending 
business and smaller, obviously, in institutional equities. So we're trying to 
give you a se
nse of the decline in risk
-
weighted assets or more important 
strategically what we're driving within our Fixed Income business.
 
James P. Gorman
 
I would add to it, Howard. I understand exactly what you're saying. If all the 
risk
-
weighted assets and 
capital are tied up in that business, why wouldn't 
we be more aggressive? I think what Ruth is saying is it's not quite as 
simple as that. We have risk
-
weighted assets and capital tied up across the 
firm. That said, in the areas where it is most lumpy and 
has generated the 
least returns, we are being the most aggressive and will be increasingly so. 
It's a balancing act here of not throwing the baby out with the bath water. 
We have some great businesses within Fixed Income and we had obviously a 
very difficu
lt quarter. There's no 
--
 
we're not going to hide from that in Fixed 
Income. It's a tough quarter and a disappointing quarter. But we have some 
great businesses within there and we need to manage that very, very 
carefully going forward, which is what we're
 
doing.

The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
So it was helpful to hear that the business is clearly impacted by the 
potential action from Moody's and given that clients h
ave reengaged was 
hoping maybe you could help us think about how the quarter progressed, 
right? Things seem to have got drawn out by Moody's in June. And so was 
June particularly rough and was a lot of the impact focused in FICC? Can you 
help us think abou
t just year
-
over
-
year how all of that look?
 
Ruth Porat
 
You're absolutely right. I think the elongation of the deliberation really just 
started to weigh on us, clients, counter
-
parties as it dragged on. And June, 
you just felt it was 
--
 
whether it was fatig
ue, waiting, it was 
--
 
we just 
certainly felt it weighing as we got towards the end of the quarter, and we're 
pleased that it finally was resolved. And I think it was exacerbated by the 
ongoing concerns about the Eurozone and just led to speculation about 
what 
the ratings outcome might be. And as I said, clients seemed to take this 
wait
-
and
-
see approach, but it got heavier as it ended. And finally, the third 
week in June finally resolved. So we have seen a real release, as I said, and 
it was primarily affec
ting the Fixed Income business. And so not only did you 
have the weight of kind of clients' wait
-
and
-
see plus our bankers focused on 
trying to ensure they had what they needed, but then the $225 million as we 
have the collateral at that last week or 1.5 we
eks of the month come out.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Right. So if we 
--
 
I mean just looking at that sort of 9 95 [ph], assuming 
thats the sort of adjusted x DVA FICC for that 225, if we make assumptions 
that, okay, June was re
ally weak and then we run rate that, it looks like x 
June, things were sort of closer to the back half of 2011. The reason I'm 
asking or trying to get at this is I'm trying to get at what the actual run rate 
really was in the quarter x this unusual onetime
 
event, which now is 
--
 
as we 
all know is clearly behind you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Right. Well, there were a couple of things. There was the macro backdrop 
and you've added obviously the 225 back appropriately. I think the other 
thing that I noted was our commoditie
s was much weaker. It tends to be a 
lumpy business. We called it out on prior quarters because it's a mix of both 
flow and structured solutions for clients. We had a number of structured 
solutions for clients last quarter. We didn't have any this quarter. 
So the 
drag was exacerbated by the lower results there as well.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay. And then on equities, I noticed that VAR ticked up and the results 
were not so terrific. Were there any positional losses there, o
r is there any 
color in equities on that font?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. Actually, VAR 
--
 
just to address that, VAR was up modestly versus last 
quarter. It was really more in the rates line. But I would say we're 
continuing to run at historically low levels. If I poi
nt you back to the same 
period last quarter and if you look at that line aggregation of primary risk 
category, so it takes out the noise from MBIA last year, we were at the $135 
million of VAR last year, down to $81 million this past quarter. And so we're 
still running at low levels relative to the past prior years, and we think that's 
very prudent. That's the way we're running the business. So wanted just to 
make sure we were clear on that. And then with respect to equities, when 
you see the trading histog
ram for the firm overall, it moved a bit to the left, 
but we did not have trading losses there. We're profitable across the 
businesses it was just lower levels of activity.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay, okay. And then how ab
out PB? Did you 
--
 
was there the similar 
themes to what you highlighted as far as the downgrade where there was a 
great deal of lost productivity and such in that business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Actually in our prime brokerage business, revenues were up, clients were
 
up 
and balances were up. And as I noted in my opening comments, revenues 
outpaced balance growth. So we felt very good about that business.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
That's great. Okay, last one for me. If we could just get a
 
feel for what net 
new assets were in the quarter and maybe if we could put in a request to 
reconsider disclosing that number. I know that you guys are focused on the 
fee
-
paying accounts, but just 
--
 
it'd be helpful just to get a sense of risk 
appetite amo
ng retail investors and the folks that are in the transactional 
business.
 
Ruth Porat
 
The reason we moved to disclosing managed money is that's the way Greg 
Fleming and the team are running the business and we think it gives you a 
better indication of the r
esults in the business. So that's where we're 
managing it and that's why that's what we're disclosing.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay. Any chance to know what the net new assets were this quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I don't have them 
with me.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
A quick one on Commodities first. You mentioned twice the no
-
structured 
solutions in the quarter. Curious if you 
think that's a function of just flat out 
lower prices and less incentive to hedge on behalf of clients?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, as I mentioned, it tends to be a lumpy business and this quarter there 
were fewer of them. We expect the forward quarters there will be s
ome 
more. We're just not going to 
--
 
we don't forecast when they come. So at 
this point, no.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Okay. And then I guess the broader question on FICC and apologize to both 
if I'm misinterpreting this.
 
What I heard was the strategy is pretty similar to 
the past. You've put a lot of the legacy issues behind or if not all of them. 
The strategy sounds very similar. It's that you were going to run a much 
tighter ship on 
--
 
lower RWA and tighter on costs in 
FICC, which I think is 
what people do want. I just don't know if you had the same level of 
confidence in the ability to take share and grow revenues in that business. 
So somewhere in there is a question, I apologize.
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, there was a lot in there
. Look, as I said Colm and Kenny have been 
focused on share capital efficiency and cost discipline. And we put in place 
tight governance around RWA management, so that we can drive down 
those RWA improvements that James articulated. And that's still with t
he 
notion, the key driving factor being what's the strategic suite of products 
that we need to have the strength in our core franchise. And so, again, what 
--
 
you'll see real rigor there and it's not about 
--
 
we look at the business not 
about how big it is
, but about what's the returns in the business and are we 
placed and positioned where we want to be strategically. I think the other 
thing that we're doing is continuing to leverage not just client strength and 
market share positions across our franchise, 
but we're also leveraging what 
we're doing on the technology side. So there's a lot of talk about 
electronification in the market and we're benefiting from, for example, the 
leading MSET platform that we have on the equities side. And what that does 
is it 
helps both execution and analytics. So on the execution side, where 
we're focused 
--
 
and I've talked about this on a number of prior calls, 
markets with discontinuities and rapid throughput, very much in the foreign 
exchange market. I've talked about the i
ncreasing gains that we've had 
there. Derivatives also benefits. We're using or can use our MSET passport 
products to see what's in the SEF to place orders. And we've talked a lot 
about our commitment to central clearing and how we've invested there and 
yo
u've seen some early wins with clients. And technology also, on the 
analytic side, helps improve service. So, for example, transaction cost 
analysis is something that we think is valuable. So what we're doing is 
providing clients with greater transparency 
and hopefully liquidity. But the 
main point here is we're leveraging a real asset we have on the institutional 
equities side to the benefit of where the Fixed Income market is going and 
we're rightsizing what we're doing on the Fixed Income side similarly 
to play 
off of the strengths we have within Institutional Securities.
 
Glenn Schorr

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Okay. Last one, on comp. Obviously, comp ratios get amplified when 
revenues have a tough time, and this is a tough time. But 
it also makes me 
think that sometimes there's a certain floor and so let's maybe just stick 
with Institutional Securities. I hate using that word, but is there a certain 
level that comp can't really go below without something bigger happening? 
And maybe if
 
you could comment on the impact of prior period deferreds.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the way we look at comp is we look at it really again through all the 
levers we have to control to manage the compensation expense as efficiently 
as possible. We 
--
 
and so we accrue 
to an estimate for the full year. 
Obviously, we're only halfway through the year, and relatively strong 
quarters like last quarter we can accrue more dollars and it's at lower rates. 
But that shows really the operating leverage and a better environment. An
d 
then in tough quarters like this we reduce dollars and that underscores the 
cost discipline. But the way we think about is we want to drive returns, we 
want to ensure we can the pay people who are driving returns and we need 
to make sure that we're doing
 
all that we can to use those compensation 
dollars most efficiently. That's why we talked about headcount reductions. 
That's why we established the Office of Re
-
engineering to do things like 
continue to drive location sourcing, moving people who don't need
 
to be in 
centers like New York City to places like our Baltimore outsource location 
here in the States. So again, it's a number of levers that help us drive down 
what's that fixed cost component of it and how do we manage overall the 
compensation expense.
 
Glenn Schorr

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Okay. Just one last important one is, your Basel III is better than everybody 
else for the most part. How will you use that to benefit you? In other words, 
you're going through the process with 
MSSB now. There's going to be a price 
whether you agree on it or it goes through arbitration. How do you balance 
accelerating the rest of MSSB or buying back stock if it has a tangible book? 
What's a better Basel III going to do for you?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We thin
k what a better Basel III and strong capital ratios do for us now is 
underscore the strength of the franchise. What we've done with capital and 
what we've done with liquidity are both, as I've called them in the past, 
really a fortified foundation and that
's a positive for the firm. We think that, 
over time, that will continue to give us greater flexibility with options to 
return capital to shareholders in 
--
 
with the kind of uncertainty in the macro 
environment. I think where we are today is very prudent a
nd with the 
strategic opportunity in front of us, as you said, we have the immediate use 
of capital. But overall, accreting capital gives us degrees of flexibility.

The next question will come from Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.
 
Kian 
Abouhossein

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Could you just briefly discuss NPR2. If that's on an internal basis or 
standardized basis? And within that risk
-
weighted asset Basel III, Basel 2.5 
framework, can you also maybe give us a bit of an indi
cation of how large 
your market risk
-
weighted assets are at this point considering the rules are 
finalized?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. So there's a lot in that question as well. Why don't I start with, first, 
building up our spot in 2012 Basel III and then I'll go t
o the standardized 
approach and hopefully can get most of your questions in that. What we try 
to do is guide conservatively based on our best estimates of the rules as 
they continue to evolve. So at the end of the first quarter, we guided to a 
spot of 8% t
o 9% and obviously the Basel 2.5 rules weren't final at that 
point. And as I said then, the high end of the range assumed the 
international version of Basel 2.5 and the low end assumed our best 
assessment of the most likely worst case interpretation of Bas
el 2.5 NPR. 
And with 2.5 now done, codified, we ended up essentially in the midpoint of 
the range. But since then, the Basel III NPR rules were also introduced and 
we're focused on both the numerator and the denominator and that's what 
led us to our best e
stimate for spot, at the end of the second quarter was 
just under 8.5%. And as I said, that's full Basel III inflation, no mitigation. 
In other words, our second quarter earnings were more than offset by our 
assessment of the change in rules under Basel II
I NPR and that flows 
through as we roll forward to the end of 2012, approximately 9% by year
-
end 2012. And then, as it relates to your question about the standardized 
approach, I think there are 2 questions that keep coming up on standardized 
approach, one
 
being about the Collins floor, and we are well above the 
minimum, which is obviously what the test is about. But I think, what you're 
really getting at is the impact on the correlation book under CRM model 
approval. So assuming we had model approval, our 
Tier 1 common ratio 
would be about 40 basis points higher assuming the book remains the same 
size it is as at the end of the second quarter. We are obviously working hard 
to get model approval, but we have not included the benefit of model 
approval in the 
numbers we've given you given the timing around 
--
 
even 
when you receive here our model approval, you have to wait a year to see 
the benefit. So to the extent 
--
 
I leave it to you whether you add that 40 
basis points onto the guidance that I've given you, 
but we did not include 
the 40 basis points in our guidance.
 
Kian Abouhossein

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
That's very detailed. The second question is regarding CVA. You mentioned 
you have another $800 million of 
--
 
first of all, the $2.9 bill
ion of collateral 
that you have to put up, can I put that in relation to the $225 million CVA 
charge and can I then use that to, very simplistically, say, okay, there's 
another $800 million that you've done on the third quarter, maybe that's 
even going up,
 
i.e., it's something like $13 million 
--
 
for every $13 million of 
collateral you're putting up roughly $1 million of CVA. Should we assume 
basically further CVA impact in the third quarter? And what I'm doing, is that 
correct, $225 million where there's $
2.9 billion?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, the most important point is that we're working to risk
-
mitigate any 
additional impact. And so I don't want to suggest there that you can do this 
straight
-
through extension. I think your proxy looking at the $225 million 
relati
ve to the $2.9 billion, I'll leave that to you. But it's not all a valuation 
allowance. As we said it's a valuational 
--
 
it's primarily a valuation 
allowance. There were some contract adjustments, so it's a bit less than 
what you've looked at there.
 
Kian A
bouhossein 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
And should you move to CCP some of the collateral? I assume you still have 
to put up CVA so far based on the proposal so far. So that shouldn't really 
help you. What I'm trying to understand is how 
could you mitigate this 
additional 
--
 
the additional charges?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, we're working through a number of different execution paths there.

Okay. Lastly, on FICC. I hate to come back to that q
uestion of the risk
-
weighted asset reductions. The way I understand is you want to reduce 
capital
-
intensive businesses. These are normally your strong business, i.e., if 
I look on the Basel III and 2.5, that's commodities and credits, which 
historically wa
s 
--
 
in FICC, have been your strong businesses. Can you talk a 
little bit about the revenue impact? And can you be maybe a little bit more 
specific also on the impact 
--
 
does it 
--
 
is it actually exiting certain business 
lines within these areas? Or is it 
maybe some geographical impact that we 
should be expecting from this?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We've highlighted in the past the areas that are heavy RWA and actually can 
be heavy funding requirements as well, but heavy RWA that aren't within 
that very tight strategic c
ircle that I talked about, that James talked about. 
And they would really include structured credit and sub
-
investment grade 
securitization so we're still 
--
 
we have 
--
 
we're still active in various parts of 
the mortgage market. But there are parts of it 
-
-
 
some investment grade 
where we can reduce what we're doing, structure credit the same. I would 
say that commodities and credit, as you've indicated, are strong business is 
credit, being one of our strongest and very central to that strategic circle I 
tal
ked about and similarly commodities has had strength over many years. 
So I'll point you back to prior comments consistently regarding the other 
areas.

The next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.

The first question I have relates to the drop in corporate lending 
commitments. I'm just curious as to 
--
 
if you can provide some color as to 
what's going on there. Does that imply a substantially lower risk appetite, or
 
was there a specific transaction that got done? Or could you provide some 
color on that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, we have continued lending. I think that what I'd point you to is our 
growth in HFI 
--
 
and I want to make sure you're looking at the entire 
picture, we 
have been increasing HFI balances. They're up meaningfully 
about 40% of our lending book now. I don't want to suggest that the rate of 
growth you've seen in the first half of the year is what you'll continue to see. 
We obviously moved to HFI. And I think t
hat's Page 8 in the supplement. If 
you look at the 2 pieces combined, you'll see that we continue to be active 
there. And as James said, we're very pleased with what we're able to 
continue to do with our partner, MUFG, and there's a real power to the 
combi
nation through our lending activities together.

I would just like to follow up on the higher value at risk in terms of the 
interest rate and credit spread numbers. Is there 
--
 
was that due
 
to volatility 
in the quarter, or was there something else going on there? Sorry for 
reiterating an earlier question, but...
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, that's fine. It's really just due to the mix of client activity and market 
volatility. But again, I'd point you to w
here it has run over the prior 3 years 
and it continues to be 
--
 
we continue to run it at lower levels.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.

I'm just trying to reconcile 
2 of your goals; one goal from, at least, last year, 
if not more recently, is to increase the market share in the Fixed Income 
trading business from 6% to 8% and reconcile that with the new target to 
reduce risk
-
weighted assets by 30% by the end of 2014. I
f those 2 goals 
collide, which one is more important?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, as I said, we're focused on share and capital efficiency and cost 
discipline, and we're continuing to drive share and share growth in areas 
that stay within that strategic circle. I kee
p coming back to that term for 
lack of a better one. But, for example, our rates business was up year
-
over
-
year. We've invested in it, it's a core part of the franchise. Corporate credit, 
as we have already talked about, is a key part of the business. So w
hen 
we're looking and defining the businesses that are RWA
-
heavy, and in fact, it 
very much goes to the opportunities that we see in other areas, then it's 
about increased balance sheet velocity, which Colm and Kenny and all of us 
have talked about for qui
te some time that we're driving in our flow 
business. And so returns are most important. We're not going for size for 
size's sake, but we see that in the areas in which we're competing, we have 
opportunity for additional share growth and that's what we're 
driving, again 
leveraging the strength across Institutional Securities.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA Asia

Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
So a little bit of an evolution, more toward returns as opposed to growth?
 
Ruth Porat
 
That's probably fair to say.
 
Michael M
ayo

CLSA Asia

Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
And then I'm looking at Page 5 of the supplement. And you have $22 billion 
of your Tier 1 capital allocated to Institutional Securities. That's a little bit 
over 1/2 of the total firm. And my 
question is when it comes to trading 
businesses or Fixed Income trading businesses, are you reducing risk
-
weighted assets enough? I mean you're penalized by the regulators, you're 
penalized by the rating agencies, you're probably penalized by investors to 
some degree. And a lot of these securities will be traded electronically, if 
everything goes to plan. So why not reduce the risk
-
weighted assets more 
dramatically?
 
Ruth Porat
 
And that is what we're doing. As I said, we have governance around driving 
risk
-
w
eighted assets down. We're going to continue to drive them down 
while, again, balancing what we believe drives the greatest returns for all of 
our stakeholders going back to A, what's the strategic lens; and B, what else 
can we be doing leveraging technolo
gy and other strengths in the business. 
But we are very, I think, consistent with what you're asking, driving RWAs 
down and have a governance process around that to deliver lower RWAs 
where we don't 
--
 
where we feel it's most appropriate.
 
James P. Gorman
 
A
nd I think, Mike, I mean what becomes dramatically if we're down 30% 
from the third quarter of '11 in risk
-
weighted assets by the end of '13, that's 
obviously a very significant shift. We've taken a lot of capital out of the 
merchant banking businesses and
 
we'll continue doing that consistent with 
the Volcker Rule. All the prop businesses that we've exited, few little stakes 
that we have in different pieces that have been floating around, the strategic 
investments made every 
--
 
part of the last decade or so
 
we've been slowly 
working our way out of, but we don't want to do it where we're taking 
unnecessarily damage 
--
 
unnecessarily damaging ourselves. So there is 
underneath this, if you aggregate the pieces, I would argue a pretty 
significant transformation. 
But we've also got to be mindful, as I think you 
pointed out earlier, we're balancing obviously revenues in some very strong 
businesses within Fixed Income and sales and trading with exiting on a 
prudent, sort of not patient, an aggressive timetable, but n
ot a reckless 
timetable.

And then last follow
-
up. So if Institutional Securities takes up 1/2 of your 
capital today, where do you think that might be 3 to 5 years from now, a 
fourth, a third?
 
Jame
s P. Gorman
 
I don't know you whether we want to wing that.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA Asia
-
Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
But less?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Yes, obviously. The capital makes it look whole corporation's coming down. 
We hold a lot of capital at the pare
nt level where, as Ruth pointed out under 
Basel III, we're, I guess, a tad below or somewhere below 8.5. We feel like 
on any comparative measure 
--
 
I mean it's one thing to have to go and raise 
capital and maybe have high returns in the short run versus ha
ving low 
returns and having the capital already in
-
house, and that's the position we're 
in. And over time, as we restructure, bring down the risk
-
weighted assets, 
obviously we'll get much more active on the capital management side, which 
is what something 
I know all shareholders, including us, are looking forward 
to doing.

The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.
 
Michael Carrier

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
First on the MSSB business. If the integration costs ar
e going to start coming 
down in the next couple of quarters, does anything change on your margin 
outlook? And I guess, more importantly, you mentioned a lot of other things 
kind of outside the U.S. that you're working on, I mean using the U.S. as 
generatin
g more efficiencies. So does anything change if we're still in this 
rate environment? Or do you still need rates and market as a tailwind to get 
to that longer
-
term 20%?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the mid
-
teens margin by mid
-
next year is the 
--
 
we're still on track for
 
that and that was predicated upon the integration being done and 
integration
-
related expenses coming off, so there's no news in that. The 
discussion we have 
--
 
are having regarding what we're doing with our 
International Wealth Management businesses are m
odestly additive to that 
mid
-
teens by mid
-
next year target. And as we look at the longer
-
term 
higher target it's still predicated on a lift from rates or equity markets. As 
we've talked about 50 basis points in said funds is 1 point on PBT margin, 
and at s
ome point, rates will revert to the mean. So that is still additive. But 
that is how we build it up over time. Still very much on track and the 
International Wealth Management is modestly additive.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
And 
then on the expenses. As part of that reengineering effort, the $1.4 
billion, does that take into consideration everything that you're talking about 
on the fixed side in terms of reducing the risk
-
weighted assets, reducing the 
cost or would that be increme
ntal? And then on top of that, just given the 
environment and given that $1.4 billion kind of target through 2014, has 
anything changed to force that up or anything more material?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the Office of Re
-
engineering was set up quite some time ago to
 
look at 
reengineering bigger parts of the business like what are we doing with 
technology structure and outsourcing or legal entity consolidation, things like 
that. We're very much on track for the $500 million run rate excess from 
this year and $1.4 bill
ion that we talked about. What we've discussed today 
and the benefit of this incremental drive on non
-
comp expense is additive to 
the Office of Re
-
engineering. So I think a simple way to think about it is 
there's the Office of Re
-
engineering. There are the
 
ongoing tactical expense 
initiatives that we've talked about and this adds 
--
 
the added drive on non
-
comp, comp
-
related items adds to our savings. And to be clear, in the Office 
of Re
-
engineering there is a component that's compensation and non
-
compensati
on related because we're fundamentally reengineering certain 
parts of the business. But the items that James went through this morning 
are additive.
 
James P. Gorman
 
And I think that, to be fair, the bar for incremental expenses for things that 
are not obvi
ously investments driving really visible revenues is extremely 
high. We're 
--
 
like everybody else in the banking industry at the moment, 
there are a limited number of things you can control about the external 
environment. So we're controlling what we spend
 
very carefully, and we'll 
continue to so.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Okay. And then last question, 2 items that are typically unforecastable. But 
the other sales and trading just x the adjustment this quarter expect to go 
back t
o that run rate loss? And then on the tax rate, same thing, a bit lower? 
A lot of moving pieces this quarter but expect it to go back to more 
--
 
a 
normal level?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, as you said, the other sales and trading is hard to forecast because 
there are a lot of different items in that line item. With respect of the tax 
rate, I can hopefully give you a little more guidance although the tax rate's 
obviously a function of geographic mix. But we would guide to still 
approximately 30% in the third q
uarter. But as I said it's a function of 
geographic mix and the second quarter was affected by the estimate of full 
year DVA, so that moves around as well. But best estimate at this point, for 
what it's worth, is 30%.

The final question will come 
from Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.
 
Douglas Sipkin

Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research 
Division
 
Just wanted to focus in a little bit more on the Global Wealth business. Looks 
like it's a little bit trickier quarter for some of the metrics. The 
brokerage 
headcount, and I guess, the percentage of assets with 
--
 
the percentage of 
brokers with wealthy clients. How much of this is sort of related to sort of 
this sort of being the final integration? Or I mean is there something else 
that maybe you guy
s can address, or was it really just sort of the all the 
uncertainty around the ratings and things like that? If you could address 
that, that'd be helpful.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you. So we've talked over the last several quarters about focusing on 
the quality r
ather than the quantity of financial advisors. And the number is 
down this quarter, but again consistent with that strategic prioritization. 
Where we really focus is what's the retention of our top performers and the 
attrition in our top 2 quintiles is con
sistent with prior quarters, which we 
view as a positive, very much to your question about the impact of platform 
integration. Given the low attrition while going through platform integration 
we do view that as a real positive because human nature is peopl
e don't like 
change. The way the team is managing it is to do what they can to increase 
the productivity of financial advisors, and I think one very good example is 
the way they restructured the training programs. So we have reduced the 
number of trainees,
 
incoming trainees, from 2,000 down to 1,250. And the 
view is that, that does quite a number of things for us. One, it raises the bar 
on the group that we bring into train. It allows us to do a much deeper job 
training them. We attach them to mentors and b
ranches. And overall, we've 
seen a 30% increase in the success rate. So reduce the incoming number of 
people, not only is that helpful overall for the incoming people but 
--
 
and 
their productivity, but also non
-
compensation expenses benefit because we 
have
 
fewer people coming in. But this is just an example of the types of 
things we're doing to focus on productivity and quality rather than the 
number. And in terms of the AUM for the $1 million
-
plus that you noted, 
what we see is kind of more seasonal patter
n that anything. It's drifted down 
in the last several years in the second quarter as well.
 
Douglas Sipkin 
-
 
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research 
Division
 
Okay, great. And then could you guys provide any more specifics about 
guidance around integrat
ion charges for the remainder of the year? I know 
you guys mentioned it'd be coming down, but could you put any hard 
numbers do that in either Q3 or Q4 or just for the second half?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, historically they were running in the $80 million to $100 
million area. It 
was $80 million in the second quarter. It does decline 
--
 
I'm not going to do 
a flag quantifying what that will be in the third or fourth quarter. But it 
comes down through the next several quarters for the obvious reason, done 
with integr
ation. But we are running a number of things in parallel. So for 
example, data retention, we're continuing to keep people employed to 
ensure we're doing the right things with respect to data quality. We're also 
continuing training in the field. And we also
 
have software capitalization 
kicking in. So we've got a number of additional items that's somewhat down.
 
James P. Gorman
 
I think just to add to that, that the mix, as Ruth said, is changing from 
building the technology to training the people to use it to 
capitalizing the 
software that it's based upon. So that's sort of a mix change. And I think the 
third quarter, obviously with the transaction we'll be doing with Citibank, will 
be a little messier as we get through that, but the outlook is clearly the mix 
change and the volume change.

James P. Gorman
 
Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Celeste. Our results and actions 
this quarter evidence 
progress and important milestones towards our long
-
term strategic plan, a plan we laid out for all of you several years ago. In 
addition to executing on the long
-
term strategy, we also remain nimble and 
have demonstrated our ability to adjust tactically.
 
A
 
key to our future is increased contribution of Wealth Management to our 
revenue, profitability, returns and funding stability. This quarter, we 
continued to move forward in 2 ways. First, on the tactical front. Our margin 
progress, at 13% pretax margin ex
cluding nonrecurring expenses, provides 
increasing support of the strategy. Second, and of greater long
-
term 
significance, we purchased 14% of the Wealth Management joint venture, 
while locking in the price and greater flexibility for the remaining 35%. We
're 
pleased to have clarity about our future and are closer to recognizing the full 
value of Global Wealth Management for the firm and for our shareholders, 
value that goes beyond the short
-
term margin targets.
 
In addition, the revenue and profit contribut
ion of MSIM, our Asset 
Management business, really rounds out the wealth and asset management 
side of the firm. Also key to our future obviously is our long
-
term strategy in 
ISG, which continues to reinforce an integrated business that best delivers 
for cl
ients, leverages our historic strengths, while optimizing capital. Again, 
on the tactical front, our objective this quarter was to demonstrate a 
recovery from the challenging second quarter, though acknowledging 
seasonality. This was most clear in our Fixe
d Income results, which 
rebounded sharply even with the continued drag from CVA due to the 
tightening of our credit spreads. As discussed on our last earnings call, 
clients did reengage with us at the end of the second quarter and continued 
to do so throug
hout the third quarter.
 
Evidence of progress across the firm towards our long
-
term strategy is our 
strong Basel III capital ratio, which is now north of 9% as of September 30. 
We've accomplished a lot over the last several years to position this firm well 
for the future and the new regulatory landscape. We have great confidence 
we'll translate this value into greater profitability for our shareholders and 
drive returns higher through sensible capital actions at the appropriate time.
 
Now I'm going to turn it
 
over to Ruth to take you through our earnings in 
detail. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the 
effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile t
hese non
-
GAAP measures.
 
DVA in the quarter was a loss of $2.3 billion with $1.6 billion in Fixed Income 
sales and trading and $641 million in Equity sales and trading. Excluding the 
impact of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues were $7.6 billion, up 14% sequentially. 
Noninterest expense was $6.8 billion, up 13% versus the second quarter. 
Compensation expense was $3.9 billion this quarter. Noncompensation 
expense was $2.8 billion, up 19% from last quarter, reflecting nonrecurring 
expenses associated with the Global Weal
th Management integration, as well 
as higher litigation costs. The effective tax rate from continuing operations 
for the third quarter was 35.4%.
 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders were approximately $535 m
illion. Earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share were $0.28 after preferred dividends. On a 
reported or GAAP basis, firm
-
wide revenues for the quarter were $5.3 billion. 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
s
hareholders were a loss of $1 billion. Reported earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share were a loss of $0.55 after preferred dividends. 
Book value at the end of the quarter was $30.53 per share. Tangible book 
value was $26.65 per share, refle
cting a reduction of $0.58 related to the 
increased 14% ownership stake in the Wealth Management joint venture.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total assets were $765 billion at 
September 30, up from $749 billion last quarter. Our liquidity reserve was 
$
170 billion at the end of the quarter versus $173 billion last quarter. 
Deposits were $71 billion, up again this quarter. Although our calculations 
are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be 
approximately 13.7% and our Tie
r 1 capital ratio will be approximately 
16.7%. Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be 
approximately $319 billion at September 30. Subject to final rule
-
making, 
our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was north of 9% as of the end of 
the thir
d quarter, assuming full Basel III inflation of risk
-
weighted assets and 
0 benefit from future mitigation.
 
Let me now discuss our business in detail. In Institutional Securities, 
revenues, excluding DVA, were $3.6 billion, up 26% sequentially. 
Noninterest 
expense was $3.3 billion, up 21% versus the second quarter. 
Compensation was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, reflecting a 45% ratio, 
excluding DVA. Noncompensation expense increased 27% from last quarter 
due to higher litigation costs of approximately 
$280 million. The business 
reported a pretax profit of $345 million, excluding the impact of DVA. 
Including the impact of DVA, the business reported a pretax loss of $1.9 
billion.
 
In Investment Banking, revenues of $969 million were up 10% versus last 
quar
ter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in global 
IPOs, #2 in global announced M&A, #3 in global equity and #4 in U.S. dollar 
investment
-
grade debt at the end of the third quarter. Notable transactions 
included, in equity underwriting, 
the $8.5 billion global IPO of Japan Airlines, 
which marked the second
-
largest IPO globally this year and the largest 
airline float in history. This transaction is also a great example of the power 
of our partnership with MUFG. In advisory, Porsche SE tran
sferred the 
remaining 50.1% stake in Porsche AG to Volkswagen valued at $8.9 billion. 
And in debt underwriting, Blackstone's $650 million offering, its first
-
ever 
30
-
year bond issuance and its largest debt offering to date.
 
Advisory revenues of $339 millio
n were up 29% versus the second quarter, 
with increased revenues in all regions. Equity underwriting revenues were 
$199 million, a 30% decrease from the second quarter. Although equity 
underwriting volumes for the industry were up sequentially, they were m
ore 
heavily weighted toward follow
-
on offerings and block deals versus IPOs in 
the second quarter.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $431 million were up 28% versus 
last quarter, reflecting increased revenue in high yield and investment
-
grade 
issuance,
 
as well as stronger loan syndication fees. Equity sales and trading 
revenue, excluding DVA, were $1.2 billion, an increase of 7% from last 
quarter. Derivatives revenues improved despite seasonality due to a 
combination of more favorable market conditions 
and expansion of our client 
footprint.
 
Prime brokerage revenues increased modestly despite reduced average 
hedge fund leverage in the quarter. Hedge fund leverage picked up at the 
end of the quarter and continues to increase. Revenues in cash equities were
 
consistent with last quarter despite significantly reduced levels of market 
activity globally. Results were supported by share gains across most 
markets.
 
Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, 
were $1.5 billion. Revenues w
ere up 89% versus our second quarter results. 
Revenues increased across most of our businesses. CVA, net of hedges, was 
negative again this quarter due to the tightening of our credit spreads. Year
-
to
-
date in rates, we have generated almost as much revenue
 
as we did in 
the entirety of 2011. In foreign exchange, we delivered our best reported 
quarter since 2009. Within our credit businesses, we had particular strength 
in our Securitized Products business. Commodities results benefited from 
more favorable mar
ket conditions. Other sales and trading reflects negative 
revenues of $164 million compared with negative $11 million last quarter.
 
Turning to VAR. We implemented a new VAR model this quarter, which we 
have been running in parallel since 2011. Our new VAR 
model has been 
approved by regulators. The benefit of the new model is that it is more 
responsive to current market conditions, while also maintaining longer
-
term 
perspective. The new model is aligned with Basel 2.5 requirements. In our 
supplement, we prov
ided VAR measures under both our current and 
previous VAR model for this quarter, the prior quarter and the prior year, 
and we will do the same for the fourth quarter. Our average trading VAR for 
the third quarter was $63 million versus $76 million in the 
second quarter 
and $99 million in the prior year.
 
Turning to Global Wealth Management. Revenues of $3.3 billion were flat to 
the prior quarter. Asset Management revenues were down modestly versus 
the prior quarter, reflecting lower market levels at June 30
. Transaction 
revenues increased 6% from last quarter, consisting primarily of 
commissions of $521 million, which decreased 2% from last quarter, 
reflecting lower equity volume. Investment Banking
-
related fees of $199 
million, which decreased 11% versus la
st quarter, driven by a slower equity 
issuance calendar and trading revenues of $312 million, which were up 41% 
versus the second quarter, reflecting strong fixed income secondary trading, 
as well as markups in our deferred compensation plans.
 
Noninterest 
expense was $3.1 billion, up 6% from last quarter. Expenses 
included nonrecurring items of approximately $193 million related to the 
integration and the purchase of the 14% stake in the joint venture. The 
compensation ratio was 61% versus 60% in the second
 
quarter. 
Noncompensation expense was $1 billion, up 14% versus last quarter. 
Excluding the nonrecurring expenses associated with the joint venture, the 
PBT margin was 13%. On a reported basis, the PBT margin was 7%, with 
profit before tax of $239 million.
 
Total client assets increased to $1.8 trillion, reflecting the benefit of higher 
equity markets and positive flows. Global fee
-
based asset inflows were $8 
billion, fee
-
based assets under management increased to $556 billion at 
quarter end. Global represen
tatives were 16,829. Bank deposits were $118 
billion, with approximately $60 billion held in Morgan Stanley banks.
 
Asset Management revenues of $631 million were up from $456 million in 
the second quarter, due primarily to principal investment gains in Mer
chant 
Banking and Real Estate. In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of 
$372 million were up 10% compared to the second quarter due to higher 
market levels. In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $125 million were flat 
versus last quarter. Due to the ow
nership structure of these funds, the 
majority of these revenues are passed to third
-
party investors in the 
noncontrolling interest line.
 
In Merchant Banking, revenues were $134 million compared with negative 
$3 million in the second quarter driven primari
ly by principal investment 
gains. Compensation expense was $241 million in the quarter, up slightly 
from $214 million in the second quarter. Profit before tax was $198 million, 
up from $43 million last quarter. NCI was $50 million versus $23 million last 
q
uarter. Total assets under management increased to $331 billion driven by 
net inflows of $11 billion and market appreciation.
 
Turning to our outlook. We continue to see momentum in our businesses 
based on better market conditions and the strategic position
ing of the firm. 
With respect to the market, both institutional and retail investor activity 
picked up on the back of the ECB's bold moves in August. We believe the 
ECB's actions reduced the probability of a tail risk event in Europe, although 
challenges r
emain in Europe and globally.
 
With respect to the firm's businesses, clients clearly reengaged with us post 
the ratings decision in late June and continued to do so throughout the third 
quarter. We saw a recovery in our Fixed Income results and continue to
 
benefit from our cohesive sales and trading businesses. Investment Banking 
volumes industry
-
wide remain muted relative to historic levels, but pipelines 
are healthy. With our strong market share, we are well positioned if the 
fledgling economic recovery i
n the U.S. persists and market stability in 
Europe is sustained. We are increasingly benefiting from our Wealth 
Management business, including the advantages of being on one platform as 
well as our increased stake in the business. We are also yielding resu
lts from 
our alliance with MUFG with powerful market share gains in Japanese and 
cross
-
border M&A.
 
We continue to take the steps needed to realize cost savings through 
headcount reductions and cost
-
cutting, setting us up well for 2013 and 
2014. Specificall
y, by the end of the third quarter, we were close to our 
headcount reduction goal for all of 2012. Our Office of Re
-
engineering 
remains on track to achieve $500 million run rate savings this year and $1.4 
billion by 2014. And the results of our cost initia
tives in GWM are 
increasingly visible now that we are on one platform.
 
Looking forward, we remain confident about our path to ROE expansion 
based on the revenue, profitability and capital strategies we have 
implemented. Most notably, in 
Institutional Securities, we have leading 
global businesses with momentum across the platform enhanced by capital 
optimization. In Wealth Management, we are already benefiting from our 
increased ownership both because we are earning a return on the capital
 
held against the 14% and the growing deposit base, which will drive funding 
efficiency and revenue expansion. Because of these and other steps we have 
taken, as well as the early signs of an improving macro environment, we 
look forward to the future.
 
Than
k you for listening. And James and I will now take your questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Howard Chen with 
Crédit Suisse.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
You both men
tioned the impact of the CVA this quarter. Can you tell us how 
meaningful that was? And were there any hedges against that as I think is 
your historical practice?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So there were hedges against it as is our historical practice and as we 
disclosed 
in our filings. And the drag 
--
 
just to try and help you size it, the 
drag from CVA this quarter was bigger than the period
-
specific items we 
called out last quarter in our Fixed Income business. In addition, we had a 
drag in equities, although it was smal
ler than in Fixed Income.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Great. And then, James, could you just update us on your long
-
term 
strategy vision for the Commodities business and how you see both the 
physical and the nonphysical segments of th
e business fitting within the 
regulatory framework as we go forward?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Well, Commodities has been a great business here at Morgan Stanley for a 
long time. It continues to be an attractive business. Obviously, with the 
Dodd
-
Frank legislation, 
there are potential limits to some of the activities 
that we can pursue in that business. So it's incumbent upon us to explore all 
forms of different structures, appropriate structures, that can take us 
forward, where we can get the benefits of the busines
s but also meet the 
regulatory constraints that we operate under.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay. And then on capital management, James, you've highlighted in the 
past to think about this capital management and capital trends as seq
uential 
process. So sequentially, you've retired legacy issues, you've bought the 
first 15% of the buy
-
in, crystallized the price for the rest and this Basel III 
Tier 1 common continues to improve. So where we are now, how do you 
think about the potential 
ability to buy back your stock, restore the dividend 
and/or maybe do the rest of the buy
-
in?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Well, it's a good question, Howard. Obviously, we have CCAR process that 
we and the other financial institutions go through with our regulators, bo
th 
Federal Reserve and the other regulators. And in that process, one is in a 
position to pursue a range of capital actions. The process is now conducted 
twice yearly. Last couple of years, it's been once yearly. So there are 
opportunities going forward to
 
put in place whatever plans we have in place. 
We've made it pretty clear that our major strategic objective is to complete 
the acquisition of MSSB, of which we have remaining 35%. And that would 
have a very modest capital implication for us, given the agr
eed
-
upon price 
and the goodwill we already hold against the position. So I don't want to get 
ahead of ourselves and don't want to get ahead of our regulators. We'll 
address what and when other actions as we get to the CCAR process in 
January of next year.
 
Howard Chen 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Great. That makes sense. And just finally for me, you noted the heightened 
litigation costs this quarter. What specifically did those relate to, Ruth? And 
how far would you say we are through crisis and pos
tcrisis litigation for the 
firm?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, it covered 
--
 
this quarter covered a number of items, including the 
recent decision in one matter but also expenses associated with other 
ongoing matters. And I think, as you put it, litigation has been an 
ongoing 
cost for the industry. And I think it will continue to be.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Just going back to, I think, probably a couple of things Howard
 
asked. 
Besides sort of the CCAR process, are there other things with respect to 
buying in the rest of the JV that factor into your decision
-
making? And what 
would cause you to accelerate that or not, separate from the capital 
allocation?
 
James P. Gorman
 
W
ell, I'll have a go, then Ruth can jump in. We agreed on a fixed price on 
the JV. And given that fixed price, the capital 
--
 
and you can do the math on 
it 
--
 
the capital implications of buying the rest of it are pretty modest. There 
are many advantages to 
pursuing that, obviously, but again we've got to go 
through the CCAR process and make sure it's the right time to do it. But 
there are advantages to pursue it and we've made that very clear. This is a 
strategic imperative.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capit
al, Research Division
 
Got it. Okay. And then just maybe tied to that broadly, you've got to a 13% 
pretax margin, excluding the charges. Your target next year is mid
-
teens. 
Can you just remind us what other milestones we'd be looking for? I mean, 
you're obviously close to that number now. Does this continue to, as you 
model it out, rise over the course of next year, so you're at a higher level, 
above mid
-
teens by the end of next year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we're still guiding to mid
-
teens margin mid
-
next y
ear, but 2 components 
I think to your question. First is we're looking forward to the fourth quarter 
and beyond a couple of items. One, integration expense is running lower 
post the second quarter. As we've talked about it, ran kind of the $80 million 
to $
100 million per quarter area in the first half, and then we had budgeted 
for it to come down in the third and fourth quarters, which it did, running at 
lower levels, and then dropped off again next year. So the third quarter 
margin did benefit from that dr
op in integration expense, which will also 
benefit the fourth quarter, and then it goes down in 2013. The second thing 
is that we'll have a full quarter of the expense benefit associated with the 
charge that we took in the third quarter. We had 2 of 3 mont
hs' benefit in 
the third quarter. So there was some impact on the 13% margin this 
quarter. We get the full 3 months' benefit next quarter. Obviously, we are 
always careful to say that PBT margin expansion is not a straight line. For 
example, in the fourth 
quarter, we do tend to have seasonally higher 
expenses. But it's too soon to tell. And then I think as we look forward, and 
really building on James' comment about the upside, whenever it comes with 
the additional 35%, when we buy that in, first and foremo
st, we generate 
earnings on this capital that we're already holding against Citi's stakes. So 
that meaningfully improves ROE in the business. But in addition to that, we 
get the benefit from adding about another $55 billion in deposits over time. 
So not on
ly do we benefit from efficient stable funding, but we also increase 
net interest income, which is higher
-
margin. And then beyond NCI, there's 
an earnings benefit from trading volumes that are now directed to Citi based 
on an order flow agreement. That's e
liminated when we own 100%. So some 
contractual benefits that take it higher, and then there are certain other 
costs from managing a joint venture that drop away. So mid
-
teens margin 
mid
-
next year is the guidance, but I just wanted to give you the path 
for
ward.
 
Roger A. Freeman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, on the Basel III Tier 1 ratio, 9%. The last 
quarter, I think you said you were just under 8.5%. There was some benefit 
from the MSSB transaction. But also is t
he 8.5% still a comparable number? 
Because I know the NPR had just come out in June. And so I don't know if 
there were any revisions to the historical look
-
back.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. That's a comparable number. The increase really starts with earnings, 
and as y
ou know well, DVA is not relevant for the capital calculation. So 
starting with earnings, there was a modest benefit from the new VAR model. 
But I think, very important, we continue to execute on our RWA plan, the 
risk
-
weighted asset plan.
 
Operator
 
Your ne
xt question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc., Research 
Division
 
Can you update us on your FICC risk
-
weighted asset reduction? How much 
have you done
? And how much more do you have to go?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Mike, given we just laid it out at a conference recently, what I'll say is we're 
very much on track for the targets that we laid out at the conference.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc., Research 
Division
 
Okay. The increase in your Basel III Tier 1 ratio, was that helped out this 
quarter by the risk
-
weighted asset reduction? Or is that to come? And also 
did the VAR change help out your ca
pital ratio?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. The 3 components that helped the capital ratio was obviously starting 
with earnings, and then I just mentioned that there was a modest benefit 
from the new VAR model. And yes, we did continue to execute on the RWA 
plan, that wa
s part of the benefit.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc., Research 
Division
 
And why did you make the change in the VAR model? Was it simply to get a 
shorter time series? And if so, what
 
time frame did you have before versus 
now?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. The primary driver was to have a VAR model that's more sensitive to 
changes in market volatility. So it is more weighted to 1 year data. As we've 
talked about in the past, our prior VAR model was 
really 
--
 
it was based on 
4
-
year data. And we've been running this model and the prior model in 
parallel since 2011, which gives us a high level of comfort from the model. 
It's been approved by regulators. It is consistent with Basel requirements. 
And in o
ur disclosure, what you've probably seen is we've provided the VAR 
measures under both models for this quarter, the prior quarter, the prior 
year. And we will be doing the same for the fourth quarter. I thought it 
would be helpful for you to be able to see
 
the trends under both models, 
which are the same, VAR was down this quarter.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc., Research 
Division
 
And you can appreciate the idea of changing a VAR mode
l gets people's 
attention these days. Is there anything else you've looked out at, given 
what's taken place recently elsewhere in putting in place a new VAR model? 
I mean, you've put it in place firm
-
wide, you've ran it in parallel for, what, 
1.5 years. An
ything else you can say to assure people?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. So first and foremost, it's part of the overall governance around risk 
management where you have one centralized risk organization. It reports to 
the board risk committee. The risk organization bui
lt the model. It's been 
thoroughly vetted internally and, as I said, approved by regulators. We've 
been running both models in parallel for an extended period of time. And the 
other point is that VAR is just one of multiple measures of risk we use to 
asses
s overall risk in the organization. So we've talked in the past about our 
proprietary stress VAR model. That captures a longer time series and market 
liquidity and tail risk. And we do constant scenario modeling with stresses 
for volatility and price chang
es. So it's part of an overall to your point, very 
good question, overall comprehensive risk management, centralized risk 
management organization with multiple tools.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc., Research 
Division
 
And then last question. In Wealth Management, now that you're on one 
platform, I imagine you had many people working on that integration. You 
said you're at your headcount reduction already. So how many people were 
working on that integration? And I guess, they'll be redeployed for more 
external activities or elsewhere. What kind of additional synergies can you 
get now that the integration is finally done?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as I indicated, the expenses were higher in 
the first half but didn't drop 
off completely in the third and fourth quarter because we've continued to 
provide support. We had built that into our upfront plan. So you're right. I 
don't have the numbers with me, but headcount does benefit modestly as 
we 
completed the platform and will continue to benefit.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
A quickie on loan. Loan commitments have been coming down. They're 
actuall
y down like in half. Is that a function of the environment or a little 
more a function of the Basel III Dodd
-
Frank world that we're going to live 
in?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So loans 
--
 
what I'd like to point you to is obviously the difference between 
what's in our fai
r value block versus HFI. As we've talked about several 
quarters ago, we were increasingly moving to HFI. That is up again this 
quarter. And overall, our loan book is actually up this quarter. So I think the 
change is in what's fair value versus HFI, HFI i
s now over half of our total 
loan book.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
A totally fair point. I guess, M&A performance is pretty good. But in general, 
industry
-
wide, you scratch your head, you look back and you say, ""Well, 
cond
itions actually should be pretty good for a heated M&A environment,"" 
yet I think there's a lot of conversations, good pipelines and not a lot of 
trigger
-
pulling. I'm just not sure if you can think through the things that 
would maybe break up that log jam a
nd what your expectations are next 4 
or 5 quarters.
 
Ruth Porat
 
You're absolutely right. Our view is that the conditions that we're seeing 
today with lower volatility in the markets and low rates, so an attractive 
financing environment, if you look historic
ally, that should set up for a 
--
 
or 
encourage a pretty robust M&A environment, pretty 
--
 
higher levels of 
activity. And very much to your point, industry
-
wide volumes continue to 
remain at very low levels. What we're hearing anecdotally is that much of 
th
at continues to be the uncertainty about the environment. Some concern, 
not just in Europe, but increasingly here in the U.S. and that, that is 
basically putting activity kind of on the sidelines. Conversation's ongoing and 
the pipeline's healthy, but very
 
much to your point, need to have more 
clarity about the environment and some of the changes that are 
forthcoming, in particular, here in the U.S. for activity to move forward in a 
meaningful way is our expectation.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd
., Research Division
 
Excellent. And last one, just more of a big picture one, I think everything 
you pointed out at the beginning of the call is spot
-
on. I think Fixed Income 
snapped back strong. M&A, debt underwriting, Equity is all good, Wealth 
Managemen
t getting better, we're going to own more. Even if you do the 
math of you owning more and hitting your margin target, I'm still coming up 
in a single
-
digit ROE range. And I just don't know if it's just waiting on a 
better environment. I'm just curious if y
ou, in your minds, have a path 
towards, say, a double
-
digit ROE and what it takes to get there.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. We do have meaningful ROE upside and are unequivocally focused on 
driving returns in each of our businesses. There was noise in the numbers 
thi
s quarter. I'll let you model those in. But taking you to the sustainably 
higher ROE and focusing on those drivers we've talked about, revenue 
profitability, capital efficiency for the various businesses 
--
 
let me go into 
them in some detail. So in Wealth 
Management, in terms of the revenue 
upside, we're continuing to increase our managed accounts business. It's up 
above $550 billion this quarter, it's up 20% year
-
over
-
year. And that's 
accretive to returns. And we are increasing our lending business. We hav
e 
$73 billion of deposits as of October 15 once the deposits came in from Citi 
associated with the 14% stake. Those come in under the drag basis 
--
 
lag 
basis, rather. So $73 billion of deposits, we're increasingly moving that to 
higher
-
margin products, whi
ch will increase NIM, even without any rate 
increase. And then on the expense side, you've seen it in the third quarter. 
The integration is complete, so expenses have come down and have more 
room to go, as I just noted. And the cost savings programs add to
 
that even 
more. And then on the capital side, as you said, when we own 
--
 
as we 
increasingly own more of the joint venture, we generate earnings on what I 
have repeatedly called deadweight capital. We're holding this capital against 
Citi's stake and not e
arning 
--
 
generating earnings on it. Notably, as we buy
-
in the remainder of the Wealth Management joint venture, there is 
contractually significant revenue and profitability upsides that I commented 
on, things like the order flow agreement, a limit, more d
eposits 
--
 
so more 
upside beyond that contractually. And then on the Institutional Securities 
side, starting with revenues, we have sizable operating leverage in our 
institutional businesses, and we're executing on our plan. So we have a 
stellar platform i
n banking, we have a strong M&A pipeline. The same is true 
for equity new issuance, and both really played to our strengths. We have a 
leading franchise in institutional equities, and we continue to increase share 
even with low volumes, low market
-
wide vol
umes. And on Fixed Income, 
we're on track to running an optimized returns business with a strong client 
franchise, putting risk behind clients with smart capital efficiency. And we're 
pleased with the momentum in the business. On expenses, we now have 
very
 
strong expense controls, comp and noncomp. And on capital, we're 
benefiting from more efficient use of capital across the businesses. On top of 
that, there would be upside from any return of capital and from an 
improving market over time. But we're buildi
ng to a healthy increase in ROE 
with the revenue profitability and capital levers I've just gone through.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Hey, Glenn, it's James. You said at the beginning what an overall big picture 
on the ROE, and as Ruth just laid out all the components
. But just step back 
for a minute. The first quarter, the ROE was 9%. Second quarter, obviously, 
we fell into a hole with the rating agency action, and there is 
--
 
clearly, we 
wanted to demonstrate that we've bounced back from that, which I think we 
have c
lear demonstration. You put all the pieces together, and it's not a 
terribly heroic assumption to get back to your cost of capital. And that's 
clearly what our plan and focus is on. We will be very, very, very focused on 
noncomp expenses. We are very atten
tive to our overall capital plan over 
the next couple of years. We're determined to make this GWM acquisition 
work. And as Ruth said, we have huge operating leverage across 
Institutional Securities. So again, I'm not sure what your math is looking 
like, bu
t I don't think it takes a lot of heroic assumptions to get you to a 
reasonable ROE number. And then obviously from then on, as the global 
macro environment improves, which I believe it is on the starting basis of 
doing, we take it up from that point.

The next question will come from Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.
 
Kian Abouhossein 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
First question is relating to risk
-
weighted assets again. You mentioned at a 
recent conference, second quarter group risk
-
weigh
ted assets were about 
$500 billion. Could you give us an update where we stand as of the third 
quarter with a 9% Tier 1 Basel III?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Given we just went through it at a recent conference, we're continuing to 
execute on the RWA plan. But I don't hav
e it with me because we're not 
updating it at this point.
 
Kian Abouhossein 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
When will you give actually more details on your Basel III? Because it's been 
industry standard to start give a little bit more details. Wh
en should we 
expect you actually to either have it in the press release or in any other form 
that you give more details on capital as well as Basel III details?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, actually, I think that with the delineation we gave, and in particular in 
Fixe
d Income, we've given quite a bit of granularity because we wanted to 
make it clear how we're thinking about this strategically. And we've laid out 
some pretty key milestones. I think it might be helpful if I roll forward based 
on that plan where that gets
 
you in '13. And you've probably already done 
this. But based on our current interpretation of the rules, consensus 
earnings and the RWA reduction plan that we did lay out at the conference, 
the math will get you to north of 10% by 2013.
 
Kian Abouhossein

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Okay. Moving on to funding cost. Your funding cost is about 50 to 100 basis 
points higher than your peers. And I'm looking at your balance sheet, and 
you have about $170 billion of long
-
term debt. But I'm sure 
there's other 
long
-
term debt that I'm missing because of the way it's categorized. How 
much long
-
term debt do you actually have or what you categorize as long
-
term debt in your business? And how does a 50 to 100 basis points higher 
CDS spread impact your f
unding cost really going forward? How should we 
think about how you fund your business and the impact on the ROE?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So you've identified the long
-
term debt. You've got the right number there. 
In terms of funding, as I've said on many quarterly cal
ls, the strategic 
moves that we've been making are benefiting our funding costs and our 
requirements. So for example, the growth of the deposit base, which is fairly 
consistent with our ongoing growth of the Wealth Management business 
funds both our corpor
ate and retail loan books and additional products in the 
bank. And as we increase funding with deposits, we reduce reliance on our 
unsecured funding. With respect to the business mix, as we move more 
toward flow, which we've talked about quarter
-
after
-
quar
ter from structured 
products, we're funding more efficiently through the secured channel. And as 
a result of this and all that we've been doing with the balance sheet, this 
quarter alone, our unsecured debt is down by $3 billion. In 2012 year
-
to
-
date, it's
 
down by about $20 billion. So in the aggregate, as a result of the 
strategic move, which is why I keep anchoring it back to that, the strategy is 
actually yielding multiple benefits. We've reduced our funding requirements, 
we've increased the durability o
f our funding because we have more 
efficiency given the multiple funding sources.
 
Kian Abouhossein 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Okay. That's actually quite useful. And in terms of the comp ratio, I get to 
an IB
-
clean comp of 45% in the quarter
. You mentioned noncomp as an 
improvement area. Most banks that I talk to are looking at more like high 
30s as a comp target over the medium
-
term. How do you see your long
-
term comp ratio outlook, assuming no material changes in revenues?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Unders
tood. So in recent quarters with higher revenues, we've delivered a 
lower compensation ratio, which evidences our philosophy and continues to 
drive returns. And as we've said many times, we're focused on appropriately 
rewarding those who drive returns whil
e improving ROE and earnings. So it's 
not just about compensation dollars. We're also looking at headcount 
management, at location sourcing, at the overall expense management 
program and looking at both comp and noncomp.
 
Kian Abouhossein 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase 
& Co, Research Division
 
But with this revenue environment, is it fair to say we should still see low 
40s as a number on comp? Is it reasonable?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, I was going to make 2 points. The other important point to note is 
obviously ratios are not app
les
-
to
-
apples across the Street. And as I said, 
we're looking at ensuring that we get the balance right so that we can 
reward those who drive returns while improving ROE.
 
Kian Abouhossein

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Okay. And last question on
 
your VAR model. Do you still use a Monte Carlo 
model or historic now?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Historic.

The next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
 
Matthew H. Burnell 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
 
I have a fol
low
-
up question, I guess, to Glenn's question about the 
businesses and getting to ROE, Ruth. And maybe you incorporated your 
comments on this, but you didn't really focus on the Asset Management 
businesses. You're currently running at about a 17% ROE this 
quarter, about 
half of that on a year
-
to
-
date basis. Is there any meaningful benefit to ROE 
given the relatively modest contribution now that you see? You mentioned 
ISG and you mentioned Wealth Management. But is there anything that we 
might expect in term
s of ROE benefit from Asset Management in the next 
year or 2?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, you've identified, given it's already a high ROE business, yes, there 
tends to be less of a question there. What we've consistently been doing is 
bringing back C capital [ph] an
d investing in the core business. And so 
again, that's accretive to returns in what's already an attractive return 
business.
 
Matthew H. Burnell 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
 
Okay. And then you mentioned that there's been some greater sen
se of 
engagement from your clients post the Moody's downgrade and that 
accelerated in the third quarter. My presumption is that, that is a comment 
basically focused on your institutional clients. Can you give us a little more 
color as to the sense of the r
etail investor engagement over the course of 
the third quarter? And any color you might want to provide relative to what's 
happened since the end of the quarter.
 
Ruth Porat
 
If I'm hearing the question correctly, there were actually almost 
--
 
maybe 2 
points
 
in there. Post
-
Moody's, we had 
--
 
we saw clients really reengaging, as 
you said, in the sales and trading side, in particular, on the Fixed Income 
side, which is the area that dealt with it the most. There wasn't really a 
Moody's impact on the retail side
. And so on the retail side, the focus has 
been much more about what's going on in the macro environment. And as I 
commented, one of the impacts and the drags in the business has been, with 
the macro as weak as it had been or as volatile as it had been, we
 
had lower 
levels industry
-
wide of equity new issue products. So that affected the 
opportunity overall for retail products to go through the system. But I think 
what you see in retail, which is attractive, is the consistency of revenues 
quarter
-
after
-
quart
er.
 
James P. Gorman
 
I would just add from observing that part of the business for over a decade 
that there are periods where retail investors are completely disinterested in 
the market. There are periods when they're chasing everything that's 
moving. And t
hen there are periods when they're basically sitting on the 
sidelines. If a good product comes along, they engage. If there's a better 
tone in the market, they engage. And we are in that period. We're definitely 
not in a fearful period. We're in a period w
here the money is there, the flows 
are still positive, a lot of money sitting in cash. And when an interesting 
product is coming along, they're engaging. And when there is a firmer tone, 
whether it's from here or Europe or anywhere else internationally, we
 
see an 
uptick in activity. So as Ruth said, it's remained enormously stable during a 
pretty depressed period. And in my view, it wouldn't take a whole lot for that 
revenue outlook to turn in a positive way.
 
Matthew H. Burnell

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC

Okay. And then finally, Ruth, you mentioned the hedge funds looked like 
they're taking a bit more leverage this quarter. Could you provide a little 
additional color as to if there are specific markets or products where they 
are 
willing to put on more leverage?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think it's a pretty broad
-
based statement that we're saying. I can't pinpoint 
it to any particular market as broader.

The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Inve
stment Bank, Research Division
 
First, a quick one on CVA. Are we done there? Or is there more of that 
coming in subsequent quarters?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So you specifically asked about CVA, not DVA. Obviously, both are affected 
by movements in credit spreads, and s
o we don't forecast movements in 
credit spreads.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Right. But I think it was last quarter where you said that there was a big 
change because of the downgrade. And so I was more referring to the 
outsized
 
move as it related to that with the increased collateral.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Okay. Sorry about that. So there weren't more collateral calls this quarter, 
so you're not 
--
 
there was 
--
 
we basically had the initial flurry of collateral 
calls post the ratings action
 
in June. And it pretty much subsided even 
before we got to the second quarter earnings call. It was initial flurry and 
that was it. And so you do not see an impact from collateral calls this 
quarter.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay. Good deal. And then sticking with the capital markets, nice to see a 
pretty solid bounce
-
back there in FICC and great to hear about clients 
reengaging. Is that still 
--
 
is there still a tailwind coming there and still 
continuing to benefit you? Or d
o you feel as though everybody now is back 
and FICC is up to full speed? In other words, do we have more coming, more 
benefit?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, we always want to be doing more with our clients, so I wouldn't put an 
endpoint on it. I think that we were help
ed to have the ratings action behind 
us and clients reengage. And you can see that in the numbers. The move by 
the ECB in the summer, as I noted, I do think helped bring clients back into 
the market more broadly, that had been a big headwind as well. But i
n our 
view, we've got a very focused approach to the businesses and are looking 
to continue to build share.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Yes. Sorry if I wasn't more specific. I just meant the reengagement post
-
Moody's, if you fel
t as though at this point folks are now fully back and 
reengaged.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It's hard to disaggregate what's going on in the macro from any particular, is 
there any particular lag. Our sense is that clients have reengaged and we're 
continuing to work to b
uild market share with them. And it feels that it's 
pretty much been addressed, but I was actually very directly saying that 
we're continuing to drive share and looking at that. So it's hard to be more 
specific.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Resear
ch Division
 
Yes. No, that's fair. Aside from benefiting from the market conditions, more 
favorable market conditions as you highlighted, in the Commodities 
business, Goldman hit on weakness and specifically highlighted weakness 
there. Could you give some m
ore color on how that business went this 
quarter for you guys?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, it was 
--
 
commodities was up meaningfully versus last quarter. But as 
we noted, it was much lower last quarter. And that was due to a more 
favorable market 
environment. It is still down year
-
over
-
year. So I think 
some of the backdrop continued to be a bit challenging. And as we've 
discussed before, for us, the business is a mix of flow and structured 
solutions for clients, and it can be quite lumpy.
 
Brennan H
awken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay. And then last one for me. There was a good deal of noise made in the 
press on trends within FAs in Wealth Management. You never know how 
much of that's noise versus something real. So have you guys seen 
any 
uptick in defections post
-
integration? Have you seen any tangible evidence 
of dissatisfaction? I know the total FA headcount went up, but sometimes 
there's junior brokers that get at it and that can skew. So if you could give 
maybe some color on that, 
that'd be helpful.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, FA attrition continues to run at low levels. In fact, for the top 2 
quintiles, which is what we typically call out, the attrition was lower in the 
third quarter than it has been for the last several quarters. And if 
you look at 
metrics like annual revenue per financial advisor or assets per financial 
advisor, all of the trends are going in the right direction. So there's always 
some movement in and out. Actually, this quarter, FAs are down a bit as it 
was between the 
first and second quarter. But attrition's lower than it has 
been. Or to put it differently, retention is running at higher levels.

The next question is from Richard Ramsden with Goldman Sachs.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research D
ivision
 
I've got a question around Basel III again. Given the uncertainty around the 
outcome of the final NPRs as well as given some of the questions around the 
model approval process, is it possible to give a range of outcome for what 
your Basel III numbe
rs ultimately could be?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, the way we approach the Basel III guidance is it's based on, as I said, 
our current interpretation of the rules. What it does not include is the benefit 
of model approval, which is obviously a key part of the transi
tion. And we 
view model approvals as incremental upside. And so what we'll do is layer 
that in as we get model approvals. I mean, there are certain models that are 
kind of more foundational, like IMM. But if you look at CRM model approval, 
which I think a 
number of people 
--
 
a number are coming back to, we don't 
include the benefit of CRM model approval. So for example, in the second 
quarter, I mentioned that we estimated that our Tier 1 common ratio would 
be up about 40 basis points based on the book at th
at point in time. And the 
reason we don't bake that into our guidance, our spot guidance, is as you 
know, even when you receive CRM model approval, you have to wait a year 
to incorporate the benefit in the calculation so that by any 
--
 
under any set 
of fac
ts would be an event at least a year out. And given that the book 
changes and we're actively reducing it, the benefit changes as well. So 
although we're working to get model approval, we thought it was most 
prudent not to include the benefit of things like
 
that in the guidance we give 
you and as we put it kind of greater than 9%, and that gives us the room to 
take it up as we get model approval.
 
Richard Ramsden 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. So to be clear, you haven't included CRM. How
 
about things like 
stressed VAR and the incremental risk charge? Are those included in your 
number as well or not?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So CRM is not included, but things that 
--
 
I'll call them the kind of 
foundational models that move you from Basel I and II and th
rough the 
various regimes, like IMM or IRB, are included. It's just the specific models 
that are available and that we're clearly working on to take risk
-
weighted 
assets down as with the CRM model.
 
Richard Ramsden 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Divis
ion
 
Okay. And what do you think is a reasonable time period in terms of getting 
full model approval from the Fed, i.e. is this something that's months out? 
Or do you think it could take longer than that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, the reason we're not including it i
n our guidance is because we can't 
answer that question. So we're working on it, and I think it will take 
--
 
they 
seem to 
--
 
there's obviously a lot going on with the various moves from I to 
II to 2.5 and III. So I can't estimate the date, but we will prov
ide updates as 
the models get approved.
 
Richard Ramsden 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. And then the second question I wanted to ask. Can you confirm 
buying out the remainder of Smith Barney doesn't have a significant capital 
impact? I 
think you've said that on a couple of occasions. Given that, when 
we think about capital returns next year, should we think about buying out 
the remainder of Smith Barney versus buying back stock as an either/or 
decision? Or do you think there's potentiall
y room for you to do both?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, as I think James said, it's premature to judge the CCAR process. We 
haven't even seen the rules yet. But as you've seen from actions today and 
James' comments, the first priority is the Wealth Management joint ve
nture, 
the additional 35%, given 
--
 
or portions that I've given, the strategic value 
of the business. So at this point, it's premature to judge CCAR.

James Gorman
 
Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Before handing over 
the call here to Ruth, I wanted to give some brief remarks about our results 
and update you on our strategic initiatives.
 
Our 
quarterly financial results were clearly affected by the significant slowing 
of capital markets again last quarter and continued through the summer and 
into September. Volumes and client activity across our businesses, 
particularly in the first half of the
 
quarter, were weak as institutional and 
retail investors continued to avoid risk assets.
 
That said, this quarter we achieved some key milestones in shaping our 
future and the firm delivered improved performance across investment 
banking, wealth management
, and asset management. While these 
businesses performed well, our aggregate results for the quarter were 
disappointing and do not reflect the full potential of this franchise.
 
Morgan Stanley remains a work in progress. We are rebalancing the firm to 
more 
effectively leverage our capital base and balance sheet. We are 
adopting a model consistent with the legislative changes emanating from the 
Dodd
-
Frank bill and the regulatory changes being crystallized through Basel 
III.
 
We are reallocating our capital and
 
our balance sheet away from proprietary 
businesses and reinvesting it in our client businesses. An initiative this 
quarter consistent with this rebalancing was the restructuring of our 
ownership in the hedge fund, FrontPoint Partners whereby we will 
signi
ficantly reduce our total ownership.
 
Within our business segments, we saw progress in many areas, although 
some businesses clearly remain subdued, most notably fixed income, as 
Ruth will detail in a moment. In institutional securities, we are broadening 
ou
r client footprint and expanding our strengths and capabilities. This was 
evidenced by increased market share in all capital markets' underwriting 
products, as well as the improvement in our institutional investor rankings.
 
In global wealth management, whi
le progress will never be a straight line, 
we saw improvement on our key metrics including pretax margin and net 
new money flows, while delivering steady revenue in a very challenging 
environment.
 
Encouragingly, retail investor activity appeared to bottom 
earlier in the 
quarter. The build of our technology platform is expected to be completed by 
the third quarter of next year, followed by a series of rollouts extending into 
2012. Key decisions on the integration are being made and being executed. 
While this
 
is a complex integration task, we have no major concerns about 
the plans or progress, although as we previously said, financial performance 
of the business is obviously somewhat market
-
dependent.
 
In asset management, we continue to restructure the busines
s, as evidenced 
by our reduced ownership in FrontPoint Partners and the hiring of several 
talented executives into the long
-
only institutional business. We will be 
rolling out more detailed plans in coming months.
 
Let me finish briefly by commenting on the
 
regulation environment. The 
regulatory changes are real, permanent and will fundamentally reshape the 
industry. With respect to capital, Ruth will outline the potential impact on 
our risk
-
weighted assets under the proposed framework. Morgan Stanley is 
emb
racing the changes, rapidly evolving our business model to position our 
firm to thrive in the future.
 
Now, please I'll turn it over to Ruth for more details on the specific third 
quarter results.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, James. For the quarter ended September
 
30, income from 
continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley was $313 million with 
diluted earnings per share of $0.05 after preferred dividend.
 
Our results this quarter reflected muted performance within our fixed income 
business. At the same time,
 
corporate clients reengaged in investment 
banking and our wealth and asset management businesses delivered 
modestly higher profits with positive fund flows. Our revenues included the 
negative impact from the tightening of credit spreads on firm issued 
str
uctured notes, commonly referred to as DVA, of approximately $731 
million or $0.30 per share.
 
Specifically, our third quarter revenues were $6.8 billion, down 15% 
sequentially or up 4% normalizing for DVA in each period. Our non
-
interest 
expenses were $6 b
illion, down 4% from last quarter, primarily on lower 
compensation. The firm
-
wide compensation ratio was 54%. Excluding DVA, 
the compensation ratio was 49%. Non
-
compensation expenses were $2.3 
billion, down 3% from last quarter, primarily due to lower brok
erage and 
clearing and professional services expenses.
 
Results for the quarter also included $176 million or $0.12 per share 
associated with the repatriation of non
-
U.S. earnings at a cost lower than 
originally estimated. Excluding this, the quarterly effe
ctive tax rate from 
continuing operations would have been 19.1%. Including discontinued 
operations, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.07, which included 
a loss of $229 million associated with the planned disposition of Revel. The 
remaining car
rying value of this investment is approximately $40 million.
 
Turning to our book value on Page 3 of the supplement, book value at the 
end of the quarter was $31.25 per share, up 5% sequentially, primarily due 
to the issuance of $5.6 billion in common equit
y to CIC.
 
Turning to the balance sheet data on the same page, total assets were $841 
billion at September 30, an increase of 4% from the second quarter, 
primarily driven by interest rate products and prime brokerage.
 
Our capital ratios continue to demonstr
ate the strength of our balance sheet. 
Although our calculations are not final, we believe our Tier 1 capital ratio 
under Basel I will be 16.5% and our Tier 1 common ratio will be 10.8%. 
Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $
326 
billion as of September 30.
 
With respect to Basel III, many rules still require interpretation and final rule 
writing. Based on our analysis of the guidelines to date, we believe that our 
third quarter balance sheet under Basel III would result in our 
risk
-
weighted 
assets increasing pro forma by approximately $240 billion. This increase 
would be prior to run
-
off and mitigation opportunities, which we estimate 
would reduce RWAs by approximately $100 billion by the end of 2012 for a 
net RWA increase of ab
out $140 billion or approximately 40%.
 
The primary driver of the increase in our RWAs is higher market risk for 
securitization and structured credit correlation products and credit risk for 
counterparty exposures. These are clearly preliminary estimates wh
ich are 
subject to final guidelines by the Federal Reserve.
 
 
I will now briefly review our business units. For institutional securities on 
Page 5 of the supplement, revenues were $2.9 billion, down from the second 
quarter on lower client volume and lower t
rading results across the sales and 
trading businesses, particularly fixed income.
 
Revenues included approximately $731 million of negative DVA as 
mentioned earlier. Normalizing for DVA, revenues were down 3% for the 
quarter. Principal investment 
revenues of $387 million included gains of 
approximately $313 million on an investment held by consolidated 
investment partnership with other third
-
party investors.
 
Non
-
interest expenses were $2.7 billion in the quarter, down 9% 
sequentially on lower compe
nsation and non
-
compensation expenses. The 
compensation ratio was 52% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of DVA, 
the compensation ratio was 41%. The business reported a pretax profit of 
$240 million.
 
 
With respect to investment banking, revenues were $1 
billion, up 14% from 
last quarter. For the first nine months of 2010, Morgan Stanley ranked first 
in global IPOs, second in global completed M&A, and third in global 
announced M&A and global equity. During the quarter, we gained share 
across capital market
s' underwriting products, including global equity, as 
well as investment
-
grade and high yield debt. And we led significant deals in 
the market, including three of the top five transactions in global equity and 
in global IPOs.
 
Advisory revenues of $371 mill
ion were up 29% sequentially, driven by an 
increase in the number of closed transactions. We advised on significant 
announced M&A transactions in the quarter, including International Power's 
$25 billion acquisition by GDF Suez Energy.
 
Equity underwriting r
evenues were $260 million, down 3% from last quarter 
on lower volumes in Europe. Significant transactions included bookrunner 
positions for the two largest equity offerings this quarter, Agricultural Bank 
of China's $12 billion IPO and Petrobras' $69 billi
on follow
-
on offering.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 15% sequentially to $377 
million on higher investment and non
-
investment grade bond issuance, 
partially offset by lower loan syndication fees. Significant transactions 
included Valeant Pha
rmaceuticals' $2.8 billion loan facility and $1.2 billion 
high yield bond offering, as well as Aon Corporation's $2.5 billion bridge and 
term loan to acquire Hewitt Associates.
 
Overall, our investment banking pipelines remain healthy across products 
and re
gions and continued to improve from last quarter.
 
Turning to equity sales and trading on Page 6, equity sales and trading 
reported revenues of $925 million that included the negative impact of DVA 
of $196 million. Cash equity revenues were down from the se
cond quarter as 
market volumes declined sharply. However, commission levels outpaced 
overall market activity across most geographies. Prime brokerage revenues 
remained flat against the backdrop of declining hedge fund leverage. 
However, balances trended up
 
in September, ending well above the 
quarterly average.
 
Derivatives revenues declined meaningfully on lower client activity and lower 
volatility versus the second quarter. Of note, our Asian equity business was 
up about 25% versus the second quarter, drive
n by significantly stronger 
client flows than overall market activity.
 
Turning to fixed income sales and trading, revenues of $846 million included 
the negative impact of DVA of $464 million. During the quarter, we 
continued to execute on improving distrib
ution and footprint within interest 
rates, FX, and emerging markets.
 
Within our Interest Rate, Credit and Currencies business, IRCC, credit 
corporate's performance was up meaningfully versus the second quarter with 
particular strength in investment grade. 
Interest rates revenues were up 
modestly from the previous quarter and FX revenues declined significantly 
on lower client flows and lower trading revenue.
 
IRCC results were also negatively impacted by hedging losses of $272 
million from the tightening of m
onoline credit spreads. In commodities, 
revenues were also lower on weaker client activity as markets continued to 
be range
-
bound. Other sales and trading negative revenues of $341 million 
primarily reflect funding costs, including the amounts liquidity be
ing held by 
the U.S. banks, as well as the component of DVA.
 
Turning to Value
-
at
-
Risk on pages 3 and 6 of the supplement, total average 
trading and non
-
trading VaR increased to $189 million from $164 million in 
the second quarter, driven primarily by non
-
t
rading VaR. Average trading 
VaR was relatively unchanged at $142 million compared to $139 million in 
the second quarter as increased interest rate and credit risk was offset by 
reduced foreign exchange risk. However, average non
-
trading VaR increased 
to $1
03 million from $67 million, primarily driven by the increase in the 
value of our investment in Invesco.
 
With respect to our global wealth management business summarized on 
Page 8 of the supplement, revenues of $3.1 billion were relatively 
unchanged from l
ast quarter as higher trading and net interest income offset 
lower commissions in asset management revenue. Non
-
interest expenses 
were $2.8 billion, down 2% from last quarter on lower compensation. The 
compensation ratio was 62%, driven by the formulaic gr
id payout, but offset 
by reduced non
-
FA comp expense.
 
Integration related costs were approximately $83 million in the quarter. 
Profit before tax was $281 million and the PVT margin was 9%, up from 7% 
last quarter. On Page 9 of the supplement, you can see t
he quarterly 
productivity measures for the business. Total client assets increased 7% 
sequentially to $1.6 trillion on market appreciation with asset inflows of $5 
billion in the quarter. The number of FAs was relatively unchanged at 18,119 
and turnover wi
thin our top two quintiles remained well below our target.
 
Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $109 billion, of which $52 billion 
is held by Morgan Stanley banks. The Bank Deposit Program represents the 
majority of the $61 billion in firm
-
wide deposi
ts at quarter
-
end across global 
wealth management and institutional securities.
 
Now, turning to asset management on Page 10 of our supplement. Net 
revenues were $802 million, up substantially from the second quarter. Core 
asset management generated revenue
s of $380 million, up 27% sequentially 
due to positive marks on seed investments and higher performance fees.
 
Merchant banking revenues of $422 million increased significantly from last 
quarter, driven by principal investment gains in real estate and priva
te 
equity. Approximately $203 million of these investment gains were from 
consolidated MSREF fund. As such, given the ownership structure of these 
funds, the majority of the gains are passed to third
-
party investors in the 
non
-
controlling interest line. Ap
proximately $83 million of the investment 
gains were from private equity, primarily driven by Asian investments.
 
Non
-
interest expenses for asset management were up 5% from last quarter 
on higher non
-
compensation expenses that included a $31 million 
impairm
ent charge on FrontPoint intangibles. PVT was $279 million for a 
margin of 35%. Excluding the gains attributable to the non
-
controlling 
interest, the segment was profitable with PVT of $86 million for a margin of 
14%.
 
As summarized on Page 11 of the supple
ment, total AUM increased 9% to 
$273 billion, primarily due to higher market levels and asset inflows which 
totaled $2.9 billion during the quarter. As of August 2010, over 70% of our 
long
-
term strategies continued to outperform their respective benchmarks
 
on a three, five, and 10
-
year basis.
 
Let me end by commenting on our outlook. Obviously, the key variables 
regarding our performance are tied to the global market environment and 
executing on the opportunities created in that environment. Emerging 
markets
 
activity remains robust based on the volume seen in the third 
quarter, as well as what we see in the backlog going into the fourth quarter. 
We believe that firms with a global presence, such as Morgan Stanley, are 
well positioned to benefit from this acti
vity.
 
However, the key question remains ""opportunities in developed markets."" 
Although growth in developed economics continues to be fragile, we are 
cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the next year. First, we have seen 
signs of activity beginning 
to pick up in September across our businesses. 
Corporate balance sheets remain cash
-
rich and clients are using cash for 
repurchase, which is providing some support to the equity markets and for 
M&A. And the pace of activity with retail investors, as James 
noted, has also 
picked up.
 
That being said and given the fragility of the recovery, it is too early to 
assume that these trends are going to continue. For example, policy 
decisions could still affect the scope of recovery. With three potentially 
important 
upcoming events, the expected quantitative easing from the Fed, 
the U.S. midterm elections, and the G
-
20 Meeting in Seoul in November, it's 
premature to gauge their impact on markets and investors.
 
Though the industry faces near
-
term cyclical challenges, w
e view capital 
markets as having long
-
term secular growth opportunities. We remain very 
focused on disciplined execution of our strategy to continue the building and 
enhancing of our global footprint.
 
Thank you. And now, we will take any questions you may 
have.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator instructions) We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A 
roster. The first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
Nomura
 
Thanks very much. Point of 
clarification maybe, Ruth, on the other sales and 
trading loss. In your text, you talked about primarily it affecting funding 
costs and the liquidity held at the U.S. sub banks. Can you just give us a 
little more color on it, because it sounds like somethi
ng that's been there all 
along, we just didn't know about it?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, first hello and welcome. The main components in the category, other 
sales and trading, do 

 
have included corporate lending and relationship and 
leverage lending, credit spread 
impact on CIC, funding related costs, and a 
few other items.
 
This quarter 

 
for the third quarter, the items were first, the amortization of 
the value of the de
-
designated hedges related to the 2008 debt buyback and 
retirement program 

 
you may recall, we 
talked about that over several 
quarters, going back sometime; increased liquidity; the negative carry in the 
U.S. banks' portfolio as we build out the bank; a $71 million loss on credit 
spread tightening on our debt related to CIC's investment. And so the 
impact 
of mark
-
to
-
market P&L and corporate lending, which we had in prior 
quarters was not material this quarter.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
Nomura
 
Got you. So this 

 
sounds like there is a ongoing cost there, like you said on 
liquidity and funding at the bank that is
 
part of the ongoing operating, and in 
a steady
-
state world will be there. I just 

 
am I thinking about that the right 
way? In other words, the $341 million this quarter had offsets in other 
quarters, maybe through leverage lending or something else, but j
ust didn't 
have offset this quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Right. Exactly. Leverage loans were muted this quarter, so we didn't have 
the offset. But you are right, you characterized it correctly.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
Nomura
 
Okay, cool. Moving on, just in terms of CIC franc
hise, I think people have 
had their expectation set on, it takes a while to build or rebuild a client 
franchise. But with VaR up a little bit and trading efficiency obviously down 
this quarter, I'm just curious, think 

 
how much of that is 

 
it takes time 
to 
build the client franchise versus a conscious decision to de
-
risk in a slow 
quarter versus are there legacy positions dragging? Just if you could help 
talk through some of that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The primary issue is really the first one you articulated, which
 
we have 
stressed for quite some time, which is we are still building the footprint and 
it takes time to realize the positive benefit of the investment.
 
So as we look at the quarter, in particular a slow July and August, what we 
saw were lower client volum
es. We didn't have a lot of client activity and as 
a result, we didn't see as many trading opportunities coming out of the client 
flow. So while we didn't make a lot of money, we also didn't lose a lot of 
money, but it's very much in our view the first poi
nt that it takes time and 
we said this repeatedly, this is about quarters to build the position that we 
expect to have.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
Nomura
 
Cool. And then 

 
I appreciate the commentary on the Basel III walk
-
through 
and risk
-
weighted assets. Could you hel
p on the numeric side, or more 
importantly, where does that shake out at the end of 2012 in terms of 
steady
-
state ratio now, add in forward earnings, subtract out the changes on 
both mitigation, high
-
risk weightings, and the roll
-
forward?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, wh
at we were attempting to give is an analysis of RWAs and obviously, 
this is preliminary and there is still interpretation to come. Our Tier 1 
common equity at September 30 is estimated to be approximately $35 
billion. There are many items that can impact c
apital between now and 
2013. So as I said, we are comfortable with our position, we are confident in 
meeting all the requirements of Basel 2.5 and III and wanted to give you the 
RWAs so you could do your roll
-
forward.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
Nomura
 
Understood. And 
last one, on Smith Barney, is that a contractual buy
-
in on 
May '12, '13, and '14 or do you have any optionality there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
That is an option.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
Nomura
 
That's option? Okay. So you have to make an assumption on whether or not 
you would ex
ercise the option, because it's a big capital impart [ph].
 
James Gorman
 
It's an open
-
ended call option.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
Nomura
 
Got it 

 
got it. Okay, cool. Thank you. Thanks, James.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Guy 
Moszkowski with Bank of America.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Hello, Guy.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Bank of America
 
Good morning, Ruth. Good morning, James.
 
James Gorman
 
Hi, Guy.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Bank of America
 
We can see the impact of the capital coming in from CIC on your supplem
ent 
Page 4, to the parent company. And I'm just wondering whether you intend 
to retain it there or whether you would look at allocating some of that down 
to the operating units, in particular the investment bank.
 
Ruth Porat
 
We retained it there, as we've t
alked about in prior quarters, with the 
assumption that it will be allocated over time as we have greater clarity on 
Basel 2.5, III, but that is precisely the intent.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Bank of America
 
Okay, thanks. And just to follow up on the Basel III que
stion and your 
comments about RWA, can you give us any more detail on the type of 
mitigation actions that you would envision?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. There are really two major categories. One is run
-
off, primarily the 
securitization book and correlation book. An
d the other is a more modest 
estimate of additional sales out of our merchant banking portfolio, hedge 
fund stakes, et cetera that will release capital and therefore RWA.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Bank of America
 
Right, which in a sense is mandated under Dodd
-
Frank
 
anyway, right?
 
Ruth Porat
 
It is, although we like to underscore that it was strategically something we 
have been quite focused on even prior to Dodd
-
Frank and core to the way 
we are looking at where we want to take the business prospectively and very 
much
 
a focus of Greg Fleming's since his arrival here.
 
James Gorman
 
We 

 
actually Guy, we started this review probably 18 months ago to look at 
all the capital we have tied up in our principal investing businesses and the 
percent in each of the funds that we h
ave, the seed capital that we have 
across our various asset management businesses, and obviously our 
ownership stake. So it's been a very long and thought
-
through process and 
we are right in the middle of executing on it now.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Bank of Ameri
ca
 
And that comment is sort of a good segue into a follow
-
up question on 
FrontPoint. Can you give us a little bit more of a sense for exactly what's 
happening there strategically, what drove that given that 

 
my 
understanding there is that was really a cus
tomer investment business 
rather than tying up a lot of Morgan Stanley's capital. And finally, what 

 
is 
there any further charge that we might anticipate in the fourth quarter 
beyond the goodwill impairment that you mentioned that took place this 
quarter?
 
James Gorman
 
On 

 
FrontPoint was 

 
firstly, I think it is challenging for institutions like us 
for lots of reasons, including conflict to own 

 
fully own 100% of hedge 
funds. Secondly, we do have about $300 million of seed capital tied up in 
FrontPoint an
d we obviously have a plan to 

 
it's sort of more than that [ph] 

 
we have a plan to repatriate that over relatively short period of time.
 
And we just feel comfortable as a minority stakeholder with a different 
structure of compensating us as a 
minority holder, if you will, in terms of 
revenue share than we had as a 100% owner. So it has multiple benefits 
and it clarifies what we do and it clarifies what FrontPoint does and allows 
them to go about their business.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Bank of America
 
Got it, thanks. I just have one more question, which is on global wealth 
management. The largest single revenue item there is of course the asset 
management driven fees and they have been extremely consistent. Can you 
just give us a sense for what percent 
of those fees are actual 

 
actually 
based on customer assets under control and to what extent there might be 
some variability beyond just what happens to markets?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, I'm on a roll here, so why don't I just continue? The asset 
management fee
s in that business are a mix obviously of the total assets in 
the various forms of asset management accounts, the discretionary accounts 
through to the fund
-
of
-
funds accounts, the managed money accounts, and 
the sort of priced fee accounts.
 
So they are a f
unction of three things; one is the pricing
-
only accounts, two 
is the absolute asset volumes in the market, and three is the flow of new 
assets either from outside the firm or existing assets from within the firm 
that get moved into those accounts as clien
ts prefer to pay by fee.
 
All of those three things have been positive in that business. It reflects a 
very strong Smith Barney leverage 

 
legacy in this space, which is now 
being applied to the former Morgan Stanley Dean Witter business. And that's 
why we 
are seeing, I think, the increase in absolute asset levels and in 
revenues from it. And it's a good thing for the business.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Bank of America
 
Great. Thanks very much to both of you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come 
from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning, Roger.
 
Roger Freeman 

 
Barclays Capital
 
Good morning. I guess a couple of questions around your Basel III initial 
take here. I guess, one is with respect to mitigation, as you are thinking 
about the roll
-
offs, are you just looking at this as passive or is there 

 
are 
there more sort of active tear
-
ups, et cetera that you are pursuing? And 
actually to that point, it sounds like your RWA at least on a gross basis is 
going up 75%. That's a lot 
lower than what your sort of prior 

 
obviously 
pre
-
Basel III estimate was, and possibly a doubling a year ago. It seems like 
you've made a whole lot of progress here.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, two things that 

 
to your point, a preliminary estimate and we would 
rathe
r plan for the worst and hope for the best, but the rules have continued 
to provide clarity and they are obviously still a bit preliminary. But we think 
that from what we have today, we feel comfortable that we are looking, as 
you said, about a 75% increas
e.
 
With respect to mitigation, we are looking at roll
-
offs, as I said, from the 
existing book. We assume that we will be able to do tear
-
ups as well. But we 

estimate. So wasn't 
in, I assume it will be in, do assume it's logical.
 
Roger Freeman 

 
Barclays Capital
 
Do you still think that the central clearing ultimately will be a big benefit 
here as well? I think you had mentioned that last time we talked.
 
Ruth Porat
 
We assume it wil
l. And again, there are added steps that we hope will 
continue to layer into the calculation over time. And that, to your point, 
would be one.
 
Roger Freeman 

 
Barclays Capital
 
Okay. And just lastly, on that topic, do you anticipate running at some sort 
of 
a buffer above even whatever is systemic for the Fed is going to call for?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think 

 
again 

 
we know the floor is 7% and there are various assumptions 
as to how much above that will be required as a systemically critical 
institution and the 
counter
-
cyclical buffer. So we want to see where those 
numbers come out and depending on where they come out, we will assess 
the appropriateness of buffer, any size of buffer.
 
Roger Freeman 

 
Barclays Capital
 
Okay. And just one other thing. On your 
mark on Revel, can you just sort of 
help us think about that one a little bit? I know it's basically down to zero 
now. But was there something specific on that investment, given that 
commercial real estate prices were broadly flat in the quarter and also, 
you 
actually had gains in other real estate funds. So maybe it's a geography 
issue or 

?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, when we decided to sell the business in earlier this year and we 
evaluated the most likely value to be received, we have a year in which to 
sell it. A
s we progress with discussions with buyers, our best assessment 
now with the benefit of more information is that we need 

 
the value is 
lower and thus we are required to write down the carrying value by about 
$200 million. To your point, our current carryi
ng value is now only about $40 
million.
 
James Gorman
 
I'd just add to that, Roger. The valuation of that property is affected less by 
commercial real estate players and the valuations of the gaming industry 
and customer spend and traffic and so on, and spec
ifically gaming industry 
in Atlantic City. This is, after all, a half
-
built casino in Atlantic City.
 
Roger Freeman 

 
Barclays Capital
 
Yes, not a lot of value in that. Okay. Thanks a lot, both of you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.

The next question will come fro
m Mike Mayo with CLSA.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
Good morning.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Hi, Mike.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
First, on the positive side, can you comment on what happened linked 
quarter in Asia? Looks like those revenues were up three
-
fourths.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. So in the Asi
an business, we saw increases across a number of the 
businesses. Our advisory business was up 180%. You saw a lot of the 
headlines with strong equity underwriting, issuances, and IPOs. The equity 
markets did not see the kind of market volume declines that 
we saw in the 
U.S. and Europe and within the fixed income business, up 61% in IRCC, 
which was FX and credit corporate. So, real broad strength in Asia.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
And should we expect that level going forward or is that anything kind of 
temporary the
re?
 
Ruth Porat
 
From what we have seen, it continues to be strong. Whether we can expect 
anything of that magnitude, I would certainly not want to leave you with 
that assumption. But the pipeline is strong, in particular in China.
 
James Gorman
 
And longer te
rm, strategically, Asia and China specifically have become 
much more important to Morgan Stanley, given our CIC relationship, our 
significant business in the Mainland and out of Hong Kong, and our business 
in other parts of 

 
regional parts of Asia.
 
Mike M
ayo 

 
CLSA
 
And then separately, following up on Basel III, first, are you running your 
systems in parallel yet with Basel II?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
How many quarters have you been running in parallel?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We entered parallel run on 
July 1.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
Okay. And then, I might have missed it. What is your Tier 1 common ratio 
under Basel III?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We 

 
you didn't miss it. We actually 

 
what we provided is the RWA 

 
our 
best estimate, let me put it that way, at the RWA roll
-
fo
rward and our best 
estimate at some of the run
-
off opportunities. Our Tier 1 common at 
September 30 was approximately $35 billion and there are a number of 
items that can affect capital between now and then. So we wanted to give 
you the RWA's to let you la
yer that in.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
So what we have to go with right now is $35 billion divided by $466 billion, 
with no other adjustments? But there could be some adjustments, I guess to 
the numerator.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Right. And 

 
so it's $565 billion prior to any r
un
-
off, and then $465 billion.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
Okay. And can you give any rough sense of the impact to numerator? I 
guess that could go down some, the $35 billion, or are you 

 
think that will 
be 

?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, that 

 
I think that's all I'm prepared to
 
say on that topic.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
Okay.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
All right, thanks a lot.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.

Howard Chen 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Hi, good morning.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning, Howard.
 
Howard Chen 

 
Credit Suisse
 
James, I believe you noted at a recent conference your view that returns will 
restore back to the high
-
teens over time. I was just hoping you could 
expand upon that comment, and maybe frame what 
type of macro 
conditions and regulatory assumptions you broadly think about in achieving 
that goal.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, that's a large question, Howard, which I think we would have to have 
another conference to answer it accurately. Clearly, we have in our 
hand the 
ability to turn the dial up and down on the various businesses that we have.
 
And if we look across our businesses, historically, wealth management 
businesses have generated returns of up to 45% return on capital; asset 
management businesses have g
enerated returns between 25% and 35%; 
core investment banking businesses, effectively infinity; and the sales and 
trading businesses, as you know, it depends which business and how much 
balance sheet you are using and with what risk and so on. And that's w
here 
you have dollar [ph] turning ability.
 
So as we think about the various pieces that make up Morgan Stanley, take 
into account obviously the risk
-
weighted asset changes, and as we 
extrapolate privately on what the numerator number that the previous, I 
t
hink it was Roger or Mike was calling about, we clearly believe the industry 
and those that have survived the financial crisis and have consolidated 
positions are in a position, if well managed, to extract that kind of mid
-
high 
teen returns that we talked 
about.
 
So it's 

 
obviously, our long
-
term desire is to meet and exceed our cost to 
capital and we have a lot of levers that we are working on.
 
Howard Chen 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Great. That's helpful context. And I realize it's a big question. And then, just 
give
n the mortgage foreclosure concerns in the marketplace, I was just 
hoping to get your perspective on the legal climate and the liability in your 
view from your activities as an originator, service securitizer within the 
market.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, I think it's 
obviously kind of a fluid topic. I think like other financial 
institutions, we have been named a defendant in cases in connection with 
CDOs and RMBS. And as you know, we don't comment on individual 
litigation unless we have concluded they are material to t
he firm or 
disclosures otherwise are required or meaningful.
 
So I think at this point, there is really no update that we have. We are 
obviously watching, but I would refer you to the legal proceedings section of 
our most recent filings.
 
Howard Chen 

 
Credi
t Suisse
 
Okay, thanks. And then just I guess switching gears, Ruth, just where are 
we just broadly in the cost synergy realization on the global wealth 
management JV?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We are very much on track, continuing to execute on the integration.
 
Howard Ch
en 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay. Is there a specific number of kind of where 

 
what you have achieved 
out of the broader target?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We could probably piece together from the disclosure we have had today, we 
are about halfway through.
 
Howard Chen 

 
Credit S
uisse
 
Okay, many thanks. And then just last question on my end. Could we just 
get a brief update on the retail banking strategy? I know you noted, Ruth, 
kind of where the deposits lie, but I think you might have had a key 
departure from the business during
 
the quarter, and I just wanted to know if 
there was any shift in how you broadly think about retail banking.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, fair question. Let me take that one. We 

 
a couple of years ago, when 
we hired, and the person you are talking about is CC Sutto
n, who is a terrific 
person and has gone to run part of Citigroup's retail banking network. She 
came out of that kind of job at Wachovia. When she joined us a couple of 
years ago, we were contemplating as in the world of turmoil and change in 
financial ser
vices of a potential roll
-
up strategy of different retail banking 
networks attaching them to our brokerage business.
 
Subsequent to that thinking, however, which was not particularly well 
formed 

 
it was just opportunistic and we were exploring what was 
available 
in raising our deposit base. Subsequent to that thinking, we conducted the 
Smith Barney transaction, which has exposed us to obviously a much larger 
retail client base, nearly 1,000 offices domestically and a lot more deposits 
ultimately.
 
So, we 
had a change in strategy, which was to instead of buying banks with 
all the integration challenges associated with that, we decided to build 
effectively a shadow private bank by putting private bankers in each of our 
major complexes around the country.
 
And
 
that process is well underway, it's generating significant loan 
particularly in deposit interest, and we expect it to be a very important part 
of our strategy going forward and it has a different compensable revenue 
structure than traditional equities and
 
securities businesses. So it's well on 
track. We wish CC well, she's a great person. And the business remains on 
track and is of a different style and type than what we anticipated.
 
Howard Chen 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Excellent. Thanks for the update on everythin
g.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.

The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.
 
Michael Carrier 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks. Ruth, just one follow
-
up on Basel. I think a lot of firms when they 
are giving these updates when they get 
more clarity, one is they are giving 
the adjusted or the new RWA number with some mitigation and roll
-
offs. 
And then just on the capital side, it's sort of flowing through, so you are 
looking at apples to apples on 2012.
 
So when we look at that $35 billion
 
and we are looking forward, obviously 
we will all come up with our return on equity over the next year or two for 
you guys to generate. And I guess the other big piece would be just the 
MUFG in that conversion, and the price is obviously higher than where
 
the 
current price is today. So I guess any update on that, and I guess at least 
from the regulators' perspective, is that demand for a convert, do you 
assume that that's already going to be in there or do you feel like you got to 
wait until it actually co
nverts and it's into common for you guys to have 
more flexibility?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We 

 
it is 

 
the terms of conversion are obviously based on the stock price 
threshold, and we haven't assumed anything in here because this is actually 
a 

 
as I said, a snapshot 
at 9/30, our capital position at 9/30, and so that's 
kind of one point. The second point, I think it was obvious, but when you 
started asking the question, I just wanted to make sure it is. With respect to 
the securitization framework and the deducts to ca
pital, what we have done 
is convert this to an RWA equivalent. So that was just one piece I wanted to 
make sure was clear.
 
Michael Carrier 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Yes, I was just getting to the $35 billion is as of today, and just saying that 
if we assume that you
 
have to have the ratios in place by 2012, is that $35 
billion can grow into that RWA number.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.
 
Michael Carrier 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. And then just second, and I guess this is for James, just on the ROE 
question and I guess there's long term 
and maybe medium
-
term. I think if 
you look across the landscape, obviously it was a challenging quarter for 
most firms. And you guys are a little bit unique because, one is, I think you 
are still building out in certain areas where you might have had some 
relative strength during the quarter, and other firms were better positioned 
just because they already have a build
-
out.
 
And then there's other things that maybe just from a 

 
particularly on the 
trading side, just either there were more severe hits or jus
t from a risk 
management standpoint, maybe not as well positioned. I'm just trying to I 
guess gauge that, because if you look at the adjusted ROE of like a 4% 
versus some out there putting up like a 10%. Just trying to gauge, what is 
sort of very specific 
to the quarter versus over the next quarter or two, as 
long as the build
-
out takes place, do you still feel like you can get to a pretty 
decent or competitive ROE?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, there is a lot in that. Let me give you just a couple of reactions and I 
think your opening comment was the best one, which is that we take a long
-

month quarter where the world was trying to understand whether we would 
have a sovereign debt crisis in Europe a
nd whether we would have a double
-
dip recession in the U.S., and whether China would be in for a hard landing. 
So, we have to take a longer
-
term view, as I'm sure and I know you 
understand.
 
We 

 
listen, we think we have the right mix of businesses. Our bus
iness 
model is pretty straightforward. We spun off Discover, we spun off Van 
Kampen, we have now spun off FrontPoint, we spun off MSCI. We are 
focused on businesses that are involved in the origination, distribution, and 
management of capital. We have a lo
t of dials that I talked about earlier that 
we can turn.
 
But we are in a transition period. And we are focused on disciplined 
execution, not making mistakes, not creating drags unnecessarily on our 
business, but respecting the fact we have to invest in our
 
platform, our 
distribution, and our flow businesses to get to the scale that gives us the 
ROE kind of numbers that I talked about earlier. And we are right in the 
middle of that investment now, whether it be Smith Barney, whether it be 
our fixed income cr
oss rates, emerging markets, foreign exchange, 
particularly equity derivatives, you name it. We are making those 
investments, because we are planning for the long run.
 
Michael Carrier 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. Thanks to both of you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
The final question will come from Mark Lane of William Blair.
 
Mark Lane 

 
William Blair
 
Good morning. Just two quick ones. So in the global wealth management 
business, the last several quarters you have given us the non
-
recurring 
expense that's ru
nning through the income statement. What's that number 
this quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
That was $83 million this quarter.
 
Mark Lane 

 
William Blair
 
Okay. And then I guess for James, on the fixed income trading side, so I 
acknowledge that it was a slow quarter fro
m an activity perspective and you 
are still building, but how would you assess the quality of the quarter based 
on the people that you have right now? Was it an acceptable quarter from an 
execution perspective? Could you do a lot better with the people tha
t you 
have? It's difficult to get a sense of how you feel, how you perform with 
what you have got.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, let me take a cut at it, and Ruth may want to add to it. Firstly, again, 
not to be silly about it, but quarters come around pretty quickly
. In fact, 
they have an unnerving frequency of every 13 weeks, and this 13 weeks, we 
had a very, very difficult July on the flow side and the various positions we 
took, we had modest performance. It was a slow August, and it was a late 
Labor Day September.
 
So we are in a rebuild. We have hired, I believe, 70% of our target hires for 
this year. Most of those people came on board in the second quarter and the 
third quarter, and we expect them to be sort of fully productive by the first 
quarter of next year. I
t takes people with (inaudible) and all that sort of 
stuff, three, six months to get up and running.
 
So we feel pretty good about the footprint build
-
out. We are not exactly 
where we want to be, but we are a lot better off than we were 12 months 
ago. And i
t's going to 

 
that takes a little time to root itself. We also put in 
place the senior relationship management program, which is covering our 
top institutional clients and that business is in 

 
we have made some 
significant hires into that business. So we
 
have made a lot of progress, but 
this is not a 

 
this is not something that's going to happen with 

 
in any 13
-
week period. We are just looking for progress.

James P. Gorman
 
Good morning, and thank you, Celeste. As we close the door on 2012 and 
open one on 2013, I want to share my thoughts with you on the state of 
Morgan Stanley and where we're headed. To do so, we're going to have a 
different kind of earnings 
call. I'll give you a strategic update, and we'll have 
a dozen or so slides, which we've prepared for you to follow along with, and 
they're on the website, as Celeste said. Then Ruth is going to take you 
through the normal quarterly review, and we'll both 
take questions at the 
end.
 
Why are we doing it this way today? It's because we believe Morgan Stanley 
is at a turning point. Importantly, we see a clear path to meeting and then 
exceeding our cost of equity, and we want to lay it out for you.
 
While we live
 
in a world of continued regulatory uncertainty as we wait final 
rules on derivatives reform, Volcker and resolution authority, which will bring 
significant changes to the markets, we are controlling what we can control. 
We have strong and leading capital 
ratios, we have a clear path for wealth 
management and we're being aggressive with our cost base. We have 
reduced fixed income risk
-
weighted assets even faster than we had initially 
planned and have a clear path to what we consider to be the end state in 
t
hat business.
 
We've been carefully trying to balance being aggressive where we can, and 
you can see this in our expense cuts and RWA reductions, but not making 
decisions that might seem wise in the very short term but may in fact be 
harmful to medium
-
 
and 
long
-
term shareholder value. I will outline the 5 
strategic initiatives that led us to meeting and 
--
 
that will lead us to meeting 
and achieving our cost of capital. And again, you can follow along with the 
available slides.
 
Let me go into greater detail o
n what we're doing to drive higher returns. 
First, wealth management. Subject to CCAR approval, we intend to own 
100% of wealth management this year. There are numerous benefits 
associated with owning 100%, including year 1 incremental earnings 
comparable 
to the capital required to buy the remaining 35%, driven by the 
elimination of NCI, contractual revenue upside and some expense savings 
from the elimination of the JV structure. We will also increase our stable 
deposit funding and have significant other op
portunities.
 
We have previously laid out a mid
-
teen margin goal for the middle of this 
year. We reached and exceeded that goal in the fourth quarter of 2012. We 
believe that in the future we can drive margins to the high teens and above 
with modest revenue
 
growth, although please keep in mind the first quarter 
margin is seasonally lower. With 3 quarters 
--
 
3 years of integration behind 
us, we are extraordinarily excited about the potential for this business.
 
The second major driver of high returns is fixed 
income. Since the financial 
crisis, we've reduced risk
-
weighted assets and capital in the Fixed Income 
business. At their peak, these risk
-
weighted assets were close to $500 
billion. And in the third quarter 2011, before the MBIA transaction, they 
were app
roximately $390 billion. This past summer, we laid out a series of 
RWA targets, including $280 billion at the end of 2013 and $255 billion at 
the end of 2014. As of the end of 2012, we have, in fact, reached our 2013 
targets as we exited the year at $280 b
illion.
 
Today, we're establishing lower targets for 2013 and 2014 and providing you 
with our 2016 target, which we believe will reflect end
-
state capital and risk
-
weighted asset levels in this business. The end state will be less than $200 
billion of RWAs,
 
down from $390 billion in the third quarter of 2011, and as 
a result, $18 billion or less of capital, down from $35 billion. Our targets 
reflect some reinvestment in areas that are important to our clients.
 
The RWA reductions largely represent runoff. We 
do not expect the 
reductions to impair revenues as we run them down. We are committed to 
having a full service Institutional Securities business, one that is increasingly 
integrated with our Wealth Management business. We need all 3 of our 
institutional bu
sinesses to be appropriately sized to service our clients.
 
As we have told you, we have been exiting products in areas which are not 
strategically rational from a client or franchise perspective. We continue to 
adapt our offerings and expect the business t
o continue to evolve as we 
have more regulatory certainty. We're confident with the steps we've taken 
to position Institutional Securities for the future.
 
The third major driver of higher returns is, of course, expenses. One of the 
things that is little un
derstood about Morgan Stanley is how much money 
we've been spending on our infrastructure since becoming a financial holding 
company. We've made great progress in regards to that spending and 
expect our compensation and non
-
compensation expenses to decline
 
beyond 
what we accomplished in 2012, assuming a flat revenue environment. The 
reductions will be augmented by the expense savings we have discussed 
with you in the past, as well as new initiatives we have recently undertaken 
and which I will now discuss t
oday.
 
On Slide 8, you can follow it where we laid out our best estimates for the net 
impact of our cost reduction plans over the next 2 years, assuming a flat 
revenue environment and flat markets. We expect that some of our actions 
should result in a $1.6 
billion decline from 2012 reported expenses to 2014 
full year expenses. This reduction is on top of the $500 million already 
recognized in 2012, reflecting some reinvestment in growth areas that more 
than offset by our efforts to take out costs.
 
An importa
nt driver of the cost reductions is the 6,000 heads we've taken 
out of the business in the last 12 months, thereby reducing significant fixed 
salary and benefit costs. Our expense reductions reflect multiple work 
streams. Prior to today, we've told you abo
ut our reengineering efforts, 
GWM cost actions and headcount reduction efforts. Some of those cost cuts, 
as I said, are already reflected in our numbers and more will be recognized 
over time.
 
However recently initiated, but as part of our ongoing geographi
c footprint 
review, we are reducing and resizing some of our international focus 
--
 
some 
of our international offices so that we can focus mainly on our institutional 
client coverage and advisory services. These moves enhance the importance 
of regional cen
ters such as New York, London and Hong Kong. Specifically, 
in Russia and the Middle East, we're downsizing our local presence in sales 
and trading, redeploying certain of those resources back to our regional 
centers. It allows us to cover our key clients i
n a more efficient manner while 
reducing middle office expenses.
 
In other parts of our network, in Europe and Asia, we've made decisions to 
streamline our footprint, defer expansion plans and exit certain parts of our 
business. These changes are part of an
 
ongoing evolution as a global 
institution to depend more on regional centers.
 
These changes drive efficiencies because functions can be executed more 
economically from the regional centers due to our centralized trading 
platforms, execution teams, infrast
ructure and support. For the purpose of 
this presentation, we're not counting on a recovery in revenues. If that 
happens, obviously, our variable expenses, for example, brokerage and 
clearing, would grow. However, our overall expense ratios should improve 
if 
revenues increase. We will continue to look for additional areas to reduce 
expenses and push beyond 2014.
 
The fourth driver of higher returns is growth, growth that is not market
-
dependent, that is unique to Morgan Stanley and in which we do have a high
 
degree of confidence. You're already aware of our focus on our market share 
in the institutional business, the interest rate and equity market sensitivity in 
Wealth Management, as well as the contractual upside associated with 
owning 100% of the Wealth Ma
nagement joint venture. However, today, we 
want to speak about 2 additional significant growth opportunities that will 
drive growth in both institutional and Wealth Management.
 
First, we believe there's revenue upside and expense savings for both ISG 
and W
ealth Management as we more closely align those businesses. They 
launched a joint effort in September 2012 to increase collaboration between 
the businesses. There are currently over 35 initiatives in various stages of 
execution, and we expect initial impac
t from this effort in 2013, with upside 
over the next 10 years 
--
 
next 3 years. We lay out those categories on Slide 
10, but let me give you a couple of examples.
 
We're consolidating some of our research efforts across the firm. We've 
moved some sales and 
trading management and product execution into 
Wealth Management. The opportunities in fixed income in particular are very 
compelling. Among several of those, we recently announced a middle 
markets fixed income platform. We moved several thousand fixed inco
me 
clients and a number of salespeople to Wealth Management to increase the 
intensity of the coverage of those clients and to free up capacity on the 
institutional side. We're already seeing some positive results. To improve 
operating efficiency, we believ
e opportunities exist to eliminate overlapping 
back
-
office trading support functions and enhance risk management.
 
Finally, in the organizational coordination category, we believe there's 
tremendous opportunity to integrate the senior relationship managemen
t 
effort into Wealth Management. Significant business partners for Wealth 
Management are very often top clients of the institutional business.
 
Second area of growth comes from execution of our bank strategy as we're 
now on a path of having approximately $1
40 billion in deposits. We've 
previously discussed opportunities in Wealth Management where we believe 
our lending product penetration is 500 basis points below our peers. 
However, there's also upside for Institutional Securities beyond lower 
funding costs
 
for lending, derivatives and other products. We believe there 
are substantial opportunities to expand in commercial lending, though 
consistent of course with our existing skill set and risk management 
capabilities.
 
Most importantly, let me now turn to ret
urns. Our focus is to drive higher 
returns for shareholders through sustainably improving our ROE to levels 
equal to or in excess of our cost of equity even without a cyclical recovery. 
Assuming no change in market conditions, normalizing for the CVA drag 
we 
saw this year, the Wealth Management buy
-
in and contractual upside, our 
expense initiatives and some progress towards our firm
-
specific growth 
initiatives, we believe we can reach ROEs of approximately 9% and ROTEs of 
11%. Returning excess capital would
 
get us to 10% levels on ROE and 12% 
on an ROTE basis. And obviously, an improved operating environment would 
drive upside beyond those numbers, respectively.
 
Regarding capital, we have unambiguously moved from a position of shoring 
up capital through pref
erred conversions and accreting capital through RWA 
reductions and earnings to a phase where we believe we're well capitalized. 
Over the next few years, we will build substantial incremental excess capital 
in addition to quarterly earnings accretion, drive
n by additional RWA 
reductions and reductions in capital in Merchant Banking and Real Estate, 
consistent with the Volcker Rule.
 
There is no question that we will return some of this capital. The question is 
when. Our very near
-
term focus is acquiring the b
alance of the Wealth 
Management joint venture. We'll reinvest some of the capital freed up from 
some of these opportunities that I've previously described, though the 
overwhelming amount will be returned to shareholders as soon as it's 
practical. As always
, all capital actions are subject to regulatory approval.
 
In closing, I want to emphasize that we're working aggressively to drive 
higher returns. We continue to augment our recent efforts with additional 
RWA reductions, increased expense savings, addition
al areas in which we 
are outright reducing optionality and new efforts to drive revenues higher 
that are unique to Morgan Stanley. I've also shared with you our thoughts 
on capital returns.
 
We've been making tough decisions as and when we have 
clarity in regards 
to capital, businesses and people, and we'll continue to do so as regulatory 
uncertainty lifts. I am confident that we're on a path to increasing 
shareholder value that will be evident regardless of the macro environment.
 
Investment bank
s play an important role in facilitating capital to meet client 
needs. We believe these needs will grow substantially over the next decade, 
and we will continue to be a leader. The leadership of this firm has never 
been more integrated in my time with Morg
an Stanley, and I'm very excited 
about our future.
 
Thank you. Let me pass it on to Ruth to talk about the fourth quarter.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the 
effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in
 
the footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures.
 
DVA in the quarter was a loss of $511 million, with $330 million in fixed 
income sales and trading and $181 million in equity sales and trading. 
Excluding the impact of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues were $7.5 billion, 
essentially flat to the third quarter.
 
Non
-
interest expense was $6.1 billion, down 10% versus the third quarter. 
Compensation expense was $3.6 billion this quarter, down 8% versus Q3. 
Non
-
compensation expense was $2.5 billi
on, down 13% from last quarter.
 
The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 
11.1%. In our tax line this quarter, we reversed certain tax reserves as a 
result of new information from IRS exams that resulted in a benefit of $
299 
million. In addition, we recorded an out
-
of
-
period net tax provision of $144 
million to adjust previously recorded deferred tax assets principally 
associated with partnership investments in the Asset Management segment. 
We are also reviewing the firm's
 
deferred tax accounts.
 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders were approximately $867 million. Earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share were $0.45 after preferred dividends. On a 
reported or GAAP 
basis, firm
-
wide revenues for the quarter were $7 billion.
 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders were $547 million. Reported earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share were $0.28 after preferred div
idends. Book 
value at the end of the quarter was $30.65 per share. Tangible book value 
was $26.81 per share. Included in the discontinued operations is $115 
million associated with the Saxon settlement.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $
782 billion at December 
31, up from $765 billion last quarter. Deposits were $83 billion versus $71 
billion at the end of the third quarter, driven primarily by retail investors 
moving to cash towards the end of the quarter and also by the deposits 
associa
ted with the 14% acquisition of the Wealth Management joint 
venture.
 
Our liquidity reserve was $182 billion at the end of the quarter, up $12 
billion versus last quarter. And as of January 16, our liquidity was $189 
billion. Although calculations are not f
inal, we believe that our Tier 1 
common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 14.7%, and our Tier 1 
capital ratio will be approximately 17.9%. Risk
-
weighted assets under Basel 
I are expected to be approximately $306 billion at December 31.
 
Subject to f
inal rule making and reflecting our best assessment of the rules, 
our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 9.5% as of the end 
of the fourth quarter.
 
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, 
revenues, excluding 
DVA, were $3.5 billion, down 5% sequentially. Non
-
interest expense was $2.9 billion, down 12% versus the third quarter.
 
Compensation was $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting a 43% ratio, 
excluding DVA. Non
-
compensation expense of $1.4 billion de
creased 15% 
from last quarter. The business reported a pretax profit of $568 million, 
excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, the business 
reported a pretax profit of $57 million.
 
In investment banking, revenues of $1.2 billion were up 26
% versus last 
quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in global 
IPOs, #2 in global announced M&A, #2 in global equity and #4 in U.S. dollar 
investment
-
grade debt at the end of the fourth quarter. Notable transactions 
included: in eq
uity underwriting, the $733 million IPO of Workday, which 
was the largest tech IPO since May; in advisory, we acted as lead strategic 
advisor to ICE on the $8.2 billion definitive agreement to acquire NYSE 
Euronext; and in debt underwriting, the AbbVie spi
n financing, including a 
$14.7 billion in bonds and $7.5 billion event loan and a $4.9 billion tender, 
the largest U.S. dollar investment
-
grade offering ever.
 
Advisory revenues of $454 million were up 34% versus the third quarter, 
driven by increased reven
ues in the Americas. Equity underwriting revenues 
were $237 million, a 19% increase from the third quarter, reflecting 
increased revenues in EMEA and the Americas.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $534 million were up 24% versus 
last quarter and were 
our highest reported revenues, reflecting increases in 
investment
-
grade bond issuance and loan syndication fees.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.27 billion, an 
increase of 4% from last quarter. Derivatives had the strongest fourth
 
quarter since 2008, reflecting increased market activity and strength across 
regions.
 
Prime brokerage revenues were consistent with the third quarter as average 
client balances increased moderately. Revenues and cash equities were up 
slightly, driven by h
igher market volumes in the Americas and Asia.
 
Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, 
were $811 million. Revenues decreased versus our third quarter results as 
commodities experienced meaningfully lower revenues and a diffi
cult 
market. CVA, net of hedges, continued to be a drag this quarter due in part 
to the tightening of our credit spreads.
 
Less favorable market conditions drove lower rates revenues. However, 
client volumes held up relatively well across businesses in the 
quarter, and 
results also reflect growth in the credit corporate business. Other sales and 
trading reflects negative revenues of $35 million compared with negative 
revenues of $162 million last quarter.
 
Turning to VAR. In our supplement, we provided VAR me
asures under both 
our current and previous VAR model for this quarter, the prior quarter and 
the prior year. Average trading VAR for the fourth quarter was $78 million 
versus $63 million in the third quarter.
 
Turning to Global Wealth Management. Revenues o
f $3.5 billion were up 4% 
compared to the prior quarter. Asset Management revenues were up, 
reflecting higher managed money balances. Transaction revenues increased 
4% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $579 million, 
which increased 
11%, reflecting higher activity levels by retail investors as 
they partially reallocated from securities into cash; investment banking
-
related fees of $209 million, which increased 5% versus last quarter, driven 
by closed
-
end fund activity; and trading rev
enues of $288 million, which 
were down 8% versus the third quarter, reflecting markdowns in our 
deferred compensation plans.
 
Non
-
interest expense was $2.9 billion, down 7% from last quarter. The 
compensation ratio was 57% versus 61% in the third quarter, r
eflecting 
year
-
end true ups. Non
-
compensation expense was $901 million, down 14% 
versus last quarter, reflecting the absence of non
-
recurring items reported in 
3Q. The PBT margin was 17%, a record since the inception of the joint 
venture. We reported profi
t before tax of $581 million in the fourth quarter.
 
Total client assets were flat at $1.8 trillion, primarily reflecting the minimal 
impact of market conditions on asset levels and positive flows. Global fee
-
based asset inflows were $4 billion. Fee
-
based a
ssets under management 
increased to $573 billion at quarter end. Global representatives were 
16,780, consistent with the third quarter. Bank deposits were $131 billion, 
with approximately $72 billion held in Morgan Stanley banks.
 
Asset Management revenues 
of $599 million were down from $631 million in 
the third quarter due primarily to lower merchant banking principal 
investment gains. In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of $376 
million were flat to the third quarter. In Real Estate Investing, revenue
s of 
$127 million were up versus last quarter. Due to the ownership structure of 
these funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third
-
party 
investors in the Non
-
controlling Interest line.
 
In Merchant Banking, revenues were $96 million compared w
ith $134 million 
in the third quarter, driven primarily by lower principal investment gains. 
Compensation expense was $168 million in the quarter, down from $241 
million in the third quarter. Profit before tax was $221 million, up from $198 
million last qu
arter. NCI was $49 million versus $50 million last quarter. 
Total assets under management increased to $338 billion, driven by net 
inflows of $1 billion and market appreciation.
 
Let me end with a brief summary of our outlook. In Investment Banking, the 
advisory pipeline is healthy. Equity underwriting is increasing after a very 
muted 2012. Although fixed income underwriting reached a record level for 
us in the fourth quarter, it is important to note that the strength of 
underwriting was achieved with onl
y modest acquisition finance, which 
suggests that activity can remain strong, especially if advisory picks up. 
Sales and trading activity should benefit from ongoing global healing, most 
notably in Europe and Asia.
 
And with respect to Wealth Management, we
 
are pleased with the ongoing 
momentum in the business, with profitability reflecting the benefit of being 
on one platform, although keep in mind that the first quarter has seasonally 
higher compensation expense and 2 fewer trading days.
 
Thank you for list
ening, and James and I will now take your questions.

environment is a really strong statement and a helpful benchmark for us. 
I'm curious, James, how do you broadly think about the incremental margins 
or returns in a potentially better revenue environment? For
 
example, if 
revenues were up 10% with a similar business mix, how much do you think 
would drop to the bottom line?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Boy, that's not one I'm going to wing. Look, maybe put pencil to paper. 
We've been operating so much under the basis that th
ere won't be increased 
revenues. Obviously, the world is going to evolve, so at some point, that's 
not true. But our approach is being what can we control? How do we drive 
up margins in a flat revenue environment? And obviously, through the 
expense line is
 
how we're doing that. By definition, if we hold the line on our 
fixed costs, which I think we've been very disciplined about on a go
-
forward 
basis, one would assume the incremental dollar revenue would throw off a 
higher incremental margin than the previo
us dollar revenue. But I got to go 
on 
--
 
we'd have to go and look at it business by business.
 
Howard Chen

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
And we saw some really nice expense control within Global Wealth 
Management. Specific to compensation, you've no
ted in the past the limited 
flexibility you might have due to the grid
-
like comp structure. So I'm 
curious, what's driving that comp accrual lower in 2012? And how 
sustainable should we think of that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The main driver of the reduction in the comp
 
ratio is the fact that we are 
done with integration. As we've talked about on so many calls over the 
years, the integration expense was running ballpark $80 million to $100 
million a quarter until we completed the integration at the end of the second 
quar
ter then dropped down in the third and fourth quarter, taper down. 
That's one major benefit. The second is that as a result of being on one 
platform, we're able to consolidate a number of back offices and 
management layers, the items that we outlined reall
y on the third quarter 
call. And so that's sustainable as well. I think the fourth quarter 
compensation benefited a bit by what is typical year
-
end true up, true down. 
Sometimes it benefits the comp ratio, other times, it doesn't. I think it's fair 
to say 
near term, the ratio is likely to be in the 60% range. But very much 
to your point, there really 
--
 
there are a couple of drivers that will reduce 
that comp ratio more. One is as we're continuing to build out the lending 
product, the lending product is a n
on
-
compensable revenue. It does provide 
a lift to the margin and drives 
--
 
that alone drives the margin into the 50s. 
And then, again, a better operating environment. In particular, any kind of 
rate increase has a meaningful benefit to the margin in the bu
siness, and 
that helps as well. So we're good at where we are here, holds you kind of in 
the first quarter near term to that 15% margin for the reasons I described, 
with upside.

And then just finally for me
, can you discuss your wholesale funding plans 
over the next 2 years? I think you have maybe $45 billion
-
ish maturing 
through 2014. How much would you like rolled off, and how do you think 
that funding schedule potentially change as you buy in the rest of 
the JV this 
year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. There are a couple of variables to that. We're obviously sitting here, as 
I noted, with liquidity at higher levels, about $189 billion. So there's some 
flex in there. We have reduced outstanding indebtedness, outstanding 
debt 
this year, unsecured debt by about $19 billion, very much to your point 
about the changing composition of the balance sheet. And then as we buy in 
the balance of the wealth management business, the deposits, as I think you 
know, come on, we'll get abo
ut $15 billion when we complete the 35%, but 
the balance of it comes on ratably over a 2
-
year period of time. The total 
size of those deposits is ballpark $140 billion, part of which will be used to 
support growth in the institutional business. So the 3 co
mponents of it will 
be wealth management lending, institutional lending and other bank
-
appropriate businesses moving into the bank. As we do that, we get dollar
-
for
-
dollar substitution, reducing unsecured debt requirements and replacing 
them with deposit f
unding. So all of those provides a bit of flexibility with 
respect to the magnitude of unsecured debt or wholesale funding that will be 
required on a go
-
forward basis.

The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.

So I appreciate the further detail on the RWA wind
-
down. I guess a 2
-
part 
question is I'm assuming that it's all passive, but if you look at it, what it 
does imply, and you guys are by no means alone here, there's $
80 billion of 
RWA that are clogging up the system that have no real revenue impact. So 
the 2
-
parter is, one, can anything in the market conditions change that to 
make there be a positive or a negative revenue impact? Or are we kind of 
locked and loaded and
 
just waiting for wind
-
down? And part 2 is what does 
that RWA wind
-
down plan imply at all? Does it have revenue implications for 
fixed income as that plays out?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So Glenn, when we put out the initial forecast for risk
-
weighted assets and 
RWA redu
ction, we were looking at 
--
 
there are obviously 3 levels 
--
 
levers. 
There's passive mitigation, active mitigation and model approval. And the 
guidance last summer was primarily based on passive mitigation, just 
scheduled roll
-
offs to maturity sub
-
position
s [ph]. I've had some active, but 
it was primarily passive. What we've done through the back half of 2012 was 
accomplished through active mitigation. In other words, we pulled forward 
some of the passive mitigation that was embedded in that earlier forecas
t, 
but it was through active mitigation that we ended the year at $280 billion of 
risk
-
weighted assets and were able to pull forward our forecast by a year. 
And the way we've been accomplishing the active mitigation is, really, with 
minimal P&L impact, and
 
that's the way we're continuing to look at it. We're 
really reducing capital behind positions that are 
--
 
in areas that are not 
revenue
-
accretive longer term.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
So just making sure I got it right,
 
any way you slice it, as the RWA runoff, 
good or bad market conditions, it's going to have no revenue impact.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I said it's minimal revenue impact. That's the way we've been looking at it. 
And I think you had one other part of your question I did
n't quite address. 
The reason we've been able to accomplish this pull
-
forward is this is, as you 
know, a real priority for us. We have strict governance around it. Our senior 
leadership team is very committed to it, and that's enabled us to pull 
forward, t
hrough active mitigation, more reduction in 2012 and set us up for 
this decline as we're looking at in '13 and beyond, at minimal P&L impact.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Got it. Ruth, you've mentioned the 43% true comp 
ratio at ISG. I'm 
assuming that was the year, not the quarter, correct?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Correct.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Okay. And that's come down and I think the shareholders be cool with that. 
We've seen some stuff in the
 
press about changes on the deferral. Not 
something normally I'd ask you to comment on, but I'm just curious on the 
impact on future periods. So the change in deferred, I've seen this happen in 
the past at some other companies. How much of a contingent lia
bility does 
that create on the go
-
forward? Or is it not material to the overall story?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, a couple of things in terms of the compensation structure. So we did 
change the comp structure again this year. We raised the total compensation 
level a
t which deferrals start, so over 82% of people don't have deferrals, 
and it's really 
--
 
think of it as those who are in the earlier parts of their 
careers. So it's really for the more senior people that we have deferrals. The 
vesting schedule is still over
 
3 years, and it's the combination of cash and 
equity, which we think further enhances alignments of interest. But as we 
talked about on calls last year, we said the absolute amount of deferrals 
would be going down. It is continuing to go down. The actual 
amount of 
deferrals in 2013 is lower than 2012, and the aggregate amount continues to 
decline. And I think as important, as James noted in his comments, when 
you combine that with the actions we've taken reducing headcount, base 
and benefits are also meani
ngfully lower. We're paying 6,000 fewer people 
in 2013. And then you add that to things like location sourcing. So kind of 
that fixed element of it, if that's where you framed it, is declining.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
N
ow that's super helpful. And then last one for me, commodities, 
specifically, and I appreciate the environment has been a soft one, and I've 
seen it everywhere. Is the business actually changed such that maybe it 
doesn't fit inside a broker
-
dealer anymore?
 
In other words, would private 
equity be a better owner? It seems 
--
 
curious if you would allocate, I'm sure 
you won't, but I'll try, the risk
-
weighted assets associated with it? It feels 
like, wow, 3 out of 4 quarters this year were pretty soft. In other 
words, in 
your mind, is it cyclical versus something changed?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, there were some quite specific issues in the environment that affected 
commodities this quarter, in particular. I mean, as you know well, our 
business is both physical and tradin
g, and it's also primarily oil and power. 
And when you combine storm
-
related dislocation, continued backwardation 
with lower prices affecting our storage business and then the lower volatility, 
we had a series of things that resulted in, basically, de mini
mis revenues in 
commodities this quarter, very unusual one over time. So we do think 
there's quite a cyclical element to it, storm
-
related element to it, however 
you want to frame it.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Yes, I'd just add firstly, to put the quarter in context
, and I know the second 
quarter was also challenging, you have to go back to 1995, I think, to find 
quarters like that. So it was fairly aberrant. These businesses don't turn that 
quickly on a dime, good or bad. We have a tremendous Commodities 
business, t
remendous team. They had an aberrant environment, difficult 
environment, difficult quarter, and we moved on past that. On the broader 
strategic things, I mean, if we could find a structure that was more 
advantageous for everybody, we'd do that, and obvious
ly, as we've said 
publicly, we're open to that. But this is not because we don't think it's a 
great business. We're just constantly looking at the combination of capital, 
liquidity, funding and the mix of those 3 things and trying to figure out the 
best wa
y to move forward.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
 
Michael Mayo

CLSA Asia

Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
I think this goes in the category of good progress but could it be better. So 
starting with Slide 12, you identify
 
targets for return on tangible equity at 
11%, going to 12% at some point, but you don't put a time frame around 
that. Can you give us any better sense of timing when you expect to achieve 
that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
What we tried to do, Mike, was lay out in the deck
 
the key components that 
are embedded in that 9%, so the expense initiatives, the capital efficiency, 
the drivers in wealth management and Institutional Securities. So just 
focusing on the expense 
--
 
well, let's start from the top. Wealth initiative and 
th
e buy
-
in there, as James said, that's one item that we put into CCAR. 
That's with a focus to accomplish as soon as possible, subject to regulatory 
approval. And the benefit, to be clear, of the wealth management buy
-
in is 
not just the incremental 35% earni
ngs but the contractual upside once we 
own 100% results in earnings that are about the same as that which we get 
from retaining the NCI. And then on top of that, when you're talking about 
ROE, clearly, as I've been talking about for many quarters, we've be
en 
holding capital against the stake. So that's deadweight capital. We'll finally 
get not just the NCI but that contractual earnings against it. That's helpful 
and that's submitted within our CCAR now. The expense initiatives, as we 
outlined on the chart, 
are over the next 2 years. And so you can see the 
$1.6 billion reduction in the 2
-
year period of time. I think the RWA 
reductions, we're continuing to focus on that near term and the growth 
initiatives as well. So we're not putting a specific timeline on i
t, but try to 
guide you there with the way we laid out the other key drivers of the upside.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA Asia
-
Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
And for the expense reduction, now that is a big number, $1.6 billion, but 
you've made such good progres
s here recently that if you annualize fourth 
quarter results, I guess that's just $400 million incremental per year. Am I 
doing the math correctly, or how should I think about that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, the reason we pulled it all together in $1.6 billion, as 
we've been 
talking to you over the last year or 2 about a number of different initiatives, 
the Office of Re
-
engineering, the wealth management efforts, the headcount 
reduction, so the goal was to pull everything together with a holistic view of 
it. As it r
elates to reengineering, which is both comp and non
-
comp, we 
targeted a $1.4 billion run rate reduction by 2014 and a $500 million run 
rate reduction by the end of 2012. Our expenses in aggregate are down 
$500 million between 2011 and 2012, a little differ
ent mix there but down 
by that $500 million. So now when you layer on top of it the integration in 
wealth management, the benefit from the consolidation steps, the headcount 
reduction, line by line buildup takes you to that $1.6 billion over the 2
-
year 
per
iod of time. So I wouldn't say annualize the 2011 over 2012 reduction. 
This is really by initiative, takes you to the $1.6 billion over that period of 
time based on our best estimates, what we know now and, as we said, 
assuming a flat revenue environment.
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA Asia
-
Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
And the wealth management margin, great, you're 17%, but I guess your 
target is still mid
-
teens. So why not increase the targets?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We're keeping it for now at the mid
-
teens target, and w
e're pleased with the 
17% and all that we had to do with the franchise completing the integration 
that set us up to achieve the 17% margin. But as I said previously, we 
wouldn't guide you to hold that 17% in the first quarter for a couple of 
reasons. One, 
there are fewer trading days, and it is seasonally slightly 
higher comp ratio. So holding the comp ratio, at least near term, in that 
60% range, implying sort of a 15
-
ish percent margin near term, we think, is 
prudent, appropriate. But again, for the reaso
ns we've talked about, namely 
the expense savings through consolidation, coupled with the upside we see 
with our growth in lending, that should take you to higher levels. And if you 
have any lift at all from the environment, in particular, on the rate side
, it 
does as well. But we're going to hold for now to the mid
-
teens and wait to 
see those play out over time.
 
Michael Mayo

CLSA Asia

Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
And then lastly, backlogs, you said equity underwriting is higher. Is that link 
quarter, year
-
over
-
year or both? And can you also give those 
--
 
that 
information for total investment banking?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the equity pipeline is up going into the year, so quarter
-
over
-
quarter, and 
as I said, it's driven by greater activity in Europe an
d Asia, in particular. 
Those were pretty muted throughout 2012. So with the healthier backdrop, 
in particular, in Europe, we're looking for more activity. And then 
--
 
I'm 
sorry, the second part of your question was...
 
Michael Mayo 
-
 
CLSA Asia
-
Pacific Marke
ts, Research Division
 
Just backlogs, any other color you can give. So that's equity. What about 
fixed income?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Fixed income tends to have a slightly shorter pipeline. It has been a very 
constructive environment for refinancing. I think there have
 
been some 
debate as to was activity pulled into the fourth quarter from the first 
quarter. Our view very much is it was not. This was just good refinancing 
effort and corporate clients being opportunistic because of low rates, and so 
there is more to come
. We think that although you never want to forecast an 
extension off of a record quarter, the offset to any kind of declines there. In 
fact, the M&A market remains as constructive as it appears we could see 
some more event lending activity, in particular, 
non investment
-
grade 
activity. So I don't want to suggest that you should extrapolate off of the 
fourth quarter, given it was a record, but we feel good about the ongoing 
interest by clients in financing activity.

The next question will come from 
Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Quick question here. The roughly $50 billion of RWA reduction that we're 
going from current to year
-
end '14, have you guys provided the risk weights 
for those assets? And if n
ot, would you do so?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We have not. We thought we were actually being quite expansive breaking 
out the risk weights by category. We've given you some of the product 
areas, but we have not broken it out more than that.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investme
nt Bank, Research Division
 
Okay. And then I assume in the run
-
off that you guys had, even though you 
had some opportunistic active runoff here this quarter, that the forward look 
is still all passive. Is that right?
 
Ruth Porat
 
It's overwhelmingly passive, 
just as we built up the first forecast. And I think 
one of the potentially obvious points is given the focus in governance around 
RWA reduction, we were able to pull forward and execute. And again, there's 
only so many times you can pull things forward. Bu
t this is primarily passive 
mitigation at this point with a focus on trying to continue to accelerate some 
of the active.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay. And I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you or have you quantified the 
r
evenue opportunity that's in the order flow capture once you guys own all 
of MSSB?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We haven't broken out the order flow agreement separately, but when you 
take the order flow agreement, the return on higher deposits, very 
importantly, assuming t
hat those additional deposits, near term, merely 
fund the AFS portfolio and the reduction of the expenses associated with 
running a joint venture like extra reporting and other items like that, those 3 
items in the aggregate are about comparable to the ear
nings from the 35%. 
And again, a couple of items. One, that's, again, assuming that if we're just 
putting that into an AFS portfolio, clearly, as we're lending it out there, it's 
greater returns. And that's the key point.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Ba
nk, Research Division
 
Sure. So as we're modeling this, a check figure would be maybe to watch 
the 
--
 
take a look at the NCI and double it effectively. And then as along as 
we're getting that kind of upside, then we're in the right ballpark.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.
 
I think one thing you probably want to look at is the slide that James 
walked you through. We indicated that the incremental capital, ballpark 
$400 million, and that the earnings in the first year, ballpark the same 
number. So we're kind of helping you tr
iangulate right back to those 
--
 
how 
much that will bring.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. And then just last one for me. On the wealth 
management business, can you give some color around risk appetite 
and 
what you guys are seeing around all this noise out of D.C.? Is it impacting 
risk appetites there? Are you starting to see a little relief now that we've 
moved past some of it or at least people might realize that noise and all that 
out of D.C. are just
 
a permanent part of the landscape at this point?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Let me take a cut at that because I've been pretty involved with some of the 
stuff going on in the fiscal side and trying to get the temperature of the 
retail investor. I would say that 
somewhere around early December, there 
was a shift in tone and a pickup in activity and by definition, a pickup in risk 
appetite. So investors were re
-
engaging. Businesses of this size and this 
geographic dispersity don't move dramatically month to month, 
but there 
was definitely a tonal shift. I think it's too early, obviously, in this quarter to 
say much about that. But it feels similar, and the more progress that we 
have on the fiscal front, the more confidence investors will have to get out 
there and in
vest. The other thing you have to look at, Brennan, is that the 
401(k) plans are up materially last year, so the wealth impact of people is 
up materially. They get to the end of the year, they see their 401(k) holding 
is up, on average, equity side, up 15%
. That has a real driving factor around 
investment behavior. So I think we 
--
 
my personal view is that absent a 
reversal in the U.S. economy, which I don't anticipate, or a complete mess 
up in Washington, which I don't anticipate because they're making pro
gress, 
I think we've passed the bottom.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Well, you can never not count on a complete mess up out of Washington.

The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous 
Research.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
On the lending in Global Wealth Management, do you have a target loan
-
to
-
deposit ratio that you'd like to move towards?
 
Ruth Porat
 
At this point, we don't. I think the main point to note is we do have the 
largest retail distribution system. And as James noted, we think there's real 
upside because only 5% of our clients are currently using our lending suite. 
It's ballpark 10% for our peers, and that's just because historically, this 
hasn't been a strategic f
ocus for us. So our deposits will be growing to about 
$140 billion post
-
acquisition. We think we have real meaningful upside 
there. It wouldn't be fully utilized just on the wealth management side, at 
least in the very near term. We're continuing to be qui
te prudent about the 
way we're growing that portfolio. And that's why when we talk about deposit 
growth, it's not just with respect to wealth management, but it's also what 
we're doing on the institutional side with relationship lending and event 
lending a
nd with additional products moving into the bank, bank
-
appropriate 
products such as things like commercial real estate lending or asset
-
based 
lending with our existing corporate clients.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
Fair enough. On your Slide 7
, James, on the FICC discussion, the RWA net 
reduction of $30 billion through sort of the net of strategic reductions and 
growth, is there any way that we can get under that just to see how you're 
thinking about how you would shift emphasis on the business
 
within FICC?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The focus within FICC is very consistent with what we've been talking about 
for quite some time. And so there are areas of growth within those core 
product areas we're continuing to be active in rates and have invested in it 
at for
eign exchange. Similarly, we're continuing to benefit from the 
electronic trading platform. In fact, we set new records internally for trade 
volumes last quarter. Credit remains important to us. We're very active in 
mortgages. So it continues to be in the 
areas that we've spoken about, and 
we just wanted to leave some cushion for ongoing growth there, which is 
part of the plan.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
Sure, that's helpful. On Page 12 of the slides, can you give us a sense for 
how much of ge
tting to that 9% ROE with no change in market conditions 
would be contingent on getting to the FICC market share targets that you've 
laid out in the past?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We've tried to give as many levers as we can. We are still committed to the 
market share g
ains, the 2% market share gains that we've talked about. 
We're also very focused on the returns in the business, and you can see that 
with what we've done on RWA reduction, but I haven't broken that out.
 
James P. Gorman
 
Yes, but it sounds like fundamentall
y, you did assume in that analysis that 
you did gain those couple of points of share.
 
Ruth Porat
 
No, because what we have here as first bullet is 
--
 
no change in market 
conditions, is essentially just a flat revenue environment and then layer in 
the action
s that we've put into this slide deck here.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
Okay. So you don't assume that you have any meaningful share gain within 
the context of the flat market? I just want to make sure I understand what 
your assumptions are.
 
R
uth Porat
 
Yes. We have 2 
--
 
let me be very clear here. For purposes of the slide and 
the 9%, we've delineated the steps that we're taking, assuming no change 
in market condition. For purposes of the way we're running the business and 
the way our business l
eaders think about the business, of course, we're 
continuing to pursue the market share gains for all the reasons that we've 
talked about. I was answering 2 questions, I apologize.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research LLP
 
No, but now it's clear. That helps
 
a lot. And then finally, just not to harp on 
this margin target on GWM, but it almost sounds like you want to raise the 
target there, except that you don't want to do that in the face of some 
seasonality in the first quarter on the expense base, and I und
erstand that. 
But should we be thinking that it goes up, that the target goes up beyond 
the first quarter?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Let me have a go at this. I mean, listen. Firstly, one quarter is 13 weeks. So 
let's not get too wound up about precisely where we 
are. As Ruth said, 
there's some seasonality. We were criticized in the past for laying out a 20% 
margin 4 years ago for this business. We didn't anticipate a very difficult 
market. We didn't anticipate 0 interest rates, and we're guilty as charged. So 
we s
aid we would deliver in this business mid

next year, and that's what we're focused on. So let's revisit it, Guy, when we 
get to the mid

teen margins in the middle of next year.

The final question will come from Fiona

I just wanted to ask on your Basel III capital ratio and what you think your 
target is now post 
--
 
do you think 
--
 
I noticed somewhere there was a 9% 
yield to 
investment bank in the capital allocation on the risk
-
weighted assets 
side. And then secondly, just within your Slide 12, when you talked about 
1% accretion from returning excess capital, I mean, that seems quite low. Is 
that just in 1 year, or could you j
ust talk a bit more about that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Certainly. So we're assuming that we'll run at a buffer above the 
requirements. So with our GCP buffer, that would put us at about 8.5%, run 
at a buffer above that. We're obviously looking to continue to accrete c
apital 
which will take those ratios up, in particular, with what we're doing on the 
RWA reduction side. And then the question really becomes over what time 
do we 
--
 
are we returning capital, and that's a function of earnings in the 
regulatory environment. 
And it's also how do we look to reinvest some of 
that capital in our business. I mean, there's some pretty obvious areas with 
$140 billion of deposits coming on and the opportunity to grow the suite of 
lending products, as I've talked about, both wealth ma
nagement and 
institutional. Some of it goes behind that. But we have not laid out a timeline 
for the return of capital, and we'll leave it to you to model in how much 
upside, incremental upside there is over what period of time returning 
excess capital.
 
We
ll, with that, we thank you very much for joining our fourth quarter call 
and look forward to speaking to you in 13 weeks.

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. 
Over the last 
several years we have focused on a number of things. Firstly, 
taking actions necessary to fix the obvious and immediate problems that we 
faced, secondly putting a strategy in place, the right strategy which was 
focused on a balanced business with more effe
ctive risk controls, and thirdly, 
meaningfully investing in our culture to ensure we remain an important 
choice for top talent and manage our business with professionalism with 
whatever challenges we face.
 
These strategic choices were designed to ensure th
at as much as we can 
control, the firm does well in a strong market environment and 
demonstrates stability in a seasonally or structurally more difficult one and 
that is exactly how 2018 is shaping up. The first half of the year was 
characterized by strong
 
market environment and increased levels of client 
activity. Commensurate with that backdrop we delivered returns above the 
top end of the ROE target range of 10% to 13% of that first half period.
 
The third quarter of course was impacted by the traditional
 
summer 
slowdown and a more fragile trading environment. Even so, we delivered an 
ROE of 11.5% and an ROTCE of 13.2%. These are comfortably within our 
target ranges and firm revenues of $9.9 billion. In prior periods through 
2008 when we delivered revenues
 
of $9 billion to $10 billion we had a 
leverage ratio of 30 to 40 times. Obviously, we have dramatically changed 
the way we conduct our business.
 
What was most pleasing in Q3 was the stability across the whole franchise. 
Though we can clearly have aberrati
ons in any one quarter, we believe that 
we have set a floor while at the same time created significant upside 
potentials. Investing in our talent and building out our leadership team is an 
essential ingredient to what we see as an exciting path forward. Ou
r ability 
to attract talent from across the street, relatively low attrition levels, and 
high employee satisfaction are all hard evidence of the strong culture. Our 
challenge is to make sure this endures not the weeks, months or even years, 
but for decades
 
to come.
 
With Q3 now behind us we look forward to spending more time discussing 
growth opportunities in the months and years ahead. In the meantime, we 
remain confident and optimistic about the near
-
term prospects with a strong 
finish through 2018.
 
I'll n
ow turn it over to Jon who will discuss the quarter in detail.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you and good morning. The results in the third quarter demonstrated 
strengths despite the typical summer slowdown. Our performance illustrates 
the resiliency of our busine
ss model and the ability to perform across an 
array of market environments. We reported revenues of $9.9 billion and PBT 
of $2.9 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.17, ROE was 11.5% and ROTCE was 
13.2%.
 
Institutional securities performed well. Investment banking 
benefited from 
continued strategic activity and new capital formation globally. Compared to 
historical third quarters equity's results were strong. Fixed income showed 
stability despite seasonally slower client flows and a lack of larger 
transactions. Weal
th management delivered another solid quarter and 
investment management saw continued positive long term net flows 
although investment results were impacted by weaker emerging markets.
 
We continue to benefit from the inherent operating leverage of our busi
ness 
model. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, our efficiency ratio was 70% and almost 
200 basis point improvement compared to the same period last year. 
Increased expenses have primarily been driven by higher compensation and 
execution related costs associated with
 
the higher revenues.
 
Our discipline around discretionary spending has allowed us to continue to 
make investments across the firm especially in technology. Although we 
typically see a seasonal increase in expenses in the fourth quarter, we 
remain confident
 
we will hit our full year efficiency ratio target.
 
Now to the businesses, institutional securities generated revenues of $4.9 
billion in the third quarter. Year
-
to
-
date revenues of $16.7 billion are up 
17% versus the same period last year benefiting from 
active global markets, 
increasing revenue pools and stable to improving wallet share. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, an 8% sequential 
decrease, driven primarily by lower execution related expenses and 
compensation expenses wer
e $1.6 billion, bringing the year
-
to
-
date 
compensation to net revenue ratio revenue to 34.5%.
 
Investment banking reported revenues of $1.5 billion down 14% relative to 
the second quarter reflecting a normal seasonal slowdown in activity. 
Notably this is ou
r best third quarter in over a decade contributing to our 
record year
-
to
-
date revenues. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $510 
million. M&A volumes remained at historically high levels supported by larger 
strategic transactions and cross border activi
ty. Pipelines remained healthy 
and dialogues are active.
 
New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter supporting 
strong underwriting results. Equity underwriting revenues were $441 million. 
Activity remained healthy across products and reg
ions with particular 
strength in IPOs. Americas were strong throughout the quarter while Asia 
and Europe saw some seasonal slowdown in August before a strong 
September.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues were $508 million. Increased results in 
investment g
rade issuance partially offset a slowdown in high yield financing 
relative to a very active second quarter. Event driven transactions remain a 
significant driver supported by the active M&A backdrop and our ability to 
leverage our global franchise to provi
de holistic client solutions.
 
Investment banking pipelines remained constructive across products and 
regions. For the remainder of the year strategic activity should support both 
our advisory and underwriting businesses. Of course client activity could be 
affected by continued or new macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. 
In addition, protracted periods of heightened volatility may impact issuers 
financing plans.
 
In Equity Sales and trading, we retained our leadership position and expect 
to be number
 
one globally. Revenues were $2 billion down 18% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Sequential revenues declined across each business line as the 
quarter was characterized by low market volumes and more subdued 
volatility compared to the first half of the year. Still, 
activity remained robust 
across products relative to historical third quarters particularly in Europe and 
Asia. Prime brokerage had a strong quarter benefiting from our investment 
in our global client footprint and derivative results were also strong aided
 
by 
a diversified product set and client mix.
 
Fixed income revenues of $1.2 billion were down 15% versus the second 
quarter. Seasonality and low rate volatility in the quarter impacted Europe in 
particular which contributed to the sequential decline. Overa
ll, revenues 
remained solid and are up 8% year
-
to
-
date. In our macro business we saw 
strong client activity in FX, supported in part by idiosyncratic events across 
emerging markets. Rate was negatively impacted by range
-
bound yields and 
low volatility glob
ally.
 
Our credit business saw a sequential decline on lower client activity across 
product areas. Our institutional lending franchise continues to demonstrate 
good balance sheet velocity. In commodities revenues were up as client 
activity remained robust. 
The results were supported by macro movements 
within the energy complex. The fixed income results reinforced that this 
business is well
-
positioned. Despite seasonal headwinds this quarter our 
revenues remained solid.
 
Turning to wealth management, organic g
rowth drivers of the business 
remained strong. In the quarter we saw net fee
-
based inflows, higher fee
-
based assets, and a continued increase in lending balances. The growth in 
these metrics supported higher asset management and net interest revenues 
contr
ibuting to the 2% sequential increase of total quarterly revenues of 
$4.4 billion. The business continues to demonstrate significant operating 
leverage. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, revenues of $13.1 billion are up 5%. Non
-
compensation expenses were up only 1%
 
over the same period and total 
non
-
interest expenses are up 3% resulting in PBD growth of 11%. In the 
quarter the margin exceeded 27%.
 
Total client assets of $2.5 trillion is up $85 billion or 4% compared to last 
quarter as markets showed gains and client
s continued to add new money to 
their accounts. Net fee
-
based flows also remained strong at $16 billion 
contributing to 3% growth in fee
-
based assets which now stand at $1.1 
trillion or 45% of total client assets. This quarter represents the 12th 
consecuti
ve quarter of fee
-
based assets growth.
 
Asset management revenues for the quarter were $2.6 billion up 2% on the 
higher asset levels. Net interest income was $1.1 billion for the quarter up 
3% sequentially. Higher NII was primarily driven by increased earni
ng assets 
as higher asset yields were offset by higher funding costs. This includes the 
impact of the cash sweep program redesign.
 
Wealth lending in the U.S. banks grew by $1.1 billion to $71.1 billion with 
increases across each major product line. Year
-
ov
er
-
year loan growth stands 
at approximately 7%. While the transition to our in
-
house mortgage 
platform impacted production earlier this year, we are currently in line with 
pre
-
conversion levels. We saw growth in the mortgage portfolio for the first 
time si
nce this transition.
 
In addition to the traditional decline in retail engagement during the summer 
months, we saw clients continue to focus more of their fixed income 
investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates. 
However, due to the i
mpact of positive mark
-
to
-
market on deferred 
compensation plans total transaction of revenues of $698 million remained 
essentially unchanged. It is worth noting that the contribution of 
transactional revenues have steadily declined. On a year
-
to
-
date basis
 
transactional revenues represent approximately 16% of total net revenues 
versus 22% in the same period three years ago.
 
This quarter's results once again demonstrate the stability and health of our 
wealth business. Segment revenues grew supported by annui
tized revenue 
drivers and pretax profit reached new highs. Year
-
to
-
date results 
demonstrate that we can steadily grow this business while continuing to 
make investments into tools to support asset growth, increase client 
engagement, and improve cost effici
encies.
 
In investment management, we saw continued positive long
-
term flows $3 
billion in the quarter supported by strength in overseas distribution. Total 
net revenues were $653 million, a 5% decline relative to last quarter. Asset 
management fees of 
$604 million were essentially flat sequentially. The 
increased fees on higher average long
-
term AUM were offset by lower feels 
and liquidity primarily driven by the wealth management cash sweep 
redesign.
 
Our overall fee rate in this business remained stabl
e. On a year
-
to
-
date 
basis, asset management revenues are up 13% on strong investment 
performance and positive flows particularly in our active fundamental equity 
strategies. Investment revenues were $40 million down 27% sequentially 
impacted by continued 
market volatility in FX and emerging market equity 
performance. Overall expenses of $551 million were essentially unchanged.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis total spot assets of $866 
billion are down $10 billion. Our standardized RWAs o
f $370 billion 
decreased by $17 billion over the quarter driven primarily by lower credit 
RWAs on reduced lending and commitments through syndications and pay
-
downs in the quarter. As a result, our Basel III standardized common equity 
tier
-
1 ratio is expec
ted to be approximately 16.7%. Our supplementary 
leverage ratio remained flat at 6.4%.
 
During the quarter we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common 
stock or 24 million shares. Our Board declared a $0.30 dividend per share 
and our tax rate in the 
third quarter was $24.4%. As we look ahead to the 
first quarter we are cognizant of the seasonal headwinds, but we are 
encouraged that we are off to a good start. Strong volumes and increased 
client engagement associated with the recent pick up in volatili
ty, have 
benefited the franchise thus far. Of course while bouts of volatility can 
support revenues, sustained volatility can erode confidence and close market 
access. We have not seen that to date.
 
We believe that the economic backdrop is strong character
ized by broad 
global growth. Assuming these macro conditions persist, clients are active 
and markets remain open and functioning. We will press our advantages and 
look to continue to gain wallet share.
 
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan 
Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My first one is on deposits, 
they've been definitely
 
in focus for the wealth management side and I know 
you gave some comments on that Jon, thanks for that, but we had the first 
wave I believe of CDs, your CD program that was scheduled to mature over 
the summer, so it would be great if you could maybe let u
s know what sort 
of customer behavior you've noticed with that money and what portion of 
that cash are you retaining and what kind of products are customers moving 
into with that cash?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure, so as you mentioned we did have some CDs mature d
uring the period. 
What we're generally seeing although this is all new for us since we've just 
gotten into these products over the last 18 months, is that a good amount of 
those dollars go into the investments accounts of those clients while some 
portion g

retained in the bank it has been retained in the system. Those dollars 
continue to go into both equities and fixed income. We have seen a little bit 
more of a shift into the fixed income invest
ing than we did probably what we 
saw in 2017, but all in all it has been sort of both a nice way to supplement 
liquidity in the bank, but also bring in new assets to the firm.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Terrific, thanks for that. And then on the equity side you guys 

 
trends and 
the share gains have been really impressive. I know this might be somewhat 
of a high class problem, but do you have any thoughts or insights into how 
your customers are thinking about concentration risks? Are there any limits 
to thinking about 
further share gains particularly in the financing side of the 
business?
 
James Gorman
 
Listen Brennan, as you mentioned we've gained significant share over the 
last four or five years. I think what we're benefiting from now is more of a 
stable share in a gro
wing market. The equity product this year is up pretty 
dramatically over last year and it has been down for a couple of years in a 
row, so this is a good positive play. And I think we do believe that we can 
continue to growth share, although at slower pace
s.
 
We continue to invest in the franchise particularly around both product, 
people, geographies, international footprint and technology. So I would say 
that we feel very comfortable with our share. We feel very comfortable we 
will be able to maintain that 
share and there are pockets where we continue 
to believe that we can grow that share but it would be at a slower pace than 
we've seen in the last five years.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your 
line is open.
 
Mi
ke Mayo
 
Hi, can you hear me?
 
James Gorman
 
We can Mike.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Okay, good. Just could you elaborate a little bit more on the deposit strategy 
in growth and it just seems to be getting a little bit more competitive with 
more of the banks pursuing a nation
al digital banking strategy. What are you 
seeing, at what point would you pivot your strategy based on what you're 
saying?
 

margin and if you do what has it done and what you expect 
it to do?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'll go with the second one first. The answer is no. Again, we try to focus on 
the net interest income in the wealth business and you can see that that 
business the NII has grown about 4% to 5% year
-
to
-
date.
 
On the first 


and savings. We're working on new premier cash management products and 
we continued to enhance our digital strategies a
round both payments and 
deposits for our client base.
 
We're at historical low levels of cash and client accounts and our deposits 
are really more impacted by sort of our clients asset allocation than actual 
rates. The debate is on our deposits have actuall
y outperformed our models 
and continue to outperform our models, but what we've seen whereas cash 

at about 6% and what those do after or 
--
 
in light of some of the market 
volatility is
 


cash levels go down.
 

We're continuing to 
invest in the product suite. You can see that we have 
grown deposits a little bit quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our clients are very open to 

products and rollout new offerings we seem to see a very 
good take up. So 
again at this point competitive business, but we feel good with our position.

Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche 
Bank. Your lin
e is open.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Matt O'Connor
 

-
to
-

stock it's obviously 
been under a lot of pressure this year and I think its 
concern over the sustainability of revenue. But as you think about the cost 
side and if you can just talk about how much flexibility there is to bring in 
costs if the revenues come in weaker say next y
ear than you expect?
 
James Gorman
 


ROTCE are up 40% year
-
over
-
year. Revenues, on annualized basis were up
 

-
tax margin numbers that we said were above 

below 73% on total compensation and the stock is down at least pre
-
market 
this morning it was down or las
t night 7% to 8% year
-
to
-
date.
 


the institutional businesses. So I guess there are smarter investors than 
my
self out there who have got this figured out. But to me it seems like with 

reconcile with the stock being down. So what I care about frankly is the 
long
-
term positioning of the firm.
 

demonstrated in this quarter, to deliver $9.9 billion of revenue in a summer 
quarter that was unheard of a couple of years ago. And look at some of the 
metrics where the resilie
nce are, I was just looking some numbers this 
morning around the assets that are in wealth management sitting inside the 
$10 million plus household and many of those households are many 
multiples of $10 million.
 
Back in 2009 that number was slightly over $


stable money than the next segment of million to 10 million the same. So if 
you look at the share question that came up about the 
-
 
particularly 
the 


 
The industry is consolidated. In fact those with superior technology and 
great franchises have gained share be
cause clients want that far from there 
being concentration risk clients have wanted to be with two or three players 
and we have obviously been a huge beneficiary because we have in my 
humble opinion best
-
in
-
class equities business across the street.
 
So yes
, back to the sort of near
-
term on your question, if the market turns 
then we respond. We do what we needed to do on the expense side and we 

of 13.1% year
-
to
-



through a complete major crisis environment which I do not expect at all, 

downt
ick in the market, yes we pick up some volatility and then over time 
our revenues would trail off a little bit, but the fundamentals are very 
strong.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Thank you. And I think the other concern obviously is the capital deployment 
and the results
 



 
what's going 
on in the market or specifically response to the CCAR results if you could 
comment on that and then if there is stil
l further optimization that you can 
do to the CET
-
1 after going up 90 bps this quarter?
 
James Gorman
 

the second question is what is likely to evolve on the regulatory front, not
 
just in 2019 but over the next three or four years. And if you look at what 
we did last year obviously, we did a distribution equivalent to what we did 
--
 

-
to
-
date we have 
accreted $6.9 billion net
 
income to common. By the way full year last year 
was 6.6, so through three quarters we're at 6.9. Our capital distribution 


ow 20s, 23% or something, 
it is $0.30 a quarter, so that is about 20%.
 

same time and at the stock, good news is stock trading at 43 bucks, you are 
buying back a lot of stock with th
at distribution. Now over time if the stock 
trades back to where I think the value is reflected in the ROE performance, 
then you have got different strategic choices as to how you distribute the 
capital.
 


have significant buyback programs just because we are accreting so much 


 
and unless you can find ways to invest that in the 
business to generate those kinds of returns, I think it is shareholder friendly 
to h
ave a strong dividend, have strong buyback and make the appropriate 
investments to build growth into the business. But we can kind of do all 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question c
omes from Mike Carrier with Bank of 
America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Hey, good morning guys. This is [indiscernible] on for Michael Carrier. Just 

compe
titive environment in ISG, I think specifically in FICC with tighter 

the usual strong players just competing more aggressively given the lower 
volatility or are you seeing some mo
re like reinvigorated competition from 
maybe the European peers?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

other quarter, ISG across the complex of Fed, equity as in investment 
banking is very competit

either maintain our share or grow our share. In the fixed income space we 
have picked up share over the last several years since the restructuring 

 
business is in such 
good shape. We are running probably 10% to 12% share when we use to 

pool of revenues are not really growing.
 
As I mentioned earlier in equity is very competitive 
business but we have a 
comprehensive business in offering and as James mentioned best
-
in
-
class 
and we continue to maintain our share and capture growing revenue pool. 
And then in banking the global footprint and the stability of our franchise has 
led to so
me really strong results and we picked up share in banking. So 
again, a very competitive environment. We expect to continue to maintain 
and grow our share given the stability and the momentum in the franchise 

t.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Okay, thanks for the detail. I guess as a quick followup, given the volatility 

an update on what how this impacts your business maybe specifically in IM 
or
 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. As I mentioned earlier the investment line was impacted this quarter 
because of some of the volatility in both the rates in emerging markets. As 
you know some of our alternatives and equity strategies a
re in Asia, so I 

the sort of the tail on the dog, the primary driver of revenue growth for us in 
that business is going to be around the fee
-
based assets and we continue to 
see c
ontinued good flows into our long
-
term assets. The last seven quarters, 
we have seen $20 billion of inflows and active management, active 
strategies are working for us. So again it will have some impact, but we feel 
very good about the overall health of th
at business and we have seen very 
stable fee rates there too which is another reason we feel good about that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with 
Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning. There wa
s a comment in your press release on institutional 
securities that the other sales and trading net losses were down quite a bit 
versus year
-
ago reflecting lower net funding costs and I was just wondering, 

gful and it sounds like a 
great thing but how do you reconcile that with higher interest rates?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

things in that line, some of which is the hedging activity and ot
her things 
that flow through that. We also have some assets in that business, basically 
the businesses have been optimizing their balance sheet and their funding 
and that sort of collectively the net result being the statement we made in 
the press release 

usage not rate.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
And is there any sustainability to that or just in terms of overall funding 
costs or it was just something that was helpful this quarter?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think it wa
s helpful this quarter. That number is going to be volatile 
because there are a couple of things in there, that sometimes offset each 

that businesses require and how we optimize t
he balance sheet and again 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. 
Your line is open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thank you. Further on the conversation of
 
stability, I mean wealth 
management, investment management are half the firm's revenues. 

deposit efforts, the comp trends the only offset I see is the lower 
transactions. I mean this i
s a market sensitive business obviously, but can 
pre
-
tax and that combines business grow in a flattish market environment?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, I mean it depends how you manage the business. I mean as you 
pointed out a lot of the revenues come from non
-
mar
ket related activities. 
And secondly there is shift in market related activities. So money moving 
from transaction accounts hurts the transaction revenue but as it moves into 
asset management accounts, it improves the revenues. So the net is actually 
net g
ain on the switch of assets as they occur clients move out of 
transactions into managed money.
 
So there is a lot of stuff going on in that business and obviously next year 

with 

for the last several years. So the annual to cover the deferred recruiting 
expenses is coming down each year.
 

j
ump likely across wealth and asset management in a flat market 
environment, but there is definitely operational improvements that can be 
made.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. And believe it or not I also read the press release. There was 
something in there in the insti
tutional business on a modest gain on the sale 
of the business just curious on how big and what business that was?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, that was deal that was announced I believe in the second quarter, it 
closed in the third quarter. We were an owner of a bus
iness called the 
MuniCenter and it was a good, I am just trying to see the line item, it was a 
good percentage of that line item. It was about $60 million, $61 million, $62 
million.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe 
Research. Your line is open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Hi good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So I just wanted to start off with a question on equity market sensitivity and 
James it was interesting to hear your perspective on some of the 
factors 
weighing on the stock and maybe some of the underappreciated revenue 
stability. It appears to us that one of the big concerns is your higher 
sensitivity to movement in equity markets and equity market declines which 
certainly comes to mind given th
e latest move. I was hoping you can give us 
some insight about how you think about earnings resiliency in a sustained 
market correction and given some of the commentary around the movement 
in cash balances how much of an offset you think that can provide i
f equity 
market weakness persists?
 
James Gorman
 
I mean listen, we had a more challenging third quarter, both from market 
activity and just seasonal volumes and we delivered an ROE of 11.5% in that 
environment, so and tax adjusted that's probably [10% to 0.
25%] [ph] for 
what it would have been last year. The best we've done up until then was on 
an annual basis it was 9.4%. So that's in a pretty subdued trading market 
and not 
-
 
definitely not robust equity market environment.
 
I think though if you look across
 
the franchise there is still M&A transactions 
getting done. The prime brokerage business is very resilient. There's still 
trading across the fixed income businesses whatever's going on in the 

 
always 
been a little stronger in the macro.
 
And then in micro SPG and the other credit businesses well positioned. So 
we're not as correlated to equity market movements as I think is sort of 
believed if you actually look at the stability of the franchise 
across each of 
the businesses. Now clearly if you have a sustained correction call it 20% 


$9.9 billion o
f revenue and we've only ever had two quarters of more than 
$10 billion in revenue and that was the first and second quarter of this year.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Thanks for that color James. It's very helpful. And maybe just one follow up 
on operating leverage, cle
arly demonstrated strong expense discipline in the 
quarter 200 bps of efficiency improvement year
-
on
-
year. It seems like the 
Street is contemplating some revenue growth from here in line with GDP, 
but numbers suggest that there is some skepticism that will
 
translate into 
positive operating leverage. I was just wondering from your perspective, 
how you think about balancing the need to continue to deliver margin 
improvement versus some of the higher investment needs as you look out to 
other growth opportuniti
es?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, I don't 
-
 
I honestly I think you're raising a very good point and I don't 
-
 
if that's the view of some people on the Street I don't understand that view. 
I mean, there's obviously operating leverage in a business that has the scale 
th
at we've got across wealth management, across the prime [brokerage] 
[ph] space, the core large investment banking businesses the incremental 
dollar revenue is coming on at a much higher rate than the embedded dollar 
revenue across all of our businesses.
 
So
 
unless you get 
-
 
yes we've going to have to invest, but that's part of 
what's called the incremental dollar of revenue to come on at 30% margin 
rather than a 50% margin, that's part of the investment profile. But to the 
assumption that you would not gener
ate operating leverage with revenue 

We've had year
-
to
-
date 12% revenue growth and the expense ratio has 
dropped from 73% to 70.3%. We haven't done anything to consciously 
reduce ex
penses.
 
We haven't shut businesses, we haven't sold businesses, we haven't had a 
major [ref] [ph]. In fact we've had huge investments. We opened 
-
 
just 
opening another fusion center for our cyber in Singapore. I was out there a 
couple of weeks ago and we c
ontinue to invest in the cyber space. We're 
continuing to invest across all of our technology platforms, in automation, in 
AI and big data or cloud computing, digital, our whole digital initiative across 
wealth management expansion across the asset managem
ent businesses 
and building out new platforms, raising new funds. All of these are 
investments that we're making continuously and we've been hiring talent. So 
there's just no way if we produce another $3 billion of revenue that you're 
not bringing that on 
at a high margin than the existing margin that is just 
not going to happen.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham. 
Your line is open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Hey good morning. Maybe just following up James on the stability of 
e
arnings and revenue and how that translates to capital, because I think 
the, I guess one of the issues I struggled with I think investors have 
struggled with is you have sort of the biggest drop in the stress test in CET1. 
And that obviously could have an 
impact if and when we moved to the SCP. 
So how has dialogue gone, how do you convince or think about stress tests 
and how that impacts your ability to return even more capital given that 
your ratios are dramatically higher than your peers?
 
James 
Gorman
 
Yes, well Jim it is the question and I'll start and we should spend some time 
on it and I want Jon to weigh in on this because he's been pivotal to all the 
discussions we've had in DC and with our regulators. The first question is, 
are you capital s
ufficient? And that was addressed squarely last year with 
notwithstanding the results of the test under what most would suggest were 
unusually stressful scenarios, let me just put it that way, that we and other 
banks we're all committed to distribute the s
ame level of capital that we 
distribute in 2017. So that basically says check, you are capital sufficient.
 
The second question is are you accreting capital above what you need to 
support the investment of the businesses whether it's investments you're 
maki
ng, whether it's growing sheet in different parts of the business and as I 
said with net income this year already at $6.9 billion, we're heading for an 
$8 billion plus net income the record I believe was $6.6 million last year. So 
clearly, we are accreting
 
capital above what our investment needs are.
 
The third question is what will the regulatory environment the rules permit 
you to do? And we're in a transition period. I mean we're going from a pure 
CCAR structure to an SEB structure. I don't believe that c
hange 
-
 
in fact I'm 
sure that change is not going to happen for 2019. So 2020 on it will. There 
remain several open questions, how do you calculate so on just a more 
narrow that sort of 2019 CCAR, will there be changes to the scenarios that 
would generate 
a different kind of outcome from 2018?
 
In other words was 2018 the high watermark in terms of scenario severity. I 
believe it was, but until we see the scenarios, we 
-
 
I don't know. I mean we 
don't have access to that information, but I would suggest it is
 
highly likely 
that we have seen the high watermark. And by the way that high watermark 
translates into us suffering losses many times the size of what we actually 
did during the crisis, so it is a high watermark.
 
The second is then how does the model appl
y themselves to the particular 
make up of individual firms and that translates into your stress losses, your 
PPP&I et cetera and again I don't want to prejudge that. I'd like to just sort 
of see that play out, but worst case is we will not be worse than la
st year 
and we have accreted more money than last year. So by definition we 
should be in a better position than last year.
 
The more interesting has been 2020 on will there be accounted cyclical 
buffer put in as some have suggested, I doubt it. Is the stres
s test buffer, 
the SEB buffer likely to remain at the initial levels that were put at that 
remains to be seen it won't get worse. It could come down a little bit to 
make it more consistent with what the Europeans and foreign banks are 
dealing with.
 
So I gu

the high watermark in terms of stress scenarios. I mean at some point, you 
can stress anything. You could have capital equal to the size of your balance 
sheet, have a leverage ratio of 1 t

economy. So at what level do you pass the inflection point where you're 
doing, you are affecting economic growth rather than generating it? And I 
think we've peaked at that level. That's my guess. And in this transiti
on it 
will play out that we will as we keep accreting at this level we should be able 
to increase that capital distributions. Exactly how much, we have to see 
what the models produce. Jon?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, I think James actually was pretty comprehensiv

in this transition period. We've been encouraged by the comments regarding 
tailored supervision. We've been encouraged by the comments by both 
Chairman Powell, and Governor Quarles around the industry being 
appropriately capitalize
d which we have said since 2016, we believe we are 
sufficiently capitalized and we are starting to accrete more capital and 
currently in the forward 12 months going to payout less than 100%.
 
So over time we will continue to either invest in our business or
 
return that 

going to go through some changes and we believe we'll be able to continue 
to offer our shareholders an attractive capital return profile.
 
James Gorman
 
And the last thi
ng I'll just add to this is, two bugaboos that I had for a long 

scenario where your balance sheet grows during a time of financial stress 
and deflation of financial assets. And secondly, 
I don't understand why 
boards would continue to do a full capital distribution for nine quarters after 
an economic crisis, financial crisis has occurred.
 
Under the current thinking around the SEB structure, our balance sheets 
would not grow, that obviously
 
makes both intellectual and intuitive sense, 
and secondly I believe that the capital what you would be required to 
continue to distribute would be just dividends for one year. Now these rules 
are in, they are in some state of development and comment perio
d, so I 
don't know where it ends up.
 
But both of those things would suggest that the constraint that has been 
most powerful for Morgan Stanley which has been our leverage ratio 
because that balance sheet grows, if your balance sheet is not growing, then 
th
at opens up a whole different kind of discussion and as you pointed out at 
the beginning we get back to CET1 or total capital ratios our numbers are 
phenomenal. So we've got we got to see how this thing plays out, but the 
bottom line I believe we've hit th
e high watermark and move past it.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
All right, well that was comprehensive, I appreciate it. If I could just maybe 
ask one thing unrelated to capital, just on the 
-
 
I think there has been a lot 
of concern about NII growth from here, is your sen
se that at least could you 
update us on kind of the pick
-
up in yields in growing the loan book versus 
the securities portfolio as you kind of see that loan growth, should we expect 
and margin can continue to move a little higher?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, I think 
that is the right characterization. I think the last quarter we 
mentioned that we saw NII growth in the 4% to 5% range for the year, we 
are still comfortable with that. We also said that it would be driven by 
average earning asset growth or loan growth and
 
that's really what's been 
driving it. If you look over year
-
to
-
year, average earning assets are up 
about $7 billion or $8 billion and that is really primarily driven by the loan 
growth and that's primarily driving the NII growth.
 
We have seen healthy incr
ease in asset yields, but as we mentioned earlier, 
that's really been offset really by the change in mix of our liability structure 

which was a suite product. In the third quarter of
 
2017 that represented 
closer to 90% of our deposits, today it represents closer to 75% of our 
deposits.
 
So that increasing asset yield has been sort of absorbed by the increase in 
the liability costs and therefore average earning asset growth will be the 
primary driver and we're still pretty comfortable with our ability to grow 
loans and our wealth business in the last couple of quarters, we've been 
growing at $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter and that feels healthy to us and 
that also feels sustainable.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. 
Your line is open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Thanks. Good morning. I guess a follow
-
up question here just on the growth 
strategy and outlook in wealth management. I know some of the things 
y
ou've highlighted are gaining more wallet from existing customers in the 

relationships with younger customers through technology and then 
marketing to the stock plan participants. So I'd just
 
love it if you could 
maybe touch on all those channels in terms of the longer term potential and 
then any anecdotes that maybe is making you feel good about where you 
are with some of the newer initiatives like the younger customers who are 
penetrating ki
nd of the stock plan, I'm assuming that's where we'll see 
growth accelerate as well?
 
James Gorman
 
I think you've done a nice job of articulating where we think we're going to 
get growth from in the business and really I think the biggest opportunity 
long
-
t
erm and either or medium to long
-
term is really around asset 
aggregation our ability to attract incremental assets from our customers. We 
know they have a lot of money outside of the firm and some of the 
encouraging anecdotal stories as we roll out some of
 
these new strategies is 
that our clients are much more open to sharing their financial information 
with us.
 
I think years ago it was sort of you didn't want to aggregate all your assets 
at one firm, I think we are seeing a little bit of a shift in that an
d as we roll 
out asset aggregation and the next best action and some of the programs 
that we've been rolling out to the FA community, we are seeing good take 
up in that.
 
I would say the stock plan growth and the younger client growth, both of 
those are 
also sort of in their infancy in terms of the strategies and the 
implementation and they should long
-
term be attractive ways to aggregate 
assets. Remember a lot of the young clients don't have as much wealth as 
our older clients, so it's going to be a slow
 
build, but we continue to make 
the investments in the digital strategies and the stock plan program to be 
able to position ourselves to bring in more assets over time. So I think the 
most immediate opportunity is really trying to attract incremental asset
s 
from our existing client base.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Okay, great. And then just a followup here would be maybe good to get a 
little bit more perspective on just the investment banking activity levels in 
the various businesses and then clearly, some concern in the m
arket just 
around kind of being late cycle. And so, I'm just curious if you guys are 
actually seeing those kind of normal signs of late cycle activity whether it 
would be over extending on deals or over paying or just indiscriminate 
buying, just anything t
hat would tell you that we're kind of little late cycle in 
those businesses?
 
James Gorman
 

real indications. The healthy, pipelines are very healthy. If you look at the 
pace of an

markets are open. Our IPO and debt underwriting backlogs are healthy and 
we're bringing things to market. Now if we get into a period of prolonged 
volatility, that might close access, but we haven't
 
really seen it.
 

cash flow driven market and cash flows are quite healthy, so a lot of activity 
in that space. There's been some repricing, but deals are still getting done 
insi
de of flex and for good deals, we see a lot of good support. So other than 

our business perspective.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. 
Your 
line is open.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Thank you, good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
I apologize if you guys addressed this, I had to jump on and off your call, 
but the first question is how quickly do your customers in wealth 
management ex
pect to see higher interest rates passed on to them in there, 
I know you mentioned Jon that I think cash is down to about 6% of 

raises rates, do you have to rise your rates within da
ys of that to keep them 
satisfied?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
You know again, I think you've got to think about these deposits for what 
they are and historically these are really transactional, people have them in 
the bottom of their investment accounts to transact, 
to buy and sell 

investment thesis the percentage of cash that people are holding is lower 

 

etitive with our primary competitors 
in this space. We have our beta tab outperformed our model betas, so it's 
really not as rate sensitive if you will, it's really asset allocation sensitive. 
And as people reduce their cash amounts we'll see continue outf
lows. That 
being said we're in a prolonged market rally here and historically if we go 
into a different market environment we've seen people pull cash out and put 
it back in their accounts. It is very similar to sort of checking accounts, I 
mean it's the s
ame sort of dynamic. So the answer is betas have 

 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Very good, and then the second question is more of a qualitative question 
from what you guys are seeing out in the m
arkets, clearly credit quality 
across the banking industry is very strong today. Your consumer wealth 
management area high quality, you don't have much trading risk anymore 
with the VAR being where it is, but what are you guys seeing or what are 
your folks
 
telling you that they are seeing in the so
-
called shadow banking 
sector the leverage lending area. We're hearing that there seems to be some 
aggressive underwriting going on, is that a concern for you folks 12, 24 
months down the road or just any color yo
u can give us on what you guys 
are seeing out in the markets?
 
James Gorman
 
I mean my gut, Jon is going to say something we're going to have to wrap 
up in a couple minutes , but my gut is I 
-
 
if other people want to engage in 
dumb practices God bless them, 
but we're not and that's what I'm focused 
on. So yes, there's always somebody out there right who's doing the 
marginal deal. What I care about is and that's not going to blow up the 
market, but what I care about is overall asset bubbles or not and we're no
t 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, and so I mean, I think specifically I agree with James specifically and 
our portfolios we've actually seen improving metrics in the ISC credit quality. 

been very active securitizer in some 
of our product, and then on the wealth side you said it's been very stable. 
We've not been impacted by some of these unfortunate hurricanes that 
we've seen across the country and very, very stable metrics for us.
 
Operat
or
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your 
line is open.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
Okay, thanks. Yes, just a followup question on the corporate lending. It 
looks like the non
-
investment grade exposures are down quite meaningfully 
yea
r
-
on
-
year and then you also saw some drop downs too in the 
commitments sequentially. Are you guys actively de
-
risking in the loans and 
lending business and in the institutional securities business?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
The answer is we're not actively 
de
-
risking. We saw a couple of dynamics in 
the September numbers we were fronting some deals which is why it looks 
like that we had a much higher exposure to non
-
investment grade when in 
reality we didn't really have those exposures because they were syndi
cated 
across the bank lending, excuse me, the bank syndicate.
 
And then on the de
-
risking point we just saw a lot of activity around the 
event book and as I mentioned earlier we're also active in the commercial 
real estate securitization market. We skewed m
ore of our business in that 
area towards securitization versus held for investment just given the 
profiling where we are in the cycle. So again, we've been very disciplined 
around it. That was really a function of just a lot of activity in the third 
quarte
r and we expect to continue to sort of rebuild those pipelines and be 
active in those markets.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
Okay and then just one followup real quick, you mentioned the clients are 
moving a fewer providers within the equities business and I thought th
at 
trend started a few years back for the prime brokerage business, is it still 
early innings for cash business as well as derivatives business?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes and I think we are the number one provider of those services. We've got 
a very strong franc
hise there. We have seen a little bit of consolidation with 
MiFID going into places people to reduce the number of counterparties they 
deal with, but I think the general comment was generally the top providers, 
top three or top four or top five depending o
n the market where the 
products have generally been gaining share and we would expect that trend 
will continue.

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James

James P. Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. 
Before I comment on our 


for almost five years and while we have accomplished a number of things 

t this firm is 
close to reaching its full potential. The stability and cohesiveness of the 
team, significant depth of talent across the organization, commitment from 
our people, re
-
shaping of our business model all position us for significant 
growth, and I
 
would call Morgan Stanley as a client focused firm and our 
philosophy has always been to do first class business in a first class way. 
With the current regulatory paradigm having a client
-
centric business model 
is key to sustainable success.
 
The opportuni
ties in front of us are based on increasing client penetration 
and accelerating new client acquisition and may include building on our 
leading position in [inaudible] cross
-
border M&A deals with particular 
success in Japan and our other strong banking fran
chises. The growth of our 
bank, both in wealth management and institutional securities, raising new 
fronts in merchant banking and real estate and the use of technology to 
improve the efficiency in which we serve our clients with a hi
-
tech, high 
touch appr
oach across the entire franchise. Those are just some examples.
 
Now turning briefly to the quarter, we grew our revenue and profitability 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter and year
-
over
-
year in both wealth management and 
institutional securities. Firm wide revenues, ex
cluding DVA were up 7% 
compared to the third quarter of last year. In the wealth management 
business our revenues grew 9% versus a year ago driven by the continued 
execution of our bank strategy as well as revenue tailwinds from high 
markets. Notably our m
argin improved to 22%.
 
Fee
-
based assets as a percent of client assets increased to 38%, up from 
36% last year and just 23% when we closed on the initial portion of the 
acquisition a few years ago. Revenues in all of our major institutional 
businesses were 
up versus a year ago. Investment banking revenues were 
up 35%. Fixed income results, excluding DVA were up 19%, notwithstanding 
continued reduction in RWAs. Our equity sales and trading revenues were 
high versus last year as we continued to execute across 
products and 
regions and that franchise remains number one in the world. The momentum 
of our businesses also drove continued improvements in our earnings and 
ROE.
 
EPS excluding the tax benefits and DVA in this quarter and a year ago was 
up about 40% while 
our ROE on the same basis increased a 180 basis points 


returns and reducing the capital and expenses in fixed in
come and 
commodities over the last few years. We believe there may still be 
meaningful opportunities to optimize the remaining components of 
commodities beyond the recent TransMontaigne sale as we continue to drive 
for higher returns.
 

ays vigilant with all our resources, especially the 
balance sheet. A final thought, we believe we remain well positioned for 
further capital actions given the magnitude of our fundamental strategic 
change and our improving earnings profile. The CCAR proces
s is engrained in 
every aspect of our business.
 
I will now turn the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in details.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the 
effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in 
the footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures. The impact of DVA 
in the quarter was positive $215 million with $132 million in fixed income 
sales and trading and $83 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the 
impact of 
DVA firm
-
wide revenues were $8.7 billion, up 2% versus the 
second quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the 
third quarter was 21%, reflecting a discrete tax benefit of $237 million or 
$0.12 per diluted share principally associated 
with the repatriation of non
-
US 
earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated.
 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders excluding DVA were $1.5 billion. Earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share 
excluding DVA were $0.77 after preferred 
dividends. On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA firm
-
wide revenues 
for the quarter were $8.9 billion. Earnings from continuing operations 
applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.7 billion. 
Re
ported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.84 
after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $34.17 
per share and tangible book value was $29.25 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet our total assets were $8
14 billion at September 
30, down from $827 billion at the end of the second quarter. Deposits as of 
quarter end were $124 billion, up $7billion versus Q1. Our liquidity reserve 
at the end of the quarter was $190 billion compared with $192 billion at the 
en
d of the second quarter. Year
-
to
-
date we benefited from strong global 
demand for our credit enabling us to pull forward issuance from future 
periods reflecting broad global investor participation.
 
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final
, we believe that 
our common equity Tier
-
1 transitional ratio will be approximately 14.3% and 
our Tier
-
1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 16.1%.
 
Basel III transitional risk
-
weighted assets are expected to be approximately 
$415 billion 
at September 30. Reflecting our best estimate of the final set of 
reserve rules our pro forma common equity Tier
-
1 ratio using the Basel III 
fully
-
phased in advanced approach was 12.6% at September 30, up from 
12.3% in the second quarter.
 
Our pro forma sta
ndardized ratio was 11.7%, up from 10.7% in 2Q. Pro 
forma fully
-
phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be 
approximately $423 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary 
leverage ratio under the U.S. final rule to be approximately 4.9% at 
Se
ptember 30, up from 4.6% at the end of 2Q. These estimates are 
preliminary and are subject to revision.
 
Turning to expenses, our total expenses this quarter were $6.7 billion flat 
versus the second quarter. Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In 
i
nstitutional securities revenues, excluding DVA, were $4.3 billion up 3% 
sequentially. Non
-
interest expense was $3.3 billion flat versus the second 
quarter. Compensation expense was $1.8 billion for the third quarter, up 3% 
versus the second quarter in
-
lin
e with the increase in revenues and 
reflecting a 41% ratio excluding DVA.
 
Non
-
compensation expense for the third quarter was $1.5 billion, down 3% 
versus the second quarter. The business reported a pretax profit of $1 billion 
excluding the impact of DVA. I
ncluding the impact of DVA revenues were 
$4.5 billion and the pretax profit was $1.2 billion.
 
In investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 6% versus last 
quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number 1 in 
global IPOs and n
umber 2 in global announced and completed M&A at the 
end of the second quarter. Notable transactions included in advisory, Morgan 
Stanley acted as sole financial adviser to Sigma
-
Aldrich in the announced 
$17 billion sales to German Merck. Morgan Stanley al
so acted as financial 
advisor to Dresser
-
Rand in the announced agreement to be acquired by 
Siemens for $7.6 billion in cash.
 
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as joint Bookrunner on the 
U.S. $25 billion IPO of Alibaba Group, the largest IPO in h
istory. Morgan 
Stanley also acted as Lead Left Bookrunner and stabilization agent on the 
$3.5 billion IPO for Citizens Financial Group. The IPO represented the largest 
U.S. bank IPO in history and the largest U.S. financial institution IPO since 
2007.
 
In d
ebt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as Lead Left Bookrunner for 
Tyson Foods on its $3.25 billion of senior unsecured notes in multiple 
tranches to finance its acquisition of Hillshire Brands. This financing 
complemented our role as lead financial adviso
r to Tyson on its acquisition 
Lead Left arranger for an $8.2 billion committed bridge facility and Lead Left 
Bookrunner and stabilization agent for the $2.4 billion offering of common 
stock and tangible equity units.
 
Advisory revenues of $392 million decre
ased 6% versus our second quarter 
results driven by lower results in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Morgan Stanley 
remains a leader in cross border activity.
 
Underwriting revenues of $948 million decreased 7% versus our second 
quarter results. They were strong for
 
third quarter driven by equity 
underwriting revenues of $464 million, which were down 5% versus the 
second quarter, reflecting lower volumes in the Americas and EMEA partially 
offset by strength in Asia Pacific.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $484 
million were lower versus the 
second quarter primarily due to declines in investment grade and high yield 
bonds that were partially offset by higher revenue from loans. Equity sales 
and trading revenues, excluding DVA were $1.8 billion, flat compared to la
st 
quarter. Results were strong across products and geographies demonstrating 
less seasonality than is typical for the third quarter. Solid client activity and 
the underwriting calendar drove cash revenues above second quarter levels. 
Derivative revenues a
lso increased sequentially on higher client activity. 
Prime brokerage revenues were lower reflecting reduced activity in Europe.
 
Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA 
were $1 billion, flat versus the second quarter. Macro rev
enues were up 
significantly this quarter, most notably in foreign exchange which benefited 
from improved market conditions with higher volatility.
 
Securitized products and credit products revenues declined on lower 
secondary client activity and less favora
ble market conditions. Commodities 
revenues were meaningfully lower reflecting lower client activity and a 
difficult market environment. CVA was a benefit in the quarter. Other 
revenues were $225 million, up versus $108 million in the second quarter, 
drive
n by a gain on the sale of TransMontaigne and the sale of our retail 
property space. Average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million, 
down from $48 million in the second quarter.
 
Turning to wealth management revenues were $3.8 billion in the 
quarter, up 
2% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.2 billion were up 5% 
versus last quarter reflecting higher market and positive flows.
 
Transaction revenues were down compared to last quarter, consisting 
primarily of commissions of $503 million 
essentially flat to the prior quarter, 
investment banking related fees of $224 million, up 5% versus last quarter, 
reflecting a pickup in closed end funds and trading revenues of $185 million, 
down 31% versus the second quarter, driven by primarily by lowe
r marks in 
our deferred compensation plans.
 
Net interest revenue increased 4% to $601 million, driven primarily by 
higher revenues from our bank deposit program. Other revenue of $112 
million increased versus the second quarter primarily due to the gain on
 
sale 
of a retail property space. Non
-
interest expense was $2.9 billion flat versus 
last quarter. Non
-
compensation expense was $767 million effectively flat to 
last quarter.
 
Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, flat versus the second quarter. The 
compens
ation ratio was 58% down versus the second quarter driven by 
revenue mix including ongoing growth in net interest income. The PBT 
margin was 22.1%, up versus 20.6% in the second quarter. PBT margin 
excluding the benefit from the sale of a retail property s
pace was 21.3% in 
the quarter.
 
Profit before tax was $836 million. Total client assets were $2 trillion, global 
fee based asset inflows were $6.5 billion, fee
-
based assets under 
management increased to $768 billion at quarter end, representing 38% of 
clien
t assets. Global representatives were 16,162, essentially flat to the 
second quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $129 billion, up 
$2 billion versus the second quarter. Approximately $116 billion were held in 
Morgan Stanley Bank.
 
Wealth manag
ement lending balances continued to grow reflecting the 
ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Lending balances increased $3.5 
billion in the quarter. Investment management revenues of $655 million 
were down 5% sequentially. In traditional asset managemen
t revenues of 
$456 million were up 5% versus the second quarter, driven by positive flows 
and higher markets and partially offset by lower marks and deferred 
compensation plans.
 
In real estate investing revenues of $113 million were flat to the second 
quar
ter. Merchant banking revenues were $86 million down 41% driven by 
lower investment gains in the quarter. Non
-
interest expenses were $467 
million, down 4% from the second quarter consisting of compensation 
expense of $253 million reflecting a compensation 
ratio of 39% and down 
versus the second quarter, driven by lower marks on deferred compensation 
plans and the mix of revenues in the quarter.
 
Non
-
compensation expense was $214 million, up from $196 million in the 
second quarter primarily due to the settlem
ent of a legal matter. Profit 
before tax was $188 million, down 8% sequentially. NCI was $18 million 
versus $7 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to 
$398 billion driven by higher flows, partially offset by market depreciation 
dri
ven primarily by foreign exchange.
 
In conclusion, our outlook is guided by the meaningful transformation we've 
made during the last five years and benefits from growth in our most 
[annuity
-
like] businesses. First, our wealth management business continues 
t
o have momentum with growing profitability from the secular trend toward 
managed money. We entered the fourth quarter with a modest tailwind from 
stronger equity markets at the end of Q3 and clients remain engaged as 
they assess evolving opportunities in m
arkets.
 
Second, we continue to have earnings upside with ongoing loan growth in 
our bank. This remains a differentiated contributor because we benefit from 
asset optimization on a growing loan book even without the benefit of rising 
rates. As we enter the 
fourth quarter the pipeline for loan origination 
remains strong in both wealth management and institutional securities.
 
Third, our investment banking pipeline remains healthy. In advisory it is 
broad
-
based across industry and geography and generates financ
ing 
opportunities. Ongoing market volatility may affect institutional results if it 
persists. However we view recent volatility as a repeat of a theme seen 
frequently during the last several years with growing activity levels across 
products and businesses
 
building, only to be disrupted by macro events than 
followed by a reset. A reset could occur with recognition that stronger 
growth in the U.S. may offset challenges in other economies.
 
Finally our capital and liquidity position continue to be a source of 
strength. 
Our healthy capital ratios on both an absolute and relative basis reflect the 
robust foundation and evidence of our ongoing successful execution of our 
business and balance sheet strategy.
 
Thank you for listening. James and I will now take your q
uestions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions). And the first question will come from Glenn Shorr 
with ISI.
 
Glenn Shorr

ISI
 
Hello.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Glenn Shorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Good morning. Maybe just a qu
ick one on the mechanics of this whole fair 
value of deferred comps that showed up in both in your comments in both 
investment management and wealth management. If I heard you correctly it 
hits both the revenue line and the comp line.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Correct.
 
G
lenn Shorr 
-
 
ISI
 
And can you just help us when and why that happens.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It's a function of the assets in the deferred comp plans. So they move as the 
market moves and it therefore flows through revenue in comp and in 
essence as you can see we 
went through the impact on both businesses as 
you know that.
 
Glenn Shorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Okay. Do I need to care, meaning are they comparable amounts on the 
revenue and expense line and they net out to not a big impact.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes although by definition therefor
e implies a higher comp ratio but, yes 
they net out.
 
Glenn Shorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Understood. Okay, cool. Moving on, curious your comments about how 
you've extended the [rationale] book a little a bit, or a lot I should say, in 
the past but curious, [inaudible] your 
thoughts on NSFR, impact on prime 
brokerage, specifically in conjunction with the Feds recent comments on 
social and wholesale funding, just kind of how is it impacting, it's an 
important business for you, you're really good at it, how is it impacting how 
you run the business and the profitability of the business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So taking the two rules obviously both of which are at this point preliminary 
and we're looking forward to seeing the final rules. On the net stable funding 
ratio as you noted we freque
ntly said that durability of funding is important 
and it's the way we run the firm and as a result, probably not surprisingly 
we think having a measure of long
-
term durability is appropriate and we 
spent a lot of time as you noted achieving this durability
 
through proper ALM 

within our secured book.
 
The challenge of being more direct in answering your question is the rule is 

ake 
meaningful changes. And as I said we very much look forward to seeing 
what the rule is. And then on the city surcharge the increase for short term 
wholesale funding is somewhat similar given the fed has only provided the 
broad contours, so what the rul


 
I think obviously the entire industry has some elements of wholesale funding 

very much to 
your question. Our view is that logic would suggest that proper calibration 
would incorporate not just size but the quality and durability of funding in 
particular given the fed has recently published an article about durability in 
the industr



business here and I guess the last point 
I would make on the wholesale 
funding is we would hope the rule is dynamic and does adjust as the 
industry adjusts to the new rule.

Okay, last quickie is just your growth has been great in both 
--
 
as you not
ed 
in both the PLAs and the residential real estate loans. Are those FAs being 
--
 
especially incented to drive that. I know it comes at a higher profitability for 
the firm, does the low 
--
 
is the offset of the rates not going up for you guys 
low rates actu
ally help drive the growth in those lending products?
 
Ruth Porat
 

about loan growth is not on the comp credit, on the formulaic comp credit, 
so we call non
-
compensable revenue. So t




he number 
of financial advisors using the product. As they use it they see the value of 

infrastructure to support financial advisors and so they are seeing the 
strength of this product 

the security space lending, that loans so origination occurs and then you 
have to draw down over a period of time. So really what this is, is increased 
penetration on what is a very sizeable client base and 

driving it.

Street reducing the liquidity that it provides, we heard a lot more about it in 
the last few weeks of the third quarter and at the same 
time in the third 
quarter the [GSICs] began to have to make daily reports to regulators based 
on more current liquidity regs, do you think this may have had an impact 

impact of invent
ory and hedging or is the issue more broadly structural on 
your view?
 
Ruth Porat
 


reporting, people have been work
ing on that for quite some time and as you 
said it now started to be submitted to regulators. But when you look at the 
combination of the supplementary leverage ratio with the other various 

 
a number 
of factors which are really changing dynamics in the market liquidity in the 
market. At a recent conference I put up a slide that looks at the extent to 
which balance sheets have come down on the one hand and liquidity 
requirements have increased
 

squeezing the amount of balance sheet available for trading activities. So we 
do view that as a structural change in the industry driven by regulatory 
change in the aggregate.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 

fundamentally better spreads?
 
Ruth Porat
 

a positive for the market. I think that one of the things that has 
been 
concerning is the increase in treasury sales, which I think initially were 
attributed to the SLR and there was a view that potentially there would be a 
readjustment in markets but in fact through the course of the third quarter, 
even before the last c
ouple of weeks the trend line was up even when 
market volatility was low and I think that is a concern.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 

October. Obviously we are only a cou
ple of weeks in and they have been an 
unusual couple of weeks but certainly JPMorgan commented earlier this 
week that their markets businesses had seemed a lot more mixed over the 
last couple of weeks?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well as you said the macro environment, the
 
trading markets are really the 
key issue and it has been a challenge quarter to
-
date but as you 

comments we have seen this through the last several years, choppiness in 
markets and 

a choppy early start but when you look again across the franchise the 
investment banking pipeline is strong.
 
You have seen continued issuance throughout this period and yes a 
sustained down 

of deals but at this point the pipeline continues to build. In fact a lot of deals 
that we may have thought would close in the fourth quarter were pulled into 
the third quarter, were executed ea
rlier and the pipeline has replenished 
which really goes to the strength of the dialog across the banking franchise.
 
And similarly in wealth management what we are seeing, I appreciate you 
are asking about trading markets but as we look across our franchis


well.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Thanks. You mentioned the SLR and thanks for giving us the figure, is there 
still a [Sacker] type benefit that we should be look
ing for?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, there has been no update on the rule. We do still expect that [Sacker] 
will be a part of the standardized risk based capital calculation and as 
proposed based on the third quarter number that would be about a 30 basis 
point benefi

would include [Sacker] as part of it, if it would include it we would expect a 
modest benefit there.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Thanks. I had a question on wealth management. As you
 
pointed out the 
fee
-
based asset inflows at $6.5 billion were quite a bit lower than in either 
the reference quarters. I think you were $12.5 billion last quarter and $15 
billion a year ago and I was wondering if there is any color you can provide 
there, a
ny special factors that we should pay attention to?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No special factors. We have seen same strength in the business, it, in our 
view just reflects timing and as you noted we had strong flows throughout 
the year. So as we are looking at year
-
to
-
da
te we just had strong flows and 
there are timing issues.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Okay, and then I just have one more which is that you talked about the 
discrete tax benefit because of being able to repatriate more attractively 
than you had exp
ected in terms of your tax provisions. How unusual an 
event is just the repatriation itself and can you give us a sense for the order 
of magnitude involved and I guess what I am looking for is a signal as to 
what we are looking at in terms of potential cap
ital return?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of the repatriation as I noted it was due to some non
-
U.S. 
earnings that were at a cost lower than originally estimated, I think we look 
at requirements in geographic markets throughout the year, this one just 
happened t
o be with a benefit.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
And can you tell us sort of what the gross amount was that you repatriated?
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
Guy Moszkowski

Okay, fair 
enough. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.

Ruth Porat
 
Good morning.
 
Matt O'Conner 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
I 
was hoping just to follow
-
up on your comment about further capital actions 

process, earnings were higher, there has been more stability, so think about 
higher payouts or was the
re something else that you are referring to maybe 
related to selling the commodities business, bring up capital, things like 
that?
 
James P. Gorman
 

all the things going on at this
 
time we are obviously building pretty solid 
capital buffers. That said we live in a dynamic regulatory environment with 
potentially new G
-
SIFI buffers coming out but we feel strongly about where 
we are with our capital base and we feel strongly about wher
e we're going 
coming into the CCAR process. We certainly expect to continue to return 
capital to shareholders in increasing amounts over the coming years.
 
Matt O'Conner

Deutsche Bank
 
And then have you guys disclosed either the assets or revenue related t
o the 
commodities business, either what you sold or just the entire unit?
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
Matt O'Conner 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. And then just separately there was an article in the paper a couple of 
weeks ago related to the dividend 
arbitrage that some clients are using, that 
the US broker dealers and global broker dealers are helping. I am just 
wondering how big a business is that for you guys and remind us of the 
seasonality around that and thoughts on, I guess just the business goi
ng 
forward.
 
Ruth Porat
 
As we said repeatedly our equity business is strong, diversified across 
products and regions and that's what drives it. We don't break out particular 
pieces and there are seasonal patterns throughout the year.
 
Matt O'Conner 
-
 
Deutsch
e Bank
 
Okay, is that an area that you think you and others will pull back a little bit 
given just that it's being highlighted and maybe scrutinize a bit more than 
the past.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It is one of the number of services that we provide to clients and it's 
really 
based on client activity.
 
Matt O'Conner 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. And then just lastly the non
-
comp, I mean expenses overall actually 
came in pretty good this quarter in general. The non
-
comp in particular has 
been managed down quite nicely. Is 
there anything, I guess from here or 
more that you could do or should we think about this as a pretty reasonable 
run rate?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Our view is that there is more to do. We remain very focused on expenses 
overall and if you go back to 2012 when we first 
laid out our expense 
reduction goals we had an expense ratio at that time of about 84% and we 

-
to
-
date 
we're at 77% but the process of going over the last couple of years is really 
to provide 
the analytics, the tools, the dashboards to the businesses to 
ensure that engrained throughout the organization is a real focus on 
expenses and expense management and we view that as an ongoing part of 
the way we run the business.
 
As I talked about at a re
cent conference we divide our expenses into what 
we call run the bank and change the bank and we've been able to extract 
savings and run the bank to fund what we called change the bank 
requirements which include both regulatory requirements as well as ongo
ing 
innovation in the business, investments to ensure we're enhancing client 
experience and applications and across the platform. So again we got a very 
strict lens on that because it does create incremental capacity as well and 
we think it's the appropria
te way to run the overall franchise.
 
Matt O'Conner

Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. Thank you very much.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
 
James F. Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 
Thanks. Can you jus
t updates us on the FICC RWA this quarter and maybe 
just more strategically as we think outward if there is more pressure from 
regulators with the SIFI surcharge on top of a surcharge focused primarily 
on repo and other aspects of the fixed income business
, do you think that 
that there could be some changes in trying to push the RWA lower overtime. 
Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So risk weighted assets in fixed income are $191 billion this quarter, down 
from $192 billion last quarter. We just had less roll off this qua
rter and we 
remain very comfortable with the $180 billion target for fixed income which 
was originally end of 2016. We pulled it forward to end of 2015.
 
As I indicated at a recent conference we want to make it clear though that 
there not 
--
 
just as with th
e non
-
comp expense question there is not a line 
in the sand on a particular date or activity stops beyond the $180 billion. 
There is about $25 billion incremental risk weighted assets that run off 
overtime in areas like structured credit and long dated and
 
collateralized 
derivatives which generated a negative ROE because we have to finance 
positions, legacy positions and so as we exit we take those from a negative 
ROE to neutral and as we redeploy them you shift to a positive ROE and 
we're already generatin
g strong ROEs in a number of business within fixed 
income like credit and securitized products and so we have an opportunity to 
reallocate to get a higher return on those and that's really the way we're 
looking at what we're doing within fixed income.
 
As i
t relates to changing regulatory requirements and the potential 
surcharge, I would note that our ratios are very strong. The transitional ratio 


ly looking at is how to 
best optimize within each business to drive the ROE within each business 

do that.
 
James F. Mitchell 
-
 
Buckingham Research
 


sort of run off beyond that but you might be re
-
investing depending upon 
the environment. Is that the way to think about it?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yeah, depending on the environment and client activity because we have the 
opportunity already resident within a number of products, within fixed 
income to generate an attractive return. So depending on requirements 

 
James F. Mitchell

Ruth Porat

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA
 
Mike Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
Hi, what inning are you in, in redeploying the deposits that you achieved 
from the joint venture?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we are 
--
 
what inning, you frequently do ask the inning question. I think 

early days, I guess you would say even pre
-
game was building the 
infrastructure required to support 
the growth when once we closed out the 
acquisition and started onboarding the deposits. And so that a very 
important element of really the setup, ensuring that we had the 
infrastructure, the risk management, the banker supporting, the financial 
advisors. S
o that as the deposits started onboarding we could have positive 
growth, a good experience for our financial advisors as I already addressed 
and see the kind of roll
-

 

udent 
loan growth, prudent loan growth within wealth management and 
institutional securities and we have two broad franchises that enable us to 

growth and so we have ample capacity b

gap versus the industry average, but still believe we have ample capacity 
beyond here to grow and that is just with the contractual onboarding of 

contractual.
 
So we view this as the opportunity to have the [inaudible] depository 
embedded within Morgan Stanley that creates substantial incremental 

give it to James because he 
tends to like cricket matches and they last a lot 

 
James P. Gorman
 


 
around the bottom of the fourth in 
baseball and the afternoon tea session on day two of a five day test match.
 
Mike Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
Okay, how much do interest rates help if they increase and how much do 

e traditional banking 

you just help size the benefit or the harm?
 
Ruth Porat
 

the way we see the outlook 
for the bank. So overall rising rates are a good 
thing. They do benefit the bank if we deploy deposits into lending and AFS. 
And second, it should signal an improving economy which would increase 
activity levels across the franchise.
 
But the main point and
 
I tried to indicate that in the opening comments is 
that the main driver of NII growth is deposit deployment and you can see 
that in our year
-
over
-

legacies, city deposits and with more coming on board we 
have a positive 
impact even without rates rising. And so you take that 
--
 
that to us is really 

NII, again even without rates increasing.
 
So now you put to the other side at some poin
t rates will increase and for 

gone through this the giving you contractual deposit on
-
boarding kind of 
what the schedule is and what the current asset mix and what the target 
asset
 
mix is, is that you can model the rate impact whenever you do expect 
it to occur.
 

impact of higher rates on deposit outflows and the data suggests that for 
Morgan Stanley that would be
 
de minimis because our deposits, our working 

prior calls.
 
In terms of deposit pricing we model that based on historic data from both 
Morgan Stanley as well as for retail deposits
 
at regional and large money 
center banks, notwithstanding the fact that as I just said our deposits do 
behave very differently than those retail deposits and our analysis in our 
model would reflect about a 45 basis points increase in deposit pricing with 
the first hundred basis points increase in rates.
 
We do believe that is conservative given the nature of our deposits and 

kind of as something to put into a model. Fed funds is the m
ost relevant rate 
for our business and the last point is that the average duration of our bank 
assets is about 1.5 year. So rising rates do benefit us quickly. So the way we 

all
 
about asset optimization in a rising rate environment given the factors I 
went through and the cost structure of our bank, no bricks and mortar, the 
investments have already been made, any rise in rates does drops nicely to 
the bottom line.
 
Mike Mayo 
-
 
CL
SA
 
Just two quick follow
-
ups, the deposit data of 45% seem somewhat low 

not a whole lot of sensitivity there?
 
Ruth Porat
 

in given the 


first hundred basis points so it moves overtime.
 
Mike Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
And then low rates it sta
ys lower for longer, what impact does that have on 
your refinancing of your debt. You issued a lot of debt when your credit 

take advantage of that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We can and we have becaus

came on kind of came on in the 2010
-

overtime given the weighted average maturity of our unsecured debt is 
about six years. So we would lag into any benefits overtime but 
at this point

Good morning. A 
quick one first, the $141 million gain that you laid out, was

TransMontaigne?
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay, can you 
--
 
is it possible to 
quantify the TransMontaigne gain, was that 
significant?
 
Ruth Porat
 

as a reminder that also includes the contribution from our joint venture with 
NUFG for the real estate at [inau
dible] there is a number 
--
 

line items in that one.
 
Brennan Hawken

Okay, so I guess though given the fact that you broke it out would imply 

break out, is 
that fair?
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
All right, and then thinking about the rest of the physical business and the 

here by ye
ar
-
end can you start to shop the asset now, is there any sort of 
change that can be made proactively on that front?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well as you know and the way you framed the question the terms of the 

-
en
d the contract 

 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay, is it possible also, while on the physical commodity front to think 
about what growth rates might have been if we exclude either the 
TransMontaig
ne component of these physical commodities revenue out of 

 
Ruth Porat
 
So yeah, TransMontaigne would have been immaterial to the results, and as 
we indicated commodities overall was 
very low. It was down meaningfully 
year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-

produced in across commodities generally.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay, so it is possible that the growth rate might have been higher if we ex 
out the physic
al business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Right, and then one last one, just when we talk about the loan book a lot of 
times we focus on the wealth management and I'm just kind of curious you 
disclosed that always half of the loan growth is going t
o be coming from the 
institutional side. How should we think about the NII from those loans 
flowing through your P&L and generally how should we think about the 
spreads on those loans versus the loans in your wealth management 
business. Is there a way to s
ort of frame how to think about that side of the 
loan growth?
 
Ruth Porat
 


easy to parse through as in 
wealth management. Just to give you some loan 
growth numbers so in wealth management I think I indicated securities 
based
-
lendings up $2 billion, residentials up $1.5 billion and institutional 
securities we were up $1.5 billion on the quarter primarily in 
commercial real 
estate and we are focused continuing to build the diversified portfolio and 
our focus is on lending in areas where we have strong client franchise, 
strong domain knowledge.
 

erience 


accretive to the overall relationship. We have some slides that we have used 
in prior conferen
ces that give you yields on a blended basis.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay. And when we think about those yields and how that those yields play 
in my guess is or my sense should be that the level of competition in those 
markets is probably a bit more intense t
han you would see on the retail side. 
Is that a correct assumption or is that off base?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well again as I said part of it is on both sides wealth management and 
institutional securities what we are doing is really focused on our client base 
and in
 

key franchises. So that we view all of our businesses as competitive. We 

have got in our view a strong oppo
rtunity and what we said repeatedly is 

looking to originate volume merely to originate volume. There is a 
substantial opportunity within our client base on both sides of the house and 
th
e key lens as you have probably heard us say too many types prudent

some of the regulatory ratios, any update on the 
bank SLR or the LCR?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the bank, given we capitalize the bank to support the loan growth that I 
am pleased that we have been talking about a lot on this call, we are in a 

because we capitali
ze the bank to support what we expect will be ongoing 
loan growth.

Okay, and then small items, but just in terms of the tax outlook and then 
also the CVA, just wanted to find out, significant this quarter or 
kind of an 
average level?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of the first part of your question, overtime given our business 
mix the tax rate should be around 30% and then on CVA it was positive this 
quarter. It was a drag last quarter and last year but one point that
 
is worth 
noting is fixed income excluding commodities was up quarter
-
over
-
quarter 
and year
-
over
-
year and if you exclude CVA that same trend would apply. So 
the business fixed income products broadly excluding commodities up 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter and year
-
o
ver
-
year excluding CVA.

Okay, and then just on trading, so on commodities anything in the quarter 
that you would say was like a one
-

going into the fourth quarter and t
he next year and then I guess same thing 
on equities, just given the relative strength anything that you would say was 

 
Ruth Porat
 
No, so starting with commodities not 
--
 
nothing specific to call out a
nd so 
our view is that what we are looking at appears to be structural headwinds 
in certain commodities markets and as a result the key question is how to 
best maximize returns if in fact these are structural headwinds. And but 
there was nothing specific t
here and similarly in equities we had broad
-
based strength again across products and geographies just given the 
leadership in that business. We did benefit from a strong global underwriting 

ise and the 
strength of what we are doing in equity underwriting generally and the 
equity underwriting calendar remains strong but nothing specific to call out 
as broad
-
based strength again.

Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. Thanks a lo
t.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I guess just to add one of the things to note is that we have seen in the past 
that challenging result in overall poor performance. You often see 
reallocation but overall I think that one of the key things is typically activity 
slows as you g
o into the end of the year in particular with prime brokerage 
clients we've seen that in prior years.

The next question will come from Fiona Swaffield with RBC.

Hello. I just had two questions. Firstly was on just understanding the 
compensation ratio, sequentially a bit better because you took out the gain 
in your analysis on the pretax margins so I assume you should also do the 
same on the comp ra
tio and if we do that obviously has approved less, could 
you also explain this issue of the employee deferred comp and how that 
would affect the comp ratio sequentially? And the second question is on the 
SLR, could you talk a bit more about the balance she
et or the denominator, 
it obviously seems to have gone down which is helping and is there more 
prospect of that continuing. Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Certainly. So I am starting with the SLR 4.9% versus 4.6% last quarter. We 
had a contribution from both the numer
ator and denominator. The benefit 
on the denominator was actually primarily for mitigation of the gross up and 
so we've been talking for quite some time about the number of work 
streams against which we've been executing, including the net long CDS 
sold, t
he pickup in compression activities, the reductions in fixed income 
RWAs overtime and that was the bulk of the benefit that we saw on the 
denominator.
 
As you noted we also had a decrease in our GAAP balance sheet but the 
other items were a contributor to t
he benefit from the denominator. And 
then on the numerator beyond earnings we did have a prep issuance this 
past quarter. Those two drove the numerator higher. In fact the split 
between the numerator and the denominator was about two
-
thirds of the 
benefit 
came from the numerator, one
-
third came from the denominator.

The next question will come from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse
 
Thanks for taking my questions. Just quick one on FVA
, a number of your 
peers have now implemented this adjustment to [inaudible] of these books, 
curious on your latest thoughts on where Morgan Stanley stands on this.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So FVA referring obviously to fair value adjustments, refers to the potential 
im
plied financing cost for uncollateralized derivatives and only to the extent 
that those are observable, we do continue to evaluate it. As you noted there 
is a lot of industry discussion there has also been a lot of academic 
discussion on the topic but in o
ur view transparency continues to be lacking 
so there is no basis to take the adjustments.
 
Christian Bolu

Credit Suisse
 
Okay, and then quickly on VaR, that came down particularly interest rates, 
credit lines assume there was more connectivity during quar
ter, so just 
curious if you could parse out the decline debits we position in versus 
volatility.
 
Ruth Porat
 
It's come down, I think in line with overall, this activity level is coming 
down, we see it and you noted one line, I would say that in commodities 
it 
also came down so it was really just more in line with connectivity.

James, I appreciate your comments on your CCAR focus internally and 
clearly you made considerable progress delivering stronger return over the 
last four quarters and one thing I was little bit surpri
sed by just looking at 
your latest company run mid stress test is that your PPNR forecast of $8.3 
billion was it meaningfully different than your prior company run 
submissions? And I was wondering this merely reflects increased 
conservatism on your part in
 
an effort to maybe match the Feds historically 
conservative view of your PPNR profile and just given the progress that 
you've made over the last 12 months assuming no meaningful changes to 
the CCAR guidelines would you expect to see a better result this c
oming 
year?
 
James P. Gorman
 
Why don't I just take the top line for a minute on the better results this 
year? We didn't ask something that we didn't get last year so it's not like we 
have been restrictive, we have behaved according to what we thought was 
th
e right balance for the business and the right balance for capital action. So 
yes as we are accreting earnings which we have been doing throughout this 


 
process with a reasonably high degree of 
confidence again I think it has six goals around 
--
 
we would expect to have 
further action on the capital side.
 

proceeding on a plan that

perception of the PPNR in the 
-
 


--
 
one clear argue that 
the fed has been overly 

participants as well.
 
James P. Gorman
 

about it this year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we would agree
 


calculation was very counterintuitive, last year and our view is that another 
year of evidence, the benefit of the change in the busi
ness mix logically 
should help in last year it was the completion of the most strategic 
transformation of the acquisition of final piece of the wealth management 

consistency of earnings wit
h the acquisition.
 
So our view is that this is an iterative process that improves all parties have 
improvements throughout the course of time and it was counter intuitive and 

earnin

did think it was counterintuitive.

Nomura
 
No thanks, that commentary is extremely helpful and then just switching 
over this one quick question on preferreds. You issued t
he additional billion 

the 150 basis points of RWA target, others have contemplated, as has been 
mentioned by Basel, I'm just wondering at this juncture do you feel as 

re full on preferreds at the moment or should we anticipate 
additional issuance going forward?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We have no plans for more preferred issuance this year. Over the past few 

I
'm not going to close the door prominently but at this point no plans for 
preferred issuance this year.

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste, good morning and thank you everyone for joining us. In 
the second quarter 2014, we 
again grew our earnings on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis excluding DVA and excluding a discrete tax benefit in the quarter 
earnings increased 46%.
 
The fruits of our strategy were evident, with the stability of our wealth and 
asset management businesses providing 
significant ballast. The trust and 
partnership we have with our clients in investment banking and institutional 
equities offset historically low levels of volatility and reduced client activity. 
Our role has a strategic advisor for clients across our franc
hise including 
M&A, prime brokerage, credit, research and other deep content rich 
businesses positions us to benefit significantly from accelerating positive 
trends.
 
I will now take you through the six points we laid out for you in January. And 
then turn t
he call over to Ruth.
 
First, we continue to improve wealth management margins through cost 
discipline and revenue growth. For the first time since the acquisition from 
Citi, the remaining stake in the wealth management JV, we have achieved a 
greater than 2
0% margin in our wealth management business and record 
earnings since its inception of the joint venture.
 
We reached this level through a combination of revenue growth; our 
revenues grew 5% on a year
-
over
-
year basis despite reduced industry
-
wide 
transactio
n activity and continued expense discipline. We drove our non
-
compensation expenses down by 9% during the same period and our total 
expenses grew only 3%. We continue to expect to drive our margin to the 
22% to 25% target set for the end of 2015.
 
Second, w
e have improved our ROE in fixed income and commodities and 
continue to optimize that business to be appropriately sized for this firm. 
Although, our revenues excluding DVA were flat in the first half of 2014, we 
have also reduced average RWAs and expenses
 
thereby increasing ROE in 
this business year
-
to
-
date.
 
At the end of the second quarter 2014, our RWAs in fixed income and 
commodities were $192 billion. In addition to this systemic reduction of dead 
weight capital, more broadly, we have taken significant
 
steps in commodities 
to improve returns.
 
We closed on the sale of TransMontaigne on July 1st, the first of two physical 
oil businesses we are selling and continue to work towards closing the sale 
of the other physical business later this year. And as disc
ussed at our 
financials conference in early June, we are optimizing headcount and 
reducing grossed up balance sheet in fixed income, while maintaining a 
global franchise by leveraging our clearing and electronic capabilities. Our 
objective remains to deliv

attractive return for shareholders.
 
Third, we are driving additional expense reductions and improvements in our 
expense ratios. In the first half of 2014, we grew our expenses by 3%, while 

 
grew our revenu
es by 3% while keeping expenses flat. Our non
-
compensation expenses have declined while the firm
-
wide compensation 
ratio is also lower. In aggregate, overall expense ratios have improved from 
79% to 76% compared to the first half of 2013. We continue to se
e 
opportunities to increase efficiency through both tactical and strategic 
moves, investing in technology and systems that simplify our business and 
position us to better serve our clients.
 

specific 
growth output opportunities most notably in the bank. In the last several 
months, we drew new production records in both mortgages and securities 
based lending despite sluggish demand for mortgages across the industry. 
Our success has been driven 
by the relatively low penetration of our product 
within wealth management versus peer firms. We have seen a network 
effect build within our system as financial advisors use the products and find 
them effective for their clients; they discuss opportunities 
with additional 
clients, the successes of them being shared throughout the system leading 
to more activity.
 
As we have said before, lending growth will enhance the stability of revenue 
and earnings for the firm as a whole and make our client relationships 
deeper and stickier. Of great importance to us, however, is that we grow our 
banks in a prudent and measured fashion. We have known since 2009 that 
we would have a very significant deposit base. And we spent the last five 
years investing in risk management
, technology and client service.
 
Turning to the fifth point. We continue to steadily increase capital return to 
shareholders. We discussed our plans for capital returns with you on our last 
call in extensive detail. And we remain committed to increasing re
turns over 
time subject of course to regulatory approval. Of note, a key driver of capital 
returns are stable and consistent earnings, which we continue to 
demonstrate this quarter.
 
Finally, we are working towards achieving returns in excess of our cost of
 
capital and of course, subject to our capital returns. We did achieve our 
target of 10% this quarter that was obviously flattered by the discrete tax 
benefit. However, excluding DVA in the first half of this year and last year 
and excluding the tax benefi
t of this quarter, our underlying ROE was still 
higher. Of greater significance, we demonstrated improved performance and 
momentum in many areas across the firm that are important to driving our 
ROEs sustainably higher including the following.
 
One, in inve
stment banking, we had a very strong quarter driven by the 
strength in our underwriting and advisory franchises. Two, we continue to 
drive industry leading results in institutional equities despite lower market 
volumes around the world and this is due to t
he depth and breadth of our 
franchise and the partnership we have built with our clients over many 
years.
 
Thirdly, we drive our wealth management 

 
we drove our wealth 
management margin higher even in a relatively subdued transaction 
environment. We also r
eached importantly $2 trillion in client assets a 
tremendous achievement a more than 3x the assets we held in 2006 on 
behalf of our clients.
 
Fourthly, our relative performance in fixed income was solid and we made 
progress towards one of our last strategic
 
business change objectives with 
the closing on the sale of TransMontaigne on July 1st.
 
Fifthly, we also successfully raised our first major post Dodd
-
Frank merchant 
banking fund in Asia. This was coming in ahead of our expectations with 
significant instit
utional representation and with the decidedly less firm 
capital versus earlier funds. And finally, as Ruth will discuss in more detail, 
we increased our pro forma SLR estimate under the U.S. proposed rule to 
4.6% up from 4.2% last quarter.
 
I will now turn 
the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in more detail and 
look forward to your questions at the end. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the 
effective DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the
 
footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures. The impact of DVA 
in the quarter was positive $87 million with $50 million in fixed income sales 
and trading and $37 million in equity sales and trading.
 
Excluding the impact of DVA f
irm
-
wide revenues were $8.5 billion down 3% 
versus the first quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for 
the second quarter was 1.6% reflecting a discrete tax benefit of $609 million 
or $0.31 per diluted share principally related to the 
remeasurement of 
reserves and related interest.
 
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders excluding DVA were $1.8 billion. Earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share excluding DVA are $0.91 after prefer
red 
dividends. On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA firm
-
wide revenues 
for the quarter were $8.6 billion. Earnings from continuing operations 
applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.9 billion. 
Reported earnings from continuing opera
tions per diluted share were $0.94 
after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $33.48 
per share and tangible book value was $28.53 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $827 billion at June 30 
down modestly 
from $831 billion at the end of the first quarter. Deposits as 
of quarter end were $118 billion up $1 billion versus Q1.
 
Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $192 billion compared 
with $203 billion at the end of the first quarter. The declin
e was primarily 
driven by the deployment of excess cash from deposit into loans which 
reduces our bank liquidity and is consistent with the bank strategy we laid 
out previously.
 
Turning to capital, this quarter the required Basel reporting regime moved to 
a Basel III advanced denominator whereas last quarter the required 
denominator was based on Basel I plus 2.5. In both quarters, the 
numerators calculated based on the transitional Basel III rule. Although our 
calculations are not final, we believe that our
 
common equity Tier
-
1 
transitional ratio will be approximately 13.8% and our Tier
-
1 capital ratio 
under this regime will be approximately 15.2%.
 
Basel III transitional risk
-
weighted assets are expected to be approximately 
$423 billion at June 30, reflecting our best estimate of the final set of 
reserve rules, our pro forma common equity Tier
-
1 ratio using Basel III 
fully
-
phased in advanced approach
 
was 12.1% at June 30 up from 11.6% in 
1Q.
 
Our pro form standardized ratio was 10.8% up from 10.2% in 1Q. Pro forma 
fully
-
phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately 
$431 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage rati
o under 
the U.S. regulatory proposal to be approximately 4.6% at June 30 up from 
4.2% at the end of the first quarter. These estimates are preliminary and are 
subject to revision. We continue to expect to exceed the required 5% level in 
2015 including an a
ssumption for increasing returns of capital to 
shareholders.
 
Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion flat 
versus the first quarter. Compensation expense was down 2% versus the 
prior quarter. Non
-
compensation expense was $2.4 
billion up 5% reflecting 
seasonal trends.
 
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In institutional securities 
revenues excluding DVA were $4.2 billion down 8% sequentially. Non
-
interest expense was $3.2 billion down 1% versus the first quarter. 
Compen
sation was $1.7 billion for the second quarter down versus the first 
quarter on lower revenue reflecting a 41% ratio excluding DVA.
 
Non
-
compensation expense for the second quarter was $1.5 billion up 
versus the first quarter also reflecting seasonality. Th
e business reported a 
pretax profit of $927 million excluding the impact of DVA including the 
impact of DVA revenues were $4.2 billion and pretax profit was $1 billion.
 
In investment banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 26% versus last 
quarter reflecti
ng broad
-
based strength across products and regions with 
substantial growth in EMEA. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley 
ranked number 2 in global announced in completed M&A and number 3 in 
global IPOs at the end of the second quarter.
 
Notable tra
nsactions included in advisory, Morgan Stanley is acting as 
defense advisor to Shire in its discussions with AbbVie regarding a potential 
$55 billion combination. Morgan Stanley also acted as lead financial advisor 
and lead left arranger on the bridge fina
ncing for Tyson Foods in its $8.6 
billion acquisition of Hillshire brand.
 
In equity underwriting, we again evidenced the strength of our global 
franchise notable deals include acting as joined global coordinator and joint 
book runner; we priced a $3.5 bill
ion capital increase for the National Bank 
of Greece. And Morgan Stanley successfully executed a $1.3 billion 
unregistered block trade of YPSSA amongst other international offerings.
 
In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as global coordinator on the 
s
uccessful $40 billion consent solicitation of debt securities for Pemex 
Finance. In addition, acting as joint book runner, the firm sourced $9.9 
billion of debtor in possession financing for Energy Future Holdings.
 
Morgan Stanley and its partner Bank of To
kyo, Mitsubishi UFJ played a 
leading role in structuring underwriting and syndicating the debt facilities. 
Advisory revenues of $418 million increased 24% versus our first quarter 
results due primarily to increased activity with particular strength in EMEA
 
and Asia Pacific.
 
Underwriting revenues of $1 billion increased 27% versus our first quarter 
results driven by equity underwriting revenues of $489 million which were 
up 55% versus the first quarter on higher issuance volumes in the strong 
market and a me
aningful uptick in EMEA. Fixed income underwriting 
revenues were $525 million higher versus the first quarter primarily driven 
by higher investment grade and high yield volume.
 
Equity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.8 billion, an 
increase 
of 5% from last quarter. Prime brokerage revenues were up 
reflecting the benefit of increased client balances and the dividend season. 
Cash revenues remained resilient against declines in market volumes across 
regions. Derivatives revenues were down as low
er volatility reduced client 
activity.
 
Fixed income and commodities, sales and trading revenues excluding DVA 
were $1 billion down sequentially driven impart by typical seasonality. 
Commodities revenues were down substantially from a very strong 1Q. 
Outsid
e of commodities revenues in most product areas declined due to 
lower volatility which resulted in lower client activity.
 
In contrast, rates revenues were modestly higher quarter
-
over
-
quarter due 
to improvements in both the United States and EMEA. CVA cont
inued to be a 
drag in the quarter due to the tightening of our credit spreads. Average 
trading VAR for the second quarter was $48 million down slightly to the first 
quarter.
 
Turning to wealth management, revenues were $3.7 billion in the second 
quarter up 
3% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.1 billion 
were up versus last quarter reflecting the benefit of higher market levels and 
positive flows. Transaction revenues were essentially flat to last quarter 
consisting primarily of commissions of $511
 
million down 5% versus the 
prior quarter due to lower activity consistent with lower exchange volumes.
 
Investment banking related fees of $213 million up 18% versus last quarter 
reflecting higher equity and preferred stock underwriting activity. And 
tradi
ng revenues of $267 million down 3% versus the first quarter reflecting 
a decrease in fixed income trading partially offset by higher returns on 
deferred compensation plans.
 
Net interest revenue increased 7% to $578 million driven primarily by higher 
reven
ues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our 
lending product.
 
Non
-
interest expense was $2.9 billion flat versus last quarter. Non
-
compensation expense was $762 million also flat to last quarter. The 
compensation ratio was 59% down versus t
he first quarter driven by 
seasonal trends. The PVT margin was 21%. Profit before tax was $767 
million; total client asset surpassed $2 trillion.
 
Global fee
-
based asset inflows were $12.5 billion. Fee
-
based assets under 
management increased to a record $76
2 billion at quarter end representing 
38% of client assets. Global representatives were 16,316 essentially flat to 
the first quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $127 billion 
down versus the first quarter due primarily to outflows related to 
tax season. 
Approximately $109 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.
 
Our wealth management lending balances continue to grow reflecting the 
ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Our PLA balances increased $1.9 
billion and mortgage balances increased
 
$1.6 billion. Production in the 
second quarter was at record levels for both products.
 
Investment management revenues of $692 million were down 6% 
sequentially predominantly driven by the deconsolidation of certain legal 
entities associated with a real es
tate fund sponsored by the firm.
 
A number of years ago, we provided a liquidity facility for the fund and not 
have to consolidate revenues and capital. The liquidity facility has expired. 
Accordingly certain legal entities associated with the fund were 
dec
onsolidated.
 
The deconsolidation eliminates the related revenue as well as a portion of 
our non
-
controlling interest and is net income neutral. Additionally, the 
deconsolidation reduces both balance sheet and risk
-
weighted assets. In 
traditional asset mana
gement, revenues of $436 million were flat to the first 
quarter. In real estate investing revenues of $111 million were down 15% 
driven by the deconsolidation.
 
Merchant banking revenues were $145 million down 16% driven by lower 
gains in investments. Non
-
i
nterest expenses were $487 million up 2% from 
the first quarter. The compensation ratio was 42% up versus the first 
quarter driven primarily by the revenue impact of the deconsolidation. Non
-
compensation expense was $196 million up from $192 million in the
 
first 
quarter. Profit before tax was $205 million down 22% sequentially due to 
the deconsolidation. NCI was $7 million versus $54 million last quarter again 
driven by the deconsolidation.
 
Total assets under management increased to $396 billion driven by m
arket 
appreciation and positive flows. We also successfully completed a fund 
raising for Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia IV in the quarter, our first 
major post Dodd
-
Frank fund raising effort.
 
Turning to our outlook. While June was stronger than the fir
st two months of 
the quarter recognizing the trading markets remain uncertain, we are on the 
view that it is too early to determine conditions for the balance 

 
rest of the 
year. However, we see strength and opportunities across our businesses 
with several
 
encouraging trends.
 
First, M&A volumes remain strong with a healthy backlog and growth in 
larger transactions which is our sweet spot. Last quarter, we discussed three 
catalysts for heightened M&A activity and they remain. Healthy corporate, 
cross border 
and activist activity suggesting M&A will remain vibrant.
 
Second, financing markets remain receptive with a strong pipeline in equity 
underwriting and a positive outlook for debt underwriting benefiting from 
M&A activity. Third, we are seeing an increase i
n activity in Europe. The 
second quarter was the strongest in Europe since the beginning of 2012 with 
notable improvement in both investment banking and fixed income product. 
Given the strength and breadth of our corporate and institutional client 
relation
ship, we are well
-
positioned to benefit from these trends and are 
focused on delivering for our clients.
 
More specific to Morgan Stanley, we are also increasingly seeing the fruits of 
the many steps we have taken during the last five years to better 
position 
the firm with retail wins worth noting.
 
First, we continue to benefit from lending growth which is supported by our 
leading client franchises in both wealth management and institutional 
securities. Given the scale of each of these franchises, we h
ave ample 
opportunities with our existing clients while maintaining tight credit 
standards. As evidenced by the growth in our funded loan book again this 
quarter, we continue to execute against this opportunity and they remain 
significant upside. We are pr
udently building a balanced portfolio on our way 
to being the 10th largest depository in the U.S.
 
Second, as discussed before wealth management continues to deliver higher 
profitability with growing revenues on a higher PVT margin. Now, with 100% 
ownership
 
of the wealth management business the operating leverage 
translates into a growing contribution to the firm.
 
Finally, the outperformance of our cash bond spreads enable us to finance 
the firm more efficiently that over time of course will result in additi
onal 
upside.
 
Thank you for listening, James and I will now take your questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Guy Moszkowski 
with Autonomous Research.
 
Guy Moszkowski

Autonomous Research
 
Goo
d morning. I was wondering if you could clarify how you treat something 

the derivatives books of the market businesses. I think everyone is pretty 
clear in the industry now about c

gets very consistent treatment and in particular since we are also focused on 
how FIC and equities are trending. Just want to make sure that I understand 
how you treat CVA and how much of your credit spreads swings
 
might have 
impacted FIC particular in regard to CVA this quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as much as we call out DVA and talk about revenues excluding DVA 
because that does not flow through to capital. CVA does and so it goes right 
to the P&L. So when we discussed 
our fixed income and commodities 
revenues, it reflects the impact of CVA into your point, firms do it differently, 
but it does reflect at Morgan Stanley the impact of CVA and given the 
meaningful spread tightening we had in particular year
-
over
-

 
pretty notable. So for example, year
-
over
-
year our fixed income business 
was up in all major products except foreign exchange, however, given this 
spread tightening we had a big drag in CVA and if you exclude the impact to 
CVA, our fixed income and commod
ities business actually would have been 
up.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Got it. And was the impact much more in FIC than in equities?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Okay. Thanks. Also just to pick up on something else that yo
u mentioned, I 
think to recall that in years passed like before the last couple of years your 
prime brokerage business did a very strong seasonal business in European 
dividend arm in the second quarter in particular. Can you give us a sense of 
how much tha
t might have contributed in the second quarter this year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we 

 
that does continue to be a benefit in the second quarter and again, 
along with the strength we had in PV more broadly with growth in revenues 
clients and client balances we contin
ue to benefit from the seasonality. So if 
you look at year
-
over
-
year performance in equities that would normalize for 
what is continues to be a second quarter seasonal event.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research
 
Got it. Thanks. Okay. One more question whic
h is really more on capital, you 
moved equity capital looks like from the parent into the business unit couple 
of billion dollars on the average in the institutional about $500 million in 
investment management which is a fairly sizeable percentage increase
 
for 
that business. Is this also because of the regime change that you talked 
about in terms of going to the Basel III or is there something else going on 
there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
You nailed it. The way we disclose the allocation of capital across the various 
bus
inesses is based on the capital regime in place at that point in time. And 
so this quarter as a result of yet another regime change both the numerator 
and denominator are under Basel III transitional. Last quarter the 
denominator was Basel I plus 2.5. This

The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Good morning. So quick question first on the $1.92 billion RWA in fixed does 
that include TransMontaigne?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We closed TransMontaigne as of July 1. And so that would include 

 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Perfect. Can you help us think about how much that might help reduce that
 
number in 2Q or in 3Q rather? Excuse me.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So that 

 
so TransMontaigne is about $2 billion of risk
-
weighted assets and 
there is also a modest liquidity benefit.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Great. Thanks. So we noticed that deposits in the bank 

 
deposit
 
program 
fell this quarter, was that seasonal and can you help us think about that this 

prior years. So was there anything unusual going on there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So firm
-
wide, the dep

then the parent and we have had the onboarding of deposits from Citi. So 
the deposits overall were up $1 billion, $5 billion from contractual 
onboarding deposits the tier point that was offset by the
 
typical season 
outflows for tax payments. Tax payments were actually greater than 
outflows and what we saw was increasing use of PLA or securities based 

fourth quarter deposits
 
tend to be higher due to year end selling.
 
And then on the flip side, we see deposits going down some in the second 
quarter with tax payment. So net
-
net year
-
end selling and tax payments due 
tend to even each other out over the period but what you are see
ing here is 
the second quarter seasonality.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Great. And then just clarifying because I got a handful of questions about it 

And if we look down at the footnote, 

that went from 108 to 109 this quarter. So the rate slowed but it is still was 
headed in an upward direction, correct?
 
Ruth Porat
 
In the wealth management line?
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Right.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, wealth manage
ment went down right.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Perfect, okay. And then also on the comps and the wealth management 
business, is it possible to think about how much of that is from the 
amortization of forgivable loans written to recruit brokers because the past
 
several years we have gone through sort of elevated recruiting environment. 
And if we think about, I think maybe James made some comments at the 
Morgan Stanley FIC conference about how recruiting in competition maybe 
moderating a bit. And so if we think a
bout turnover staying at current levels, 
is it possible that you guys can help us think about to wealth management 
comp over time?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, let me give you a couple of pieces. So the comp ratio is down this 
quarter and that reflects typical first q

typically down it was here. The reason we are guiding down to the 55% or 
lower comp ratio over time really goes to the growth in net interest income 
and the execution of our bank strategy and the tremendous operating 
l
everage we have as we continue to deploy deposits into lending product.
 
And so if you again, looking at the overall business where we will be driving 
it to 55% or lower because the margin on that product 
--
 
lending product is 
as pretty significant and the 
lending product does not on the same formulaic 
comp grid. So I think if you are trying to gauge where is the comp ratio 
going, the biggest driver of that will be NII and the growth in lending 
product.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Sure.
 
James Gorman
 
Hey, 
Brenan just to separate it. I think your issue was around the 
amortization also of the deals in addition to what Ruth just described.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Yes.
 
James Gorman
 
Long
-
term strategically in an oligopoly structure you would expect there 
would be l

translate yet into the financials. But over the long
-
term we think it will.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay. Great. Are you were exactly right Jim, I was kind of 

 
I completely get 
the NII and how th

therefore should help the comp. I just was hoping to try to get at maybe 
some of that amortization. So I guess, the only color you guys gave is over 
the longer run assuming competition stays down that s
hould also help as a 
tailwind overall as well to.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. It will.
 
Brennan Hawken 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay. And then last one from me 

 
touched on it a bit prior but prime 
brokerage was definitely a positive, you hit on seasonality, but as you said 
when we loo
k year
-
over
-
year that should normalize for the seasonality and 
you guys were flat which in this quarter flat is the new up. So maybe could 
you help us in parsing out maybe any other benefits that you might have 
had and was it mostly in prime brokerage and 
aside from seasonality were 
there any drivers and tailwinds there?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We talked about for many quarters this is a stellar franchise. They have had 

franchise across products and
 
geographies we often talk about managing it, 
leading it across the nine
-
box strategy with the product cash. Derivatives 
and PV on the one
-
hand and the regions of the world Americas, EMEA and 
Asia on the other dimension and looking for leadership and deliv
ering for 
clients within each of those boxes and then looking at opportunities to build 
adjacencies across those various boxes. We had strength this quarter led by 
prime brokerage as I noted already with growth in revenues clients and 
client balances.
 
And 
then in terms of cash products we continue to have strong performance 
in cash. We do believe we took wallet share there. We had good client 
engagement in index rebalancing. Derivatives was a bit lower on the back of 

 
strong franchise that continues to 
deliver.
 
Brennan Hawken

Your next question will come from Mike Mayo with 
CLSA.
 
Mike Mayo

CLSA
 
Hi. Ruth, you mentioned you are moving to leverage your status as the 10th 
largest depositor in the U.S. and looking at the bank data from call reports it 

yo
u should just look at the bank in isolation. Also if we look at the 
information in your package today, it looks a loan to deposit ratio of 39% or 
so. If you could just confirm whether this is at least one way to look at your 
company and to highlight where 

ratio or the ROA of the bank?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So what we try to lay out in a number of presentations is the contractual 
growth in deposits where we are in terms of asset mix. And as you look over 
time how we look to deploy those deposits moving more from cash until 
lending products. And clearly the yi
eld today continues to be pretty low 
given where we are still over weighting cash, philosophically the way we are 
looking at it is deposit growth is going to support lending is supporting 
lending in both institutional securities and wealth management both 
are 
leading franchises with a large base of untapped clients. And we have a very 
strong opportunity therefore to continue to build out a nice diversified asset 
mix here. And while maintaining strong credit standards.
 
So I think if you look at the decks tha
t we put out, you will see where the 
yield on that should go over time. There is a lot of noise in the call reports 
that directionally it would give you sense of the mix between these two 
franchises wealth management and institutional securities.
 
Mike Mayo

CLSA
 
How much would Morgan Stanley benefit if interest rates increase by 100 

think you guys have articulated in that way?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Quite meaningfully, I mean what we have ar
ticulated is, the comp structure 
in the bank and so again, we are a best portfolio continues to be very short 
duration and as we are looking at continuing to deploy deposits into lending 
products the rising rate environments quite meaningfully the margin i
n the 
bank given we have no bricks and mortar, we have no customer acquisition 
cost because we are really lending to our existing client base which is not 
only a cost benefit but a credit risk management benefit. We have already 
built the infrastructure to
 
support the loan growth and I have already 

the bank has a very high margin rising rates to be significant.
 
What we did in the deck that I have already alluded to as we indicated 
wh
ere we were at a point in time and just following the forward yield curve 
what kind of lift you would see in the yield if you are just following the 
forward yield curve. And what we tried to do is give you all of the various 
levers so between the bond boar
ding and deposits the current mix of assets, 
the deployment plan over time, you can talk about how you want.
 
Mike Mayo 
-
 
CLSA
 
And then lastly, James, you gave a comment, it was almost an aside, in 
talking about your ROE targets saying well perhaps 15% ROE 
is possible 
some day and it was the first time I heard you say that 15% would even be 

a nice stretch from where you are now? But did you say that and why did 
you mention that you f
eel more positive about the outlook or is it just a 
hypothetical one day sort of statement.
 
James Gorman
 
I think the time that I said that was in the context of what was available for 
the industry. And this has been an industry Mike as you know where ROEs 
have 20 plus percent were the norm. You double the capital, you shrink the 
balance sheet and unless you create new businesses you are 20 plus percent 
ROE immediately dropped to sub 5% which is exactly what happened with 
the industry.
 
The industry is now wo
rking its way back to 10% ROEs through buybacks 
more efficient capital usage for the balance sheet management. And in our 
case building diverse businesses that use less capital and obviously 
contribute to our ROE. So I think 

 
I certainly not making an imm
ediate 
projection this is sort of a stage field where the industry is going, is it 



 

rt of framing it now. You will draw your own conclusions about 

institutions and I think your point about the bank you just asked Ruth about 
is exactly at sort of strategic core part of 
the next evolution of this firm is to 
develop $130 billion deposit bank within Morgan Stanley which is a very 

done with prudence as respect to lending. But it will be done. And i
t will be 
done over several years.
 
Mike Mayo

CLSA
 
Just if you have a superior business mix that should eventually mean a 
superior ROE otherwise it might not be a superior business mix. So at some 
point with higher rates, is it possible Morgan 
Stanley could get an ROE of 
15% or so?
 
James Gorman
 
You know, there is a great old phrase of a journey with thousands miles 
begins with a single step. And we are working our way towards 10% when 
we get there we will have another conversation with you.

Firstly, a fir
st quick question on the investment management business Ruth. 
In the investment management business, the core asset management fee 
line was up 10% linked quarter, which is a little bit surprising just given AUM 
growth was closer to 4. Any color you have on
 

appreciated.
 
Ruth Porat
 
We have continued to execute on the business. We had good flows in the 
business. Have been investing in, in distribution. You can see flows were up 
across the broad in traditional asset 
management. And I think that the team 
continues to execute well.
 
Christian Bolu 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay. Got it. James on the wealth management business I mean first of all 
congratulations on getting to the $2 trillion club. While asset growth has 
been strong
 
both financial advisor head count and branch growth have been 
more muted. I appreciate your focus in that business has been on an 
increasing productivity and efficiency. That said, I would be curious if you 
guys actually have plans to grow your core advis
or base and locations going 
forward?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as we have talked about for quite some time we are focused on 
productivity and quality of FAs rather than just sheer number in it and in fact 
have over time reduced the lower productivity financial advisor
s we feel very 
good in and around this level. We are not managing to a specific number 
and as it relates to the number of locations that we have. We have had an 
opportunity in particular post closing the acquisition of the joint venture to 
look at places w
here we could consolidate offices within major cities.
 

off, the question is within any particular area is there logic in combining an 
office where you have a fully staffed office w
ith a great culture working 

offices together that may not be the most effective for clients or the best 
experience for financial advisor. So we reduced the number of locations 
quite a 
bit over the last couple of years, I think the big bulk of the 
opportunity we really achieved there and now you will see ones and twos 
depending on any particular market. But no plans, we feel good about where 
we are.
 
Christian Bolu

Credit Suisse
 
Okay. T
hanks. And then lastly from me, just on the prime business you 
spoke a lot today. Just curious if you 

 
what you are hearing from the clients 
in terms of pricing trends just given the implications for supplementary 
leverage ratio across the industry?
 
Ruth 
Porat
 
We are starting to hear some peers are repricing balance sheet as it affects 
this business and fixed income product as well very much to your point as a 
result of the SLR.

Your next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson 
Humphrey.
 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
 

looking at the slide that you 
and James put out for the update in January, 

help me understand kind of what the approximate contribution of these 
categories were to the 40 basis point improvement sequentially?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The biggest driver then taking it from 4.2% last quarter to 4.6% this quarter 
was the numerator that was most of the improvement and that was due to 
the combined benefit from earnings of the preferred issuance we did early in 
the quarter, the m
ultiplier effect with DTA and investment capacity 
deductions. We talked about previously. We continue to focus on mitigating 
some of the other numerator deduction. And then the remaining 
improvement is from the denominator items that we talked about previo
usly. 
Some ongoing compression, RWAs were obviously down in fixed income 
where you see the PFE grows up. Some mitigation just early days of 
mitigating the net long CDS sold in some modest balance sheet reduction. 
But the overwhelming the majority of it was
 
in the numerator and we are 
executing the opportunities now in the denominator.
 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
 
And is there any change to the guidance given at that point of those various 
benefits generating 188 around 200 basis points of p
otential improvement?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, the rules change now the inclusion of net long CDS sold and we have 
obviously had a big move in the ratio from 4.2% to 4.6%. We feel very 
comfortable with greater than 5% in 2015 with higher returns of capital 
which m
ay not surprise you even we are sitting here at 4.6% today. And as I 
said, across the various work stream we are continuing to execute to reduce 
PFE where it makes sense while still supporting our client activity and client 
franchise. There are certain are
as 
--
 


effective to reduce the overall PFE through compression activities and we are 
executing there. The pace is strong. We have accomplished a lot year
-
to
-
date the protocol around it has improved. And so we expect the pace will 
continue to be good. So we are continuing to execute against each of these, 
the mix may change a bit as we have added now net long CDS sold 
mitigation as an added opportunity given t
he role change.
 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
 
Great. And if I can just transition quickly on page 7 of the supplements in 
the other funded loans category, which I recognize is small relative to the 
balance sheet but up very significantly. A
nd I think the footnote suggest that 

the strategy behind growing a purchased loan portfolio?
 
Ruth Porat
 

across wealth management and institutional securities is really executing 
with our clients and areas where we have a strong franchise, strong client 
base domain expertise. And so within institutional securities it is an area 
consistent with what we have di
scussed today. I talked about it as small 
fleet across a number of different areas including commercial real estate 

the increase in funded loan balances up about $5 billion which i
s as you said 

an example of commercial real estate with a 20
-
year track record that 
leadership with a really high quality franchise there and we have history 
originating loans
 
outside the bank. We are now doing more in the bank but 
we are targeting very much our client base in areas where we have domain 
expertise.
 
Eric Wasserstrom

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey

out on 
legal costs suggests that they were de minimis in the period?

That there was no call out on legal cost suggest that they were low in the

Glenn Schorr

ISI
 
Hi. Thanks. Ruth, you mentioned lower funding cost earl

they have gone down a lot. How should we think about how long it takes to 
work its way through, is it really just inverse of maybe the average maturity. 
So in other words you get a 15% to 20% of that benefit each year as your 
debt rose?
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
Okay. And so that could 

 

needle in the firms overall earnings on a year
-
by
-
year basis?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. Our view is, you have seen real compr
ession across the industry but we 
outperformed peers. And I think that our view is that it reflects all that we 
have done over the last number of years to reposition both the business mix 
and the balance sheet. And so we view it as another tailwind that wi
ll leg 

rising rate environment on a relative basis given our spreads have come in 
more than peers.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 

already addressed it 
pieces across the other questions but are there 

 
you mentioned bits and 
pieces of repricing or attempts to repricing prime brokerage. Maybe a 
broader question of how you think SLR is mostly impacting the big banks 
and brokers are impa
cting the markets and how it will impact how you do 
your balance sheet planning?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, we do think it continues to be the way of constraint for banks on both 
sides of the Atlantic and you are seeing the reduction of balance sheet in 
lower return
 
assets. And as I noticed some peers are repricing balance sheet 
using a harsher lens on allocation of balance sheet. So we are seeing wider 
bit offer in certain financing markets. There was some dislocation in treasury 
sales which we see as transitory. An
d the fed prevented additional 
dislocation with the by
-
side using the RRP program prevented a more painful 
readjustment period but you are seeing the impact kind of ripple through in 
a number of different ways.
 
Glenn Schorr 
-
 
ISI
 
But sounds like a lot of t
hat stuff has made its way through in other words 

your mouth, I realize?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I think you are still seeing an evolution here. I would agree for example on 
treasury sales we 
view that as transitory. But as firms reposition where they 
are using balance sheet and putting balance sheet behind client activities I 
think it continues to evolve in particular given some of the requirements for 
the European banks. We feel good about wh
ere we are because we have 

important way we think about our business given the changes that we made 
over the last several years with the strength of wealth management. The 
lens that w
e have on balance sheet within fixed income going back 
sometimes now. We feel we taken the steps, we need to take and have 
clarity about the execution path within fixed income equities continue to be 
performing as it consistently as and we have opportuniti
es to support our 
banking clients with the growth in lending products. So we feel good about 

industry.

a
 
Hi. Good morning.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Steve Chubak 
-
 
Nomura
 
So I had a follow
-
up question on operating leverage at the bank and well, I 
was hoping to clarify when we go through the modeling process for wealth 
management ea
rnings and higher rate scenario. The implied comp ratio that 
we derive is actually closer to the 

 
outside of very low 50s. So about 300 to 
500 basis points that are 
--
 
than your stated target of 55%. And I was 
wondering whether your mid
-
50 target contempl
ates the benefit from higher 
rates. And maybe even in that same vein where do you see operating 
margins peaking in a more normalized rate back drop?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the 55% comp ratio and the PVT margin guidance of 22% to 25% 
assumes the flat rate 
environment. And we specifically did that so that you 
could model in your outlook for a rising rate environment. But very much to 
your point there is tremendous operating leverage in a rising rate 
environment for the wealth management business. And through
out that the 
growth in that lending book and through what we were doing in the FS 
portfolio. So there is upside and you will see that flow through as rates rise 
and will let you forecast when that happens.
 
Steve Chubak 
-
 
Nomura
 
Okay, great. And just switch
ing gears for a moment or two. I have a capital 
question pertaining to FIC and just an in effort to help us better monitor 
your ongoing FIC ROE progress under all the different binding constraints 
had exist today. It would be really helpful if you could he
lp clarify the 
current level of required capital as measured under the SLR to support the 
FIC business specifically. And also given how proactive you have been on the 
mitigation front, how you should think about required capital levels trending 
over the ne
xt couple of years.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we have broken out a lot of detail here in particular risk weighted assets 
within institutional securities breaking it down to the fixed income level. So if 
you get a sense of what 

 
the progress we are making in that busi
ness you 


required capital separately we are breaking out lot of the components of the 
various capital ra
tios and the leverage ratio and are on good path forward to 
this greater than 5%.
 
Steve Chubak 
-
 
Nomura
 
Okay. And there has been any change to I guess is roughly $5 billion plus or 
minus of FIC revenues that were required to achieve your targeted 10% ROE 
w
ithin FIC, presumably it would be a little bit lower just given that you have 
been more proactive once again on the mitigation front?
 
Ruth Porat
 

multiple levers to get their 
between revenues expenses and capital. But, as 
an example couple of quarters ago when I was talking about our 
commodities business, the physical oil commodities businesses that we were 
selling, they have revenues that are PBT break
-
even with some capital t
ied 


we said we want to be very clear we are not looking at revenues 

 
revenue 
sake we are looking at
 

itself and when we talk about our fixed income business we are looking at a 
return on capital greater than 10% within fixed income and moving in that 

returns of the firm. And 
I talk about this often on these calls but it is key within investment banking 
yet again this quarter we had over $500 million of fixed income underwriting 
revenues which is accretive to those client relationship with our clients a
re 
looking forward from us but really does benefit from the execution 
capabilities within fixed income.
 
And similarly within our wealth management business our clients want fixed 
income product, municipal product, more specifically, and that benefits from 
the strength of what we have within fixed income. But we are holding fixed 
income to a standard like all of our businesses of generating an appropriate 
return on capital and systematically doing using each one of those levers to 
drive to a higher return an

other businesses benefits the bottom line.

Our final question will 
come from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
 
Michael Carrier 
-
 
Bank of America
 
Thanks. Just one quick last one. When we think about the outlook on the 
Institutional Securities business, and this is either James or Ruth. Can you 
give us some sense, I gue
ss two parts, just on the Investment Banking side 
given the pipeline of M&A, when 

 
from a timing standpoint, when a lot of 
those things will close once announced? And any other revenues that can 
shoot off from there.
 
And then on the trading side of the bu
siness, we're used to normal 
seasonality based on the last 20 years. Given that the business has changed 
and firms have restructured some parts of it, has anything changed on that 
front, whether it's because of client mix or because of its product mix that
 
we see less seasonality than we have in the past?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So starting with the first part on M&A and closing and implications for 
revenues if you look through the year, it does. And obviously varies 
depending upon the nature of the deal, the industry, 
the regulatory 
approvals required so it can be from a month to many months, think 3 to 9 
months indicate that they can cut across a number of different periods.
 
And typically much as a financing is done towards the latter end of that as 
you are closing alt
hough there can be some hedging activity up front. I think 
the main point that is encouraging as the pipeline continues to be very 
healthy across all products and in M&A, I noted the momentum with these 
key drivers across board or corporate activity and ac
tivist activity and now 
we are seeing larger deals. But probably one of the most additional 
encouraging elements for the team is that the velocity of deals has really 
picked up as well in other words if you go back a year or two we talked a lot 
about a hea

into execution and being announced whereas now what you are seeing is 
much greater clarity and velocity going from identification of a strategic 
opportunity to announcement and execution t
hat velocity we think is 
encouraging and the underwriting calendar does remain strong globally, it 
remain strong in particular the equity side outside of the U.S.
 
So that should be 

 
that should give us again all things equal some 
momentum going through th
e balance of the year. And then on the trading 

whether that have legs to it given most of this year we saw lower trading 
volumes, lower volatility. And so bit of a pick up in 
June is not something I 
would say is fair to extrapolate from here. And as you pointed out summer 
seasonality is in front of us. Whether the trends change over time and 
trading businesses as a result of regulatory requirements tough to say I 
think the one

James Gorman
 
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I will 
keep my 

results are relatively straight forward. This is the second quarter, the firm 
generated revenues in excess of $10 billion. We achieved the return on 
equity of 13% and a return on tangible equ
ity of approximately 15%. 
Institutional securities continued to demonstrate leadership in areas of 
traditional strength. Investment banking and equities reported very strong 
results and fixed income continued to perform well.
 
Wealth management remained sol
id. The segment generated a pre
-
tax 
margin of approximately 27%, while continuing to invest in the business. 
Our technological capabilities have evolved from an exploratory phase in the 
tangible tools that aim to enhance FA productivity, streamline operati
ons 
and support further asset growth. Investment management attracted long
-
term inflows for the sixth consecutive quarter. Additionally, we successfully 
integrated Mesa West over the quarter, complementing our unique platform 
of alternative and traditional
 
products. John will walk through the financials 
in more detail shortly.
 

eighth year of the CCAR stress test. Each year, the test has become 
increasingly more demanding and in fa
ct has yielded results significantly 
more severe than what we and many other banks experienced during the 
2008 global financial crisis.
 
There have been important reasons to increase the severity of the test over 
time, ensuring the safety and soundness of t
he large institutions and 
decreasing systemic risk of the U.S. financial system. At Morgan Stanley, 
capital as expressed by our CET
-
1 and total capital ratios is strong, both on 
absolute and relative basis.
 
Several institutions including Morgan Stanley wer
e provided the option to 

just that, keeping aggregate distributions the same as in 2017 but we 
changed our mix slightly. We increased our dividend to $0.30 per quarter, 
reflecti
ng our confidence in the stability of the firm, and lowered our 
buyback commensurately to accommodate the dividend.
 
We will not get ahead of our sales in predicting what the Fed will do next 
year, but 2018 appears to be a transition year. Going forward, we
 
expect to 
be able to continue to invest in our business and offer our shareholders an 
attractive capital return while maintaining a prudent capital base.
 
Now, as we look forward, we fully expect the third quarter to experience the 
seasonality common to th
e summer months. But as we all know, the near
-
term landscape can change quickly. Whatever transpires this quarter, we 
remain confident in the medium term goals we laid out at the beginning of 
the year and are well on track with each of them.
 

the call over to Jon.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you and good morning.
 
Second quarter results were strong. We reported revenues of $10.6 billion. 
Year
-
to
-
date revenues were $21.7 billion, a firm record after excluding the 
impact of DVA in prior periods. Second 
quarter diluted EPS was $1.30, ROE 
was 13%, and return on tangible common equity was 14.9%. Institutional 
securities displayed strength across the segment. Investment banking 
performed very well as new issue markets remained open and receptive to 
corporate
 
strategic activity. Equity sales and trading was buoyed by active 
global markets and fixed income benefitted from strong client flow. We 
delivered solid results across wealth and investment management, our 
sources of more stable revenues.
 
Total non
-
intere
st expense was $7.5 billion in the quarter. On a year
-
to
-
date 
basis, our efficiency ratio was 70%, an almost 200 basis
-
point improvement 
compared to the same period last year. This improvement reflects operating 
leverage across both compensation and non
-
co
mp expenses. In addition to 
the impacts from revenue recognition accounting, increased expenses have 
primarily been driven by higher compensation and execution related costs 
associated with higher revenues. Discretionary spending has been well
-
controlled. 
And this discipline has allowed us to continue to make 
investments across the firm, especially in technology.
 
Now, to the businesses. Institutional securities generated revenues of $5.7 
million in the second quarter. Continued strength across investment 
ba
nking, equities and fixed income has contributed to year
-
to
-
date revenues 
of $11.8 billion, our strongest first half of the year excluding DVA since 2007 
and a 19% increase versus the same period last year. Non
-
compensation 
expenses were $1.9 billion for t
he quarter, a 4% sequential increase, driven 
by higher professional services expenses. Compensation expenses were $2 
billion, representing a compensation to net revenue ratio of 34.9.
 
In investment banking, all products and regions performed well, generati
ng 
revenues of $1.7 billion. The results represented 12% increase versus the 
strong first quarter. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $618 million, up 
8% sequentially. M&A volumes have continued at record levels, supported 
by larger strategic transacti
on and cross
-
border activity. Clients remain 
engaged and pipelines are healthy.
 
New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter with 
significant investor demand across both equity and fixed income, supporting 
strong underwriting results. Equi
ty underwriting revenues of $541 million 
were up 29% sequentially as favorable backdrop allowed us to convert a 
strong IPO backlog and convertible activity also remained robust. Clients in 
Asia continue to be active including a number of larger IPOs in the
 
quarter.
 
Fixed income underwriting results increased 4% sequentially to $540 million 
with stable results across both high
-
yield and investment grade issuance. 
Whereas the effects of U.S. tax reform and rising rates have weighed on 
investment grade flow is
suance, this has been more than offset by increased 
strategic financings. We believe this benefits our franchise which is more 
oriented towards non
-
commoditized debt products and activity.
 
Investment banking pipelines remained constructive across products 
and 
regions. Both, advisory and underwriting revenues should benefit from the 
elevated level of strategic activity in the year so far. However, given the 
continued macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, we are watching 
markets for volatility that ma
y slow future issuance.
 

one globally. Revenues were $2.5 billion with strong results across all 
regions, particularly Europe. Prime brokerage revenue saw sequential 
increase, aided
 
by seasonal factors in Europe and stable client balances. 
Derivatives and cash revenues remained robust, although lower than in Q1 
as market volatility and global volumes trended lower.
 
Fixed income continued to perform well with quarterly revenues of $1.
4 
billion. Each business lines saw sequential decline versus a very strong Q1, 
but divisional revenues were up 12% year
-
over
-
year. Seasonality and a 
decrease in rate volatility, particularly in the latter part of the quarter, 
contributed to the sequential 
decline.
 
In our macro business, we saw strong client activity in FX. Rate was 
impacted by range
-
bound yields in the second half of the quarter.
 
Our credit businesses performed well as activity remained robust, despite 
widening credit spreads. Our instituti
onal lending franchise also continues to 
grow as we provide financing across a wide range of asset classes globally.
 
In commodities, revenues were down due to a fewer structured transactions 
which can be episodic. Fixed income strength has been supported b
y deeper 
relationships and better client activity. The business continues to build on its 
gains and we are encouraged by its momentum. Average trading VAR for the 
period was $44 million, down from $46 million in the first quarter, driven 
principally by low
er volatility.
 
Now, turning to wealth management. Revenues were $4.3 billion for the 
quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by slowdown 
in transactional revenues. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, however, revenues of 
$8.7 million are up 6%. For
 
the quarter, despite the slight revenue decrease, 

-
tax profit remained at $1.2 billion. This resulted in a PBT 
margin of 26.8%, a new high, post JV. The business continues to 
demonstrate strong operating leverage. Year
-
to
-
date revenue gro
wth has 
been twice the rate of expense growth and has translated into pre
-
tax profit 
growth of 14%. Both non
-
comp and comp expenses have contributed to this 
margin expansion.
 
Total client assets of $2.4 trillion is up 2% compared to last quarter. Net fee
-
b
ased flows remained strong at $15 billion, contributing to record fee
-
based 
assets of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets. Asset management 
revenues were $2.5 billion. Positive flows were partially offset by the first 

 
Net interest income was $1 billion for the 
quarter, down 2% sequentially, driven primarily by lower prepayment 
amortization gains.
 
Year
-
to
-
date NII of $2.1 billion represents a 5% increase. Higher NII year
-
to
-
date reflects continued growth in balances and
 
higher yields, which has 
been partially offset by increase in funding costs as we continue to diversify 
our funding base. In the quarter, we initiated a redesign of our cash sweep 
program in an effort to simplify our larger client sweep options. The initi
al 
phases of redesign became effective at the end of the quarter, resulting in 
approximately $10 billion of incremental sweep deposits. This increase was 
partially offset by outflows in the quarter, primarily driven by tax season and 
continued market deplo
yment. Additional changes scheduled to be 
implemented in the third quarter are expected to generate a similar amount 
of sweep deposits. Rates on these incremental balances will be in line with 
the current money fund sweeps. Whilst lending in the U.S. banks
 
grew by 
2% to $70 billion in the seasonally strong quarter as client choose their SBL 
lines to manage liquidity through the tax season, year
-
over
-
year, loans have 
grown approximately 8%.
 
Following a strong first quarter, retail engagement declined in 
the second 
quarter. A flatter yield curve has also shifted clients investing into shorter 
duration products at lower commission rates. Consequently, transactional 
revenues of $691 million were down 7%, sequentially. This quarter results 
demonstrate stabili
ty and health of our wealth business. Despite some 
headwinds faced by the segment this quarter, pre
-
tax profit remained near 
record levels. Fundamentals remained strong.
 
Our sources of annuitized revenues continue to grow with consistent fee
-
based flows an
d record balances for both fee
-
based assets and loans. 
Additionally, we believe our investments to create a modern client and FA 
experience supported by integrated digital capabilities will enhance growth 
and further operating leverage over time.
 
Investmen
t management witnessed another solid quarter with a continuation 
of positive long
-
term flows. Revenues were $691 million, a 4% decline 
relative to last quarter. Asset management fees of $610 million were down 
3% sequentially. Year
-
over
-
year, revenue has gr
own 13%, driven by 
continued strong investment performance and positive flows, particularly in 
our active fundamental equity and multi
-
asset strategies. Investment 
revenues were $55 million, down 29%, sequentially. Investment 
performance continues to be so
lid, but we did see volatilities in markets and 
FX and our Asia Pacific funds in particular.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. On a sequential basis, total spot assets of 
$876 billion were up $17 billion, driven by increases in liquidity. Our 
standardized RWAs
 
are expected to remain relatively unchanged at $388 
billion. Our Basel III standardized common equity Tier 1 and supplementary 
leverage ratios are expected to increase to 15.8 and 6.4% respectively as 
we accredited capital in the quarter. During the secon
d quarter, we 
repurchased approximately $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 
24 million shares and our Board declared a $0.30 dividend per share, up 
from $0.25 per share.
 
Our tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6%, reflecting $88 million of 
int
ermittent net discrete tax benefits. For the remainder of the year, we 
continue to expect our tax rate to be at the upper end of our 22 to 25% full 
year guidance. Our first half results have been strong with two consecutive 
quarters with revenues greater t
han $10 billion. All of our businesses are 
positioned for growth and to support our clients if activity levels remain high.
 
Near term, we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown. And of course 
there are number of uncertainties that may impact investor
 
sentiment. Trade 
tensions, political uncertainties across Europe and the potential for an 
inverted yield curve to name a few are factors that remain in play. However, 
as we have demonstrated before, as long as markets are opening and 
functioning and bouts
 
of volatility do not give way to client inactivity, we feel 
confident that we will achieve our medium term targets.
 
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questi
on comes from the line of 
Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is now open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 

area across both trading and banking that I feel like there is room for you to 
improve towar

you think about the opportunities, given your relationships with the 

perspective?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. Listen, from an o

with the results. As I mentioned earlier, there has been some pockets of 

with our overall positions, Glenn. And when we think abou
t our risk profile 

happy with the results.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. How about 
--
 
on the net issues income front and wealth management, 
I think down sequentially for two quarters. Balance
s are growing, loans are 
growing, clients are growing, rates are up. I wonder if we could talk towards 
the 
--
 
what you mentioned about diversifying your funding base, what 
exactly it is, how much of that is the CD promo that you guys did and then 
how much 
of the flat curve is having an impact?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. And there is a lot of moving pieces obviously and this is the wealth 
management segment. But year
-
to
-
date, as I mentioned, I think I 
mentioned net interest income is up 5%. So, good growth year
-
o
ver
-
year, 
which I think is a better metric to look at. Clearly, quarter
-
over
-
quarter we 
saw a slight tick down, some of that is driven by the prepayments I 

are up, as you said given o
ur mix profile and the rate moves but that has 
been offset by the rising interest expense related to the diversification of the 
deposits. I would describe our sort of ALM position as sort of modestly asset 
sensitive at this point in the segment. So, growth
 
is going to continue to 
come from balanced growth on the asset side. And we do expect to continue 

growing it year
-
to
-
date.
 
So, the diversification impact is really away from the sweep d
eposits that 
generally have a lower costs into savings and CDs. The proportion of CDs 
are now much higher percentage than what they were clearly a year ago. 

sweep redesign has al
so had an impact on the interest expense. So, there is 
a lot of different moving parts. But, I would say the growth is really going to 
come from balanced growth as opposed to rate movements going forward in 
this segment.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. I appreciate. Ju

comes in from people that bring in new money. Right? In another words, 

bring more balances to their Morgan Stanley relations
hip?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, certainly in the wealth management channel, the new CD promotional 


a lot of those 




 
generally been redeployed 
mostly back into their investment accounts in both fixed income and equity. 
So, it stays within the system. We do also raise CDs outside of the network 

 
stability of the mix.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski, 
Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Thanks. Moszkowski, but I guess you guys know that.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Good morning, Guy.
 
Guy 
Moszkowski
 

So, your deposits for the institution are up about $12 billion or so, linked 

lending and com
mitment 
--
 
the balance sheet lending commitments up 

about the seeps adding another $10 billion probably as you implement the 
next phase in 3Q. Just help us think a little bit 
from a very big picture point 


 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

step back fo
r a second. So, if you look at the disclosure, the U.S. bank 
deposits are up about $13 billion. I would categorize them really in three 
buckets. One, you mentioned the diversification of the product offering really 
promotional CDs and savings as well as we
 
continue to roll out new 

now in a few complexes. So, we continue to try to modify our product 
offerings. But that bucket, if you will, is up about $2 billion this quarter. The 
sweep
 
deposits are also up about $2 billion. You mentioned we did sweep in 
--
 
that change caused the sweep in of about $9 billion or so. But we saw 
outflows, both going to tax payments and redeployment into the market, so 
that net impact is about 2. And then, t
he third channel, as I mentioned, is a 
wholesale source CDs. We actually were pretty active in that space this 
quarter. And that number is up about $9 billion. A couple of things there. As 
I mentioned, we do have a couple of big promotional rates CD offeri
ngs that 
we ran through the system last year rolling off. So, we want to get ahead of 
that as our expectation is a lot of that money, some will stay in deposits, but 
a lot of that will get reinvested into the market. And we wanted to be in 
advance of that.
 
So, we had the appropriate amount of liquidity to continue 
to fund both the wealth channel and the ISG lending growth.
 
So, those three components make up to $13 billion, not all of that is wealth 
sourced and not all of that goes to support the wealth busi
ness. We see a 
continuation of clients making investment choices of how they want to 
deploy their cash. They had been putting it more into the longer term fixed 

at or near its all
-
time lows and percentage in equities is at or near its all 

away from the sweet deposits, which are lowest cost funding source into 
some of these more higher cost products, and t

drive interest expense going forward.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 

Thank you for that. Changing the subject a little bit. James opened up with 
some comments on CCAR.
 
And I was wondering, if you could help us 
summarize what your thinking is with respect to moving forward towards the 

that, and how it might interact with your ability to return capit
al?
 
James Gorman
 


period where the stress test scenarios were extremely tough. And for the 
eighth year, they
 
go sort of got tougher each year, but this year, they got 

trying to figure out what is the right level of capital you need in the financial 
system to fund the economic growth a

institutions. And I think, we have the comment period on ECB [ph] buffer 

thing is the recognition that the capital that truly matters is risk weighted 
capital. Leverage ratios are important to sort of one instrument. But in terms 

much more important, you leverage treasuries or illiquid investments.
 
So, I think, as I said in t

I think we should let 
--
 
the Fed is going through this process. And I think we 



$6.8 billion of capital through the first six months of this year, I believe 

$6.8 billion this year. So, we continue to create excess capital under
 
just this 


 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP 
Securities. Y
our line is now open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Hey. Good morning. I guess, first question here just on the retention loans 
and wealth management where I think the balance was $3.6 billion at last 

 

external recruiting being more modest. And so, as we get closer to the 
Smith Barney retention piece rolling off next year, is the expectation still 
that the vast majority of that is going
 
to drop to pre
-
tax? And then, when we 
think about the non
-
Smith Barney piece, which is actually the majority, are 


the moving part 

 
James Gorman
 

But generally speaking, the retention notes amortize over a long period
 
of 

Smith Barney clearly gives us optionality that continue to invest in the 
franchise. But again, our expectation is that will allow us to improve the 
overall margin in the busi
ness. I would say the trend over the seven or eight 
years has been that recruiting 
--
 
not only is recruiting being going down but 
the size of retention packages have also been going down. So, this 
acceleration or deceleration of amortization expenses actua
lly already have 
been happening over the last couple of years. And we will get to a period, 
although albeit over time that that number will become actually reasonably 
stable as we have slowed down the recruiting and the attrition has also 
slowed down. So a

peak amortization periods in the old notes. We have this cliff event in 
January. And both of those things will be 
--
 
allow us real flexibility to 
continue to invest in the business as well as showi
ng operating leverage.
 
Devin Ryan
 

-
up here just on 
the EMEA revenues, nice step up sequentially and year

over

year. And I 
know the equities in that region could be strong this quarter. But, maybe 
if 


and just confluence of moving parts that you mentioned on trade retentions 
and Brexit. So, just
 
level of bit more maybe detail on the outlook as well just 
by the businesses?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. And I think you mentioned it. The real strength in EMEA this quarter 
was both in our equities business where there is some seasonality as well as 
in our in
vestment banking business. And quarter

levels, but there has been good activity levels
 
and good flows right now and 

 
James Gorman
 
I think, to me, the important takeaway is this business is very global and we 
are extremely well positioned where it matters around the world. Our 
partnership in Japa
n is very positive. The franchise we have across Europe, 
and yes, we saw some sort of idiosyncratic moves to that this quarter but 
the franchise is very strong. Brazil, Mexico very strong, and obviously China 
--
 
Greater China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia 
all very well represented. 
So, this was a moment when EMEA kind of popped a little bit, which was 
great, but Asia was less strong this quarter relative to the other regions. But

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of 
UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up 
on th
e recruiting question that Devin asked. Have you seen 
--
 

probably a little over six months since you guys have exited broker protocol. 

indicated in the past the desire t
o emphasize recruiting less. Have you seen 
any impact from that? Where is the market for FA recruiting at this point? 
Are you seeing competitors step up as far as competition for Morgan Stanley 
FAs? Any color on that will be great.
 
James Gorman
 
Why 

years? The fundamental shift in this industry was the consolidation of firms. 
So, instead of recruiting in 10 different firms, in our case, Kidder, Hutton, 
Shearson, Lehman, Dean Witte
r, Reynolds, Robi Humphrey, Legg Mason, we 

--
 
the competitive group that would be recruiting in and out from all these 
firms in this kind of crazy weekly event that went on. And n
ow there is 

each other is 
--
 


with that. 


 
Now, that said, there is obviously the independent advisory channel where 
some people move to. There is always that
 
prospect of somebody setting up 

the quality of the research, the capability of technology, the extensive 
compliance, all of these things lead people to want to be part of an 
ins

result, we are doing very little recruiting. We like growing in

house. And 

proposition.
 
Brennan Hawken
 

the tech investments that you guys made. So, I wanted to transition for the 
follow

up and a non
-
comp grew sequentially this quarter, both in wealth and 
in ISG. Was there any noise 
in that line? I know, we 
--
 
you guys had 
highlighted I believe BC&E last quarter. Volumes were lower, but maybe 
there was some incremental tech invest. How should we think about that 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. Listen, 
Brennan, I think quarter
-
over
-
quarter comparisons have some 
seasonality. There is marketing and business development. You highlighted 

trading volumes are up and down, as a result you

But I think the right way to think about it is just more of a year

you can capture that six

Our next question will 
be from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Your 
line is now open.
 
Mike Mayo
 

results are result of what I would call repositioning 1.0. You restructured 

 
through. You had Smith Barney. You have the fee
-
based assets and the high margin equities benefit from the strength of 


tion is, do you need a 
repositioning 2.0 and it might seem ironic since results are among the best 


now, a lot of
 
your peers are doing all sorts of more aggressive strategic 

lot more branches or your competitor has a new CEO. So, it seems like the 
pace of strategic change at your competi
tors is now interestingly faster than 
the pace of your strategic change.
 

really the question is, when you look out over the next several years, what 
are the areas of greatest strategi
c change? And I get your tech expo, which 

headed.
 
James Gorman
 

a little bit a few of the layers. I thi
nk describing it as sort of 1.0 is not really 
accurate. I mean, we probably made more strategic change to this 
institution the last five or eight years than we made in the previous 80. We 
had a wealth management business in 2006 that had revenues of $5 bil
lion 
and pre
-

$17 billion to $18 billion and pre
-
tax profits of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. So 




 
We have risk weighted assets in fixed income of I think $380 billion; we had 
a balance sheet of $1.2 trillion; we had capital of $30 billion. I mean, on 
every measure, this is
 
a very, very different profile firm. And our revenues 


out.
 
So that to me is a lot of strategic change i
n a very short period of time for a 
company of this size and complexity. I think, it is unwise to run strategy 
through envy. Every other institution has to do what they do based upon 
their own capabilities, their own DNA, their own particular challenges. I
 

--
 
I never presume just because somebody announces the 

matters is things that create material change to institutions, and doing that 
to regulated banks of 40 billion 
in revenue size is hard. And our job is to 

newspapers about stuff. But we feel compelled direct because we see 
opportunities, which we can prosecute and believe we can deliver great 
b

investment in technology and thank you for the comment about the tech 

both, wealth management, the trading busi

on.
 
The potential for growing revenues in asset management given the 
diversification of the base, the range of products and the alternative space 
and the traditional space and the performance of that business is real. The 
sha



strategy and also respecting the qu
estions that came earlier around net 
interest income, the bank will remain a very important source of growth over 
many years; and then, our geographic repositioning, particularly in Asia 

. So, 

about it, which is fine. I care about results. And a huge amount going on still 



strategy? I said, what about make some money. Our job is to deliver for our 
shareholders and not to try and mimic what others do. We do what we think 
is right for Morgan Stanley.
 
Mike Mayo
 

l. So, if you had 80 years of change in the last eight years, I 
guess my follow up is your appetite for deals, your appetite to more

ankly investing in technology

love to do things that we are confident we can absorb. I believe in being 
very aggressive when you see an opportunity that is right in your 
wheelhouse and
 
being very cautious when you see things that our 
extensions into new space. And that will be our philosophy on deal making. 
But, I think for any of the big banks to engage on large scale transactions is 
probably a premature is my guess at this point. But 
small scale things that 

thing is we just see a lot of growth across our businesses and a lot of our

Thank you. 
Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from 
RBC. Your line is now open.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys give us some color? You had some 
really good loan growth in the institutional securities bank data on slide 12. 
Co
rporate loans are up about 36%, year

growth is coming from? How much is leverage loans? And also, can you talk 
about underwriting standards? Are the

that business. You see that in the corporate loan line. Corporate lending is 
generally a relationship in the ba

commitment side, continued growth in that area. And again, that will be

over

quarter. But broadly 

gr
owth opportunities. Virtually, all of that 
--
 
not virtually, all of that is 


business.
 
Specifically arou
nd even, a lot of activity this quarter. Little bit more skewed 
to LBO activity, but basically our backlog or our pipeline is generally on a 
percentage basis more skewed to larger strategic investment grade deals. 
But, there has been some more activity on 
the LBO front pipes, still very 
good velocity in terms of our ability to distribute and syndicate. We have 
seen a little bit of repricing in the risk base, particularly in the high
-
yield, 
more so in leverage loans. But again, liquidity is deep. The CLO mar
kets are 

been repriced for the new risk metrics, if you will. And the deals that are in 

flex. So, we
 
still feel very good about that.
 
I would say, the market seems a little bit more selective. And good deals are 
still getting done well, but we have seen some other deals struggle a little 
bit, not necessarily in our portfolio. And then, to the last commen
t, we have 
not changed our underwriting standards. We are still very
-
disciplined in that 
space and we will continue to be so, going forward.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Thank you. I appreciate it. And as a follow
-

addressed this. Can 
you share with us, just speaking the pipelines, your 
pipeline, the backlogs and ECM and DCM and advisory, where do they stand 
in the second quarter versus how they were in the first quarter?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, I would describe, all of our pipelines tha
t are three pipelines that you 
just highlighted as very healthy and constructive. And in the first six 

the advisory space or in the underwriting space. And so, we feel very good 
abo
ut the pipelines. Uncertainty levels and volatility levels will impact our 

impact from any of the headlines year

to

date.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of 
Marty Mosby of Vining 
Sparks. Your line is now open.
 
Marty Mosby
 
Thanks. Maybe a smaller issue. But one of our analyses actually highlighted 
that yield on your securities portfolio was one of the lowest amongst the 
large cap banks. Is there any way for you
 
to be able to take advantage of 
where 
--
 
at least where current market rates are and be able to either 
maybe extend duration or not even extend duration just current two bonds 
that create a little bit higher yield in that portfolio?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I woul


redesigns brought in a lot of cash at the end of the period. But again, I think 

 
our portfolio and the risk 
characteristics of it. If there are opportunities to incrementally get more 


re
turns.
 
Marty Mosby
 
And then, just, if you look at 
--
 
there was a recovery from prior charge
-
off, 
where is the location of that in the income statement?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
The location of that in the income statement would be in other revenues in 
ISG is where 
you would see it, which is obviously part of that that line item. 
But we did have a previously charged off energy loan, fully charged off that 
we were able to sell until we took a recovery, but we also took it through the 
negative or had a release of a neg
ative provision line, so it dropped to the 
bottom
-
line.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America. 
Your line is now open.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Just a question on the wealth management business. So, you guys 
highlighted
 

the past few years. Just wanted to give your sense, when that starts to 

bringing in new clients, new assets, improv
ing efficiency over time. But over 
the next few years, is that is all kind of in place? What are goals from these 
investments?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I would say that you sort of highlighted what our expectations are. 

echnology help drive FA advice and 

expectation is it will be useful tools to help our FAs work with their clients 
and potentially bring in some of the assets that they hold the wa
y. We would 


change within the business, these trends are going to play out over a 
significant number of years. 
And we would expect to get good growth and 
good efficiency from them.
 
Michael Carrier
 


consistent in equi
ties and in fixed than some of the peers. I just wanted to 
get your sense on either client traction, products. And then probably more 

seem more consistent than a lot of the peers in
 
the industry?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

good diversification among clients, so not a lot of concentrations. And this is 
across both equities and fixed income. We continue to invest in the
 
footprint 
and relationship managers and we continue to see good productivity from 


really driven based
 
on our client relationships and client activity and clients 
flows.

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham 
Research. Your line is now open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Maybe we can just circle back to the SCB and DFAST. I think obvio
usly this 
year is not necessarily indicative of what happens next year and I get all 
that. But you guys have consistently had kind of one of the biggest volatility 
in the DFAST, from beginning to trough, yet it seems laid out, you made 
major changes to the
 
franchise over 50% from wealth and asset 
management. Is there 
--
 

still high and is there anything you can do to kind of reduce the DFAST 
stress test volatility going forward? Any thoughts on how to handl
e that will 
be great.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I mean, I think your observations are very similar to ours. First of all, 
these models were designed for an entire industry, not just for our business 
mix. So, I think there is some calibration to the 
business model, as well as 

transparency, so we can better understand the models because they do set 

w

based on our own models.
 
We do have a very large wealth management business in sales and trading 
practices which are sensitive to the securities and equities markets. So, just 
as a fa
ctual matter, the decline is driven by the equity path or a significant 
portion is driven by the equity path. As last year, as you know, it was down 
65% market that stayed down and that will have an impact. But I think our 
expectation is that there will be
 
some changes here coming forward. But as 

comments around more tailored supervision. We do think that there are 
some elements of our business that might not be perfectly captured in the 

results in the other banks, you have PPNR results that are multiple 
--
 
Fed 
models are multiples of what the banks get. So, this is not a Morgan Stanley 
issue. The test was designed for
 
the entire industry and it served its 
purpose. It reestablished credibility and confidence in the financial system 


ahead of 
them but we are looking forward to some sort of sensible changes.
 
The only last comment I would make is, even though our trough 
--
 
peak to 
trough decline has been generally larger than most of our peers, we had 
been able to offer our clients 
--
 
or
 
excuse me, our shareholders an attractive 
return profile. And we would expect to be able to do that in the future as 
well.
 
James Gorman
 
I guess, I would just add three things. Number one, I think Jon hit on 
something very important that the sort of equiti
es profile of the wealth 



a
ppreciated over time in the way the models are constructed under the 
stress test. If you just look at the stability of that business quarter
-
after
-


 
Numb
er two, as I said earlier, I think just taking a simplistic leverage ratio 
or supplemental leverage ratio and putting it at the same level as the core 
capital risk
-

public about that and obviou
sly had discussions with the previous regime at 
the Fed about it and the current regime. And there is a lot of sympathy for 
taking a look at that.
 

balance sheet during a period of f
inancial distress when assets are actually 
shrinking value. And the only way you really do it I think is through 

like this.
 
So, those three things are pretty important, meaty t
hings that really matter, 
and we will see how all this plays out over the next year or so. I think, the 
Fed 
--
 


ke a 
fresh look at whether there are certain things that are in balance relative to 

figure out the next one.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Okay. Those are all fair points. Thanks. And just maybe a f
ollow
-
up on the 
wealth management side. I think you guys have talked about mortgage as 
an important product to penetrate wealth management client base. But, if I 
look at year
-
over
-

-
over
-
year. Is t
here 
--
 

opportunity to increase that? Just any color will be great.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I think the couple of points. Yes, rising rates is one factor. But I think 
more importantly is that we had an 
outside vendor doing origination 
fulfillment prior. We actually built our own system and brought that in
-
house. And that transition period, we are now fully off of the old provider. 
And we are now fully on all applications, are going through our new system
. 


shorter churn times. So, I think that that change is going to be net positive. 
But as we transitioned from t
he old platform to the new platform, we 
obviously were very sensitive to the customer experience and effectively 
slowed down that business. We now have the rate movements, but we do 
expect to get more growth going forward. And we do still think that there 
is 
opportunities within our existing client base for that product.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu of 
Bernstein. Your line is now open.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Good morning, guys. Just particularly on the sweep changes th

made to the deposit program. So, I guess $20 billion, 10 from this quarter 
--
 
10 from last quarter and 10 going forward. Is that it or is there more that 
you think you can generate after that?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, again, from the redesign itself, t

--
 
and 

balances usually get swept at the $2 million level and now at a $20 million 
level. So, from the sweep redesign change, the August slug will
 
be the last 
of it.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay, perfect. And then, just circling back on your comments. I think, you 
said something like wealth management NII growth, you expected 4% to 
5% kind of yearly growth. Is that a fair way to think about 2019?

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl 
with KBW. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
Great. Thanks. Yes. Just two quick questions. Fir
st on the deposit and the 
remixing and diversifying of the funding. You saw the long
-
term debt come 
down. Should we think anything at all about turning out on deposits as 
ability to take down debt even further or is just simply switching out debt for 
short
 
term wholesale?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

shifted more to unsecured debt and more towards deposits. We like the 
durability and the cost profile of those two products, gives us a lot of 
stability. You saw our liquidity numbers were up and we are carrying excess 

--
 
give us more 
flexibility around future issuance. But, I think your characterization is 
appropriate.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
And t
hen, quickly on the capital ratios. You mentioned they were strong, 



oing 
--
 
the capital ratios should be 
increasing over the year or irrespective of client activity? You have the 
ability to grow the balance sheet and keep the capital ratios flat for the 
year?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I think, I mean, we have that flexibility. 
We will be accreting capital. 
And if there are opportunities to support clients and invest that capital into

Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. 
Before I comment on our 

on capital returns both for this year and for the medium to long term. The 
recently completed CCAR was a significant inflection point for us. As you 
know, we secured a non
-
objection to increase our capita
l returns. We 
respect the CCAR process and made significant investments in that process 
over the past several years and we have a program specifically focused on 
continuing to raise the bar each cycle.
 
In 2013, we asked for and received a non
-
objection to 
maintain our dividend 
and the ability to purchase the balance of the wealth management business. 
In mid
-
2013, we applied for our first buyback since 2007 of $500 million. In 
this latest CCAR, we applied to double the dividend, our first increase since 
2007
 
and a $1 billion buyback. We intend to (indiscernible) to our capital 
request in future years.
 
Going forward, we will look to drive our dividend yield to at least levels 
commensurate with the broader S&P, which has historically been around 
2%, sustained b
y growing earnings from wealth and investment 
management. In fact, an 80 to 100% payout on just the earnings from 
wealth and investment management suggests an annual dividend at two or 
three times our recent increased level just based on 2013 earnings and 
share count.
 
In addition to growing our dividend substantially, we expect to continue to 
increase our buyback with a focus on both mitigating employee issuance and 
reducing our share count. Share buybacks will make up the difference 
between dividends and t
he total payouts which we intend to drive toward 
100% of churn earnings over the next several years. Now clearly when we 
can do this is obviously a function of regulatory approval.
 
Turning now to the businesses in the first quarter, in challenging markets 
for 
institutional and retail investors, we drove our revenues and PBT higher 
across our three business segments versus a year ago as we continued to 
execute against our strategic plan. Ex
-
DVA, our revenues were up 4% 
versus the first quarter of 2013 while 
our expenses were up 1%. Our 
expense ratios improved across the segments and our overall earnings per 
share grew 13%. In fact, ex
-
DVA our earnings grew despite a significantly 
higher tax rate than a year ago.
 
ROTE from continuing operations excluding DVA i
mproved as well to 9.8% 
while ROE improved to 8.3%, up 130 basis points and 80 basis points year
-
over
-
year respectively. We continue to work towards sustainably higher 
ROEs across all of our businesses through the execution of our strategy with 
a particula
r focus on growth in the bank, which we believe is substantial, as 
well as on a fixed income ROE and our broader firm
-
wide expenses.
 

Ruth to discuss the results in detail.
 
Ru
th Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the 
effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures.
 
The impact of DVA in the quarter was positive $
126 million with $76 million 
in fixed income sales and trading and $50 million in equities sales and 
trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues were $8.8 billion, 
up 7% versus the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing 
operati
ons was 33%. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to 
Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were approximately 
$1.3 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding 
DVA were $0.68 after preferred dividends. On a 
GAAP basis including the 
impact of DVA, firm
-
wide revenues for the quarter were $8.9 billion, 
earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders were $1.4 billion, reported earnings from continuing operations 
per diluted s
hare were $0.72 after preferred dividends. Book value at the 
end of the quarter was $32.38 per share and tangible book value was 
$27.41 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $835 billion at March 31. 
Deposits at quarter
-
end were $1
17 billion, up $4 billion versus 4Q. Our 
liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion compared with 
$202 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
 
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that 
our common equit
y Tier 1 transitional ratio will be approximately 14.1% and 
our Tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 15.6%. Risk
-
weighted assets are expected to be approximately $398 billion at March 31. 
Reflecting our best estimate of the final Fe
deral Reserve rules, our common 
equity Tier 1 ratio using the pro forma Basel III fully phased in advanced 
approach was 11.6% at March 31. Our pro forma standardized ratio was 
10.2%. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the 
recent U
.S. regulatory proposal to be approximately 4.2%. For reference, 
under the prior methodology, our supplementary leverage ratio is 4.5%, up 
from 4.2%. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision.
 
We continue to expect to see the required 5% 
level in 2015, including an 

recently announced more demanding requirements. In addition to the 
mitigation items we highlighted on the fourth quarter call, we see 
opportunities t
o mitigate the recent inclusion of the CDS long add
-
on 
through steps such as compression, re
-
hedging, and roll down.
 
Turning to expenses, our total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion, down 
18% versus the fourth quarter due to significantly lower legal
 
expense, 
seasonality, and our focus on cost reduction. Compensation expense was up 
8% versus the prior quarter on higher revenue. Non
-
compensation expense 
was $2.3 billion primarily reflecting lower legal expenses, seasonality, and 
cost management.
 
Let me
 
now discuss our businesses in detail. In institutional securities, 
revenues excluding DVA were $4.5 billion, up 21% sequentially. Non
-
interest 
expense was $3.3 billion, down 29% versus the fourth quarter. 
Compensation was $1.9 billion for the first quarte
r, up versus the fourth 
quarter on higher revenue, reflecting a 41% ratio excluding DVA. The decline 
in non
-
compensation expense to $1.4 billion primarily reflected significantly 
lower legal expenses. The business reported a pre
-
tax profit of $1.2 billion 
excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, revenues were 
$4.6 billion and pre
-
tax profit was $1.4 billion.
 
In investment banking, revenues of $1.1 billion were down 17% versus last 
quarter, reflecting seasonality. Results represent strong pe
rformance for our 
first quarter across all products. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan 
Stanley ranked number one in global announced M&A and number two in 
global IPOs and global equity and equity linked at the end of the first 
quarter. Notable transacti
ons included: in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as 
advisor on the five largest transactions, including as exclusive financial 
advisor to WhatsApp on its $16 billion sale to Facebook 

 
this transaction 

argest and most 
complex transactions in the technology sector; and as exclusive financial 
advisor to Suntory Holdings in its acquisition of Beam Inc. for $16 billion. 
This continues our leadership in cross
-
border activity as well as in Japan.
 
In equity und
erwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as joint global coordinator for 
the $2 billion IPO of Altice Group. This is the largest ever IPO of a cable 
operator in EMEA. Morgan Stanley also recently acted as lead financial 
advisor to Altice Numericable on its acquisit


-
investment 
grade acquisition financing.
 
In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley also acted as active book runner for 

ring of senior unsecured notes. 

 
Advisory revenues of $336 million declined 25% versus our fourth quarter 
results due primarily to seasonality. Announced advisory transactions wer
e 
up significantly versus a year ago. Equity underwriting revenues of $315 
million were down 24% versus the fourth quarter driven by lower global 
market volumes and typical seasonality. Fixed income underwriting revenues 
were $485 million, essentially flat
 
to the fourth quarter as market activity 
remained at very high levels. Equity sales and trading revenues excluding 
DVA were $1.7 billion, an increase of 13% from last quarter. Revenues were 
strong across regions and products driven by higher client activi
ty. Case 
revenues were up driven by increased volumes in all regions. Prime 
brokerage revenues were up significantly driven by higher balances and 
robust client portfolio management activities. Derivatives revenues grew as 
volatility trended higher.
 
Fixed 
income and commodities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA 
were $1.7 billion, up significantly from the fourth quarter. Revenues 
increased significantly in all major products. Commodities saw broad
-
based 
strength across the energy complex driven by ex
treme weather in North 
America and increased client demand. Revenues outside of commodities 
were driven higher by seasonality and strength in credit products. Average 
trading VAR for the first quarter was $50 million, essentially flat to the fourth 
quarter
.
 
Turning to wealth management, revenues were $3.6 billion in the first 
quarter. Asset management revenues of $2 billion were up versus last 
quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher market levels at the beginning of the 
period and positive flows. Transact
ion revenues decreased 10% from last 
quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $540 million, down 6% 
versus the prior quarter due to fewer trading days; investment banking
-
related fees of $181 million, down 12% versus last quarter, reflecting a 
lower
 
U.S. equity underwriting calendar, most notably with fewer closed
-
in 
funds; and trading revenues of $275 million, down 15% versus the fourth 
quarter, reflecting lower gains in deferred compensation plans.
 
Net interest revenue increased 2% to $539 million 
driven primarily by higher 
revenues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our 
lending products. Other revenue decreased to $62 million from $110 million. 
Net interest expense was $2.9 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. The 
compensation r
atio was 60%, up versus the fourth quarter due to 
seasonality. Non
-
compensation expense was $762 million, down 13% versus 
last quarter due to the absence of an impairment charge as well as 
continued expense discipline.
 
The PBT margin was 19%. Profit before
 
tax was $691 million. Total client 
assets surpassed $1.9 trillion. Global fee
-
based asset flows were $19 billion, 
a record level. Fee
-
based assets under management increased to a record 
$724 billion at quarter
-
end, representing 37% of client assets. Globa
l 
representatives were 16,426, essentially flat to the fourth quarter. Bank 
deposits were $132 billion, down $1.6 billion versus the fourth quarter. 
Approximately $108 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.
 
We continued to grow our wealth management le
nding balances and 
increase our penetration rates with our retail client base. Our mortgage 
balances increased 10% and our PLA balances increased 9%, while our 
committed undrawn PLA facilities grew at an even more rapid pace.
 
Investment management revenues
 
of $740 million were down 12% from the 
fourth quarter. In traditional asset management, revenues of $437 million 
were up 2% from the fourth quarter driven by higher market levels and 
client flows. In real estate investing, revenues of $131 million were do
wn 
18% driven by lower investment gains. Merchant banking revenues were 
$172 million, down 32% driven by a tough comparison to very strong 
investment gains in the fourth quarter. Expenses were $477 million, down 
6% from the fourth quarter due to declines i
n compensation and non
-
compensation expenses.
 
Profit before tax was $263 million, down 22% sequentially. MCI was $54 
million versus $46 million last quarter. Total assets under management 
increased to $382 billion driven by market appreciation and 
increased flows.
 
Turning to our outlook, as we begin the second quarter, our investment 
banking pipeline is strong across all products. M&A is particularly robust. The 
pipeline is growing with an increase in activity from EMEA and Asia. On the 
financing si
de, the flow is healthy for both equity and fixed income 
underwriting. With respect to sales and trading, overall economic and 
market conditions continue to be favorable for equities; however, the 
challenges that weighed on certain parts of fixed income ma
rkets for much 
the quarter persist. On the retail side, trading activity is consistent with 
levels we saw in the first quarter, though we enter the tailwind from higher 
equity markets. In addition, we continue to have momentum with FA 
adoption and client p
enetration is increasing, an important driver of growth, 
profitability, and increased earnings consistency.
 
Over the last several years, we have assiduously worked to reposition our 
businesses in a way that is aligned with regulatory change. We have made 
t
he tough decisions, provided metrics to demonstrate our progress, and 
have a suite of businesses that are complementary.
 
Thank you for listening, and James and I will now take your questions.
 
Question and Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator instructions]
 
You
r first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
ISI
 
Hello. So I have a couple parter on commodities first, just if you could frame 
how much of a contributor it was to FIC in the quarter, whether it be relative 
to last year or 
prior peaks 

 
obviously something went very well there.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, there were a number of important factors in the overall FIC 
performance, strength in commodities clearly being a big driver given 
volatility in the market due to weather and robust cl
ient activity; but as I 
noted, we also had strength in credit corporate and mortgages, and those 
continue to be strong areas for us. So overall, it was up meaningfully. It was 
the biggest driver in year
-
over
-
year performance.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
ISI
 
Okay, and I
 

one of the competitors sold a piece of their physical business. You guys have 

quarter how much of a contributor was that, 
just for the thought process on 
the go
-
forward?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure, yeah. To try and help you size it, you exclude the two physical oil 

-
over
-
year on a percentage basis, so still up exclu
ding those two physical oil 


we have something more to say on that.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
ISI
 

lso mentioned and we could see it in the numbers, 
prime brokerage is doing awesome. Curious on how you weigh that business 

leverage ratio in the group and have some work to do. So I h
eard your 
comments on what you can do in derivs land, but is there any pricing benefit 
that you can pass through on prime brokerage? Just curious how you 
balance that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, I think there are really two different points within your question. Pri
me 

how we manage our business across nine boxes, product on the one hand, 
cash, derivatives and PB and geography on the other hand 

 
Americas, 
Europe and Asia 

 
and we manage real
ly intently within each box. But over 

with our PB clients. The deeper we go with them, the deeper they go across 
our franchise, so we think have a very positive, strong, mutually
 
productive 

 
If I switch to the leverage part of your question, in our view we have a very 
strong, clear path to improve our leverage ratio, and it is consistent with the 
business s



franchise side.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
ISI
 
Okay,
 
cool. I appreciate that. Last one 

 
without opening too many cans of 
worms here, I wanted to get your thoughts on all the focus on high 
frequency and what it means for your equity business. How can you help us 
frame that? That would be super
-
helpful.
 
Ruth
 
Porat
 
Sure. You know, since 2009 Morgan Stanley has been very vocal with 
regulators and has been on the record about the necessity for changes to 

transparency and trading protocol. You can
 

regulators as far back as 2009 

 



implemente
d protocol and governance consistent with this in our business.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
ISI
 
And then maybe just to be annoying, the book mentions a really big number 

want to help us with wha

that.
 
Ruth Porat
 


to all our 

that we do is risk management. Risk management checks add latency, and 
latency is inconsistent with extreme speed strategies. And also to clear up 
any source of confusion, it facilitates 
connectivity only to (indiscernible) 

H&Ps (ph) are not a meaningful driver of our business.
 
Glenn Schorr 

 
ISI
 

 
Operator
 
Your next question come
s from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous 
Research.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Research
 
Thanks, good morning. I noticed that the capital allocated to the institutional 
business came down by about $1.5 billion linked quarter. Is that directly 
relat
ed to RWA reductions that you would have had in the fixed income 
business, or it more complicated than that? And if it is, maybe you can 

 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. It is more complicated than that, but we did have a further reduction
 
in risk
-

as of the first quarter, down from $210 billion in the fourth quarter, so 
continuing to make progress there.
 
The way we calculate required capital is based on whatever the capit
al 
regime is in place at a point in time. In this quarter as a result of the regime 
change, in particular with the Basel I numerator moving to the transitional 
Basel III numerator, that drove the capital reallocation. The Basel III 
transitional numerator b
y definition has deductions that phase in over time, 
so in managing the business we look towards a Basel III fully phased in lens. 
There are a couple of moving pieces 

 
yes, we reduced the risk
-
weighted 
assets, but the biggest driver here at the table is t
he regime change.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Research
 
Got it. And if I can just relate the comment that you made about the 
increase in the old
-
style SLR in the quarter, which I think you alluded to 
about 30 basis points, how does that relate to the target
 
that you laid out 
back in January for a 30 or 40 basis point increase just from exposure, 
compression and the like? Is that being driven by that, or were there other 
puts and takes?
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
comfortable 

 
greater than 5% in 2015, and with increasing returns of capital. This quarter 
in the numerator, we benefited from higher earnings, and as we talked in 
prior calls, that adds what I keep calling a multiplier effect because it 
reduces the dedu
ctions on DTAs, and importantly it also increases the 
investment capacity for those items that get into that 10% bucket, thereby 
reducing the numerator deduction.
 
In addition to that, we have been quite focused on mitigating some of the 
numerator deduction

through, and then in the denominator of course we continue in with 
compression trades in RWA reductions, as I indicated.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Research
 
Got it, and then just to beat a little b
it on the SLR horse, there has been a 
proposal made just in the month of March by Basel

people assign different 


 
well. I was wondering if you had done any numbers on that preliminarily.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yeah, if SACCR is adopted, that would be about a 50 basis point benefit to 
the SLR and a 30 basis point benefit to the standardized ratio.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Rese
arch
 

 
Ruth Porat
 
It is.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Research
 


 
is that a patented Morgan Stanley term?
 
Ruth Porat
 
You can use it if you want.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Research
 
Okay, 
thanks. I guess the only other question that I would really have would 
be if you could

you know, we talked a little bit about commodities and the 
fact that fixed income would still have been up, or FIC would still have been 
up year
-
over
-
year even with the 
planned sales having taken place. Can you 
give us a little bit more color on what you saw in the rates business in the 
quarter, because obviously for banks that have a heavier contribution from 

aw much, 
much weaker results so far.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well look, I think that we

and I said this

and we saw the same headwinds 

market, just given all that was going on in the environment. Fo
r our rates 
business, it was down year
-
over
-
year, reflecting lower volumes, but up 
nicely versus last quarter. We are really focused on this centralized, 
federalized resource management across all of the macro product, but it was 
a tougher part of the mark
et.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Research
 
Got it. So mix was just one of the more important differentiators for you 
guys, I guess?
 
Ruth Porat
 
It was. As I said, it was commodities, it was credit, it was mortgage.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Research
 
Right. 
Just one final question on wealth management 

 
a 10% increase in 
the loan balances linked quarter is obviously strategically what we want to 

sizeable business. How comfortable are you
 
that your risk controls are where 

 
Ruth Porat
 
So the growth



un

precisely for the reason you flagged, which is top of our list, which is ensure 
tight, proper credit risk management and all of the processes around it, as 

 
a good experience for our clients and our financial 

 


mortgage side
 

product are using it longer and increasing their penetration. The credit 
standards are very tight 

 
you know, FICO (indiscernible) 50, LTV 60%; and 

the clients. We have their assets 
here.
 
The other growth area in PLA is a very

is the highly over
-
collateralized, 
significantly over
-

-


virtually no credit losses to date, and risk management has been the driver 
across all of these businesses.
 
Guy Moszkowski 

 
Autonomous Research
 
Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Your next question com
es from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
 
Brennan Hawken 

 
UBS
 
Good morning guys. So just a real quick one to clarify, I believe, Ruth, you 
said that your IB backlog is up. Just wanted to make sure 

 
is that based on 
year
-
end, because Goldman highlighte
d that their IB backlog actually shrunk 
since year
-
end.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So our backlog is up across all products from year
-
end. M&A, as I noted, in 
particular is strong and the pipeline continues to build. I think you can see 
that just from the flurry of announ
cements that have occurred since quarter
-
end.
 
Brennan Hawken 

 
UBS
 
Yeah 

 

another one 

 
the CCAR was sort of a surprise here to some firms this year, 
and I guess the Fed highlighted some 
process improvements in their 
comments. Do you guys have any outstanding process improvements with 
the Fed, and was there anything in that CCAR process that sort of jumped 
out that investors should be aware of?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So I think the whole industry is w
aiting kind of the formal Fed feedback 
process, but I think

you know, we generally received positive feedback 

invested meaningfully in the process and for the last several years, we had 
some
thing we call our CIP program 

 
continuous improvement program. So 
regardless of what we even hear back, we look to up the approach and the 

the bar for ourselves on the overall proc
ess. We feel good about our 
processes around CCAR.
 
Brennan Hawken 

 
UBS
 
Terrific. And is it your view that the Fed feels good about your processes as 


based on the information you received from 
the Fed, is that your 
perception?
 
James Gorman
 



path that
 
we laid out.
 
Brennan Hawken 

 
UBS
 
Appreciate it. Just trying to maybe get some insights into what is proving to 
be a very murky process for all of us on this end.
 
James Gorman
 
Understood.
 
Brennan Hawken 

 
UBS
 
Then is it right that you guys have slimmed do
wn your management 
structure in wealth management? I think we saw a reduction in the number 
of divisions and regions. And maybe, could you help us think about whether 

down decision
-
ma
king and the like. Maybe help us understand that move a 
little bit.
 
James Gorman
 

-
the 
integration. This has been a four
-
year integration, and now that the business 
is very stable, I think the
 
FA account was flat to maybe modestly up. The 

some changes there to just make the organization faster moving, a little 
more nimble, a little more efficient, and put the team in place to 
make that 
happen.
 
Brennan Hawken 

 
UBS
 
Great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions.
 
James Gorman
 
No problem.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
Hi. So to the extent that prime brokerage has 
performed better, can you 
give us any numbers around that 

 
what are the prime brokerage revenues 
this quarter versus a year or two ago, or can you give us some market share 
figures around your prime brokerage business?
 
Ruth Porat
 

t break out components within businesses. The 
client balances and revenues are all up quarter
-
over
-
quarter and year
-
over
-
year.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
Okay, and how does it compare to the time of the crisis? I remember a lot of 
clients were leaving Morgan Stanley
 

gotten back to pre
-
crisis levels? Do you expect to get back there?
 
Ruth Porat
 

continued to nicely steadily build.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
Okay. Shifting ov


deposits?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So last quarter in the deck, we laid out a couple of things because we 
thought it was important as 
everyone was doing their analysis that we show 
you what the asset growth would be and the changing mix over time as we 
moved from cash into FAS and loan deployment and included yields there, 
current yields, and then just to follow the forward yield curve. 
Those really 




environment. But really, the upside to us is the ongoing deployment across 
the portfolio.
 
Mike May
o 

 
CLSA
 

wanted to drive ROE above 10% in fixed income and commodities. Did you 
exceed that in the first quarter, and how is that progressing?
 
Ruth Porat
 

s because you can see the revenues, and I 

down to $199 billion 

 

about 250
-

urns in that 
business, and our view is that we have more do to there.
 


team is continuing to focus on all of those.
 
M
ike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
Can you give us any update on the run
-
off of legacy assets in FIC?
 
Ruth Porat
 

combination of passive and active, and part of the active is how trades are 
structured and par
t of it is actually running down as much as we can as 

billion of risk
-
weighted assets in our fixed income business, and as you 
know, we keep bringing forward our target in time. We d

blocks we provided last quarter. We did see progress across our businesses
, 

early days, and given the opportunity with the bank and moving again from 
over
-

real benefit there, the conti
nued focus on expense management and then 
the ongoing higher return to capital. That 9% number is obviously without 

our share repurchase program, and as James said, our intent is t
o continue 
increasing return to capital over time.
 
Mike Mayo 

 
CLSA
 
So just to be clear, so now your target


now, your target is now 10% return on common equity?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Our target has consistently been 10%. What we tr
ied to break out last 
quarter was what it would be without higher return to capital, and then the 
return to capital takes it above and beyond that. But we continue to be 
focused on 10% return on capital as kind of the next stop along the way.
 
Mike Mayo

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with 
Nomura.
 
Steve Chubak 

 
Nomura
 
Good morning. I wanted to discuss your 10% FIC ROE target for a moment. 

of extraordinary, which has driven required capital levels down pretty 
meaningf

derivatives under the modified SLR approach, even when we contemplate 

CDS maturity matching, SACCR model approval, et ceter
a, it appears that 
required capital for FIC under the modified SLR calculation could still be 
pretty materially above that under the risk
-
based framework. So essentially, 

highlighted in the 
past is still achievable whether one evaluates under a 
leveraged or a risk
-
based lens.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, and we look at our businesses under a risk
-
based and leverage
-
based 

-
based capital rule; but again, we 

their balance sheet under that SL

spotlight on the opportunities for mitigation in the areas where mitigation is 
absolutely key. So as you pointed out in your question, there are additional 
work streams that can added to that, which we discussed last
 
quarter, with 
the inclusion now of net long CDS, so that opens up an added work stream. 
So we do see a good path forward to greater than 5% under the SLR, 
including higher return to capital; and yes, we hold ourselves accountable 
for that greater of risk
-
based capital and leverage
-
based capital.
 
Steve Chubak 

 
Nomura
 

about was the Fed had clearly stated its plan to consider applying additional 
capital surcharges on wholesale borrowi
ngs. The details that have been 
disclosed thus far regarding the methodology or the potential approach 
remain somewhat murky, but I wanted to see if you had any additional 
thoughts or insights regarding how that rule
-
making could potentially shake 
out.
 
Rut
h Porat
 


 
the rule is

the discussion at this point is unclear. I think 
the terms that have been used, such as short term wholesale funding is one 
phrase. We talk a lot about the difference between short
-
term wholesale 
funding and durable fu


built in durability that has been evident in all sorts of periods of market 
stress, market stress in Europe. We think that liquidity
 
durability is 




 

but we ha

ding.
 



looking for.
 
Steve Chub
ak 

 
Nomura
 
Okay, and I guess one more question on the SLR proposal. Parsing out the 

identifying systemically important banks, one being GAAP assets in excess of 
$700 billion and AUC 
in excess of $10 trillion. Based on your interpretation 
of the Fed proposal, do you believe that the GSIV (ph) classification can 
potentially be avoided for those banks which operate below those designated 
thresholds, and specifically would you consider op
timizing your balance 
sheet size if it enabled you to potentially bypass the tougher 5% leverage 
rule, or is that simply not a viable strategic option given growth initiatives at 
the bank and other potential opportunities that will drive future balance 
she
et growth?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, given our suite of businesses and the strength of these businesses, we 


both the
 
gross up in the denominator and reduce some of the deductions in 
the numerator, which are accretive to the SLR. If you look at some of the

the relationship across our various businesses, so for example as I talked 
about on prior calls, within our investme
nt banking franchise, quarter after 



d it does 
require that we have a corporate credit capability 

 
you know, origination 
and distribution. So there are a lot of linkages between the businesses, 
increasingly so with the wealth management business, and our view is that 
when we look to the sing
le most important thing, which is how do we drive 
ROE for this firm given there is a path to increase the SLR that enables us to 


he best way to drive 

lower than $700 billion of assets.
 
Steve Chubak 

 
Nomura
 
Okay, understood. And just one final one on the numerator upside you had 
discussed regarding the SLR. 
We really appreciate the helpful detail in terms 
of the individual components that you disaggregated driving the 80 basis 
point build in the SLR over

towards that 5% goal. I was hoping you could at 
least clarify the level of incremental preferred issuance 

help close that gap, just to get some clarify on those which will impact future 
earnings versus those which will have

essentially be earnings neutral.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. So the

as you saw, we did about $2 billion of preferred last year 

 
th
at was in two transactions. We will continue to optimize our capital stack 

continue to leg into more over time. I think when you

you know, the two 
that we did last year, you can s
ee that we tried to size them

modestly size 
them or appropriately size them, whatever word you want to use for it, and 

numerator.
 

 
the pace with which 

that investment basket has within it a couple of opportunities to continue to 
mitigate some of the numerator drag.

Deutsche Bank
 
Good morning. Can you update us on the expense efforts? Obviou
sly good 
revenue this quarter, so expenses were higher; but it sounded like in the 

base. I was hoping for an update either on FIC expenses or just overall 
expenses.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So w

the end of 2012, going into 2013; and just as a reminder, at the time we 
had an 84% expense ratio, and with the $1.6 billion reduction, assuming 

o adjust for the noise around activity
-
based revenues, we said we would get to a 79% expense ratio, excluding 
elevated legal expenses and, if there any write
-
offs, any write
-
offs, and that 
would be by the end of 2014.
 

atio excluding DVA, so I think what 
that underscores is expense

you know, very much part of the DNA of all of 
our business leaders. We have the balance of the year to continue focusing 

rious 



with still more time
 
to get to the end of the year, when we said we would hit 
that number.
 


 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay, and if the revenue environment improves, a little bit tougher from 
here in, say, the markets businesses, do you feel like you can still 
maintain 
the expense ratio around here, or still look back towards a 79% goal?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So what we indicated was that we would be at a 79

back at the end of 
2012 when we laid out the $1.6 billion, we said a 79% expense ratio 
assuming revenues were flat t
o 2012. Again, depending on where the world 


 


 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. Outside of the core e


but any thoughts on how we should be modeling out litigation expense from 
here?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, you sort of answered the question 

 



 


 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. And then just switching to the wealth mana
gement, the 19% PBT was 
in line with what we had for this quarter. Just any updates on how you feel 
about the 22 to 25% target by the end of next year?
 
Ruth Porat
 

are looking to de



do with lending product and the benefit from 
the growth in lending, and you 



w
ith lending product, they continue to further penetrate their client base and 
we see much more of a take
-
up. So that is an important element of it, along 
with, back to your prior question, the continued focus on expense 
management.
 


 
Deutsche

Okay. All right, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of 
American Merrill Lynch.
 
Michael Carrier 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a follow up on t
he wealth 
management business. You mentioned some seasonality in the first quarter 
versus the fourth quarter, I think fewer days. Maybe just a little color on the 
comp 

 
Matt just asked about the margin, about how that impacts it, and 
just the outlook as w
e kind of go throughout the year, just assuming less 
seasonality.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as you said, seasonality comes from a couple of things. One is several 

the comp line because FICA
 
is a first quarter event, so when we compare our 

the difference in quarterly seasonality and a nice pick
-
up from the 17% last 
year to the 19% this year.
 
What we also saw in the fi
rst quarter this year was some lower issuance 

within the wealth management system is U.S. new issue product, and in 
particular closed in funds, and that was just a bit lower. We h
ad a nice 
underwriting calendar but it was more skewed outside of the U.S. and very 

quarter, we have a couple tailwinds going into the second quarter. Asset 
management fees will 
be modestly higher given the starting S&P level, and 

environment and the new issue calendar; but the pipeline is stronger in the 

er in the U.S. And then in 
aggregate, expenses should be a bit lower given the comp point I made 

 
FICA being a first quarter event, and non
-
comps do tend to be a little bit 
higher in the second quarter but overall should result in an improved margin 
here.
 
Michael Carrier 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow
-
up, just on the trading side, whether 

color


e side in terms of the OTC 
markets transitioning on to SEF, like any color there. Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as it relates

nothing really lumpy to note. I mean, we had

there was a 
good volume of activity, prime brokerage activity with portfolio 
rebalancing, 
just given volatility in equity markets; and then in terms of the impact of 
SEF on the market, we really think the lower volumes last quarter were 
related to broader market events, and in particular lower volumes in macro, 

ented on, given all that was going on globally, and 
markets lack conviction 

 
they traded in a tight range. Spread product did 

the extent to which, if at all, that was really SEF
-
re
lated. We think that it 
was swamped by what was going on in macro.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham 
Research.
 
Jim Mitchell 

 
Buckingham Research
 
Good morning. Just a quick follow
-
up on the expense question. I 
just want 
to check 

 
if you think about your closest competitor on an apples
-
to
-
apples 

strongest quarter, a target of 79%. Do you think this is an interim target 
and you can get more as 
you move forward as revenues get better, and/or 
you still have some more expense leverage elsewhere? Can you just kind of 
walk through that?
 
Ruth Porat
 

different business mixes. You 

comp ratio, as an example, and the comp ratio in wealth management is off 
of a formulaic grid so it starts higher than their institutional securities 
business. And is it trending lower? Yes, it absolutely is tre

talked about that quite a bit. It will continue to benefit from the growth in 

-
to
-
oranges comparisons if 
you just start with that line.
 
As it relates to our non
-

ing to see benefit 
across the franchise, the ability to use technology more broadly across the 
franchise as an example, and so we are focused on the items that we 

add to it beca


or in any other approach to the business. But just going back to my comp 

lso business mix.
 
And to be clear, those business mixes also have different capital 
requirements, and there are a whole host of different elements that go along 

 
Jim Mitchell 

 
Buckingh
am Research
 
Fair enough. I was just talking about the institutional business, but I hear 
your point. Maybe just quickly another question on the dividend. I think 
James had mentioned looking at a payout that would approximately or get 
close to the net incom
e of the wealth management business, but as that 
business grows, it seems like if you were to approach that level of dividend 

that is doable?
 
James Gorman
 



coming from a relatively stable annuitized set of businesses in wealth and 
asset management, one thinks about your dividend payout
 
a little bit 
differently as it relates to your ability to afford it coming from things that 
you know are fairly predictable.
 
Obviously when you aggregate it all, you come up against what appropriate 


simply indicating we believe we have capacity, given our business mix.
 
Jim Mitchell 

 
Buckingham Research
 
Okay 

 


 
on the physical oil sale, you 
mentioned or sort of gave a guide on the revenue im
pact. What would be 

 
Ruth Porat
 
In terms of the businesses that we are looking to sell, as I indicated last 
quarter, one of the things that was quite intriguing was precisely that, is the 
more modest PBT a

weighted assets pretty 
meaningfully.

Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
 
Devin Ryan 

 
JMP Securities
 
Hey, good morning. How are you? I just have a couple follow ups on 
investment banking. So I guess first with respect to M&A
, announced activity 
in North America has actually recovered since August levels 2007, but you 
guys have been noting on the last couple calls here that EMEA more recently 
has been feeling better. I just wanted to get some thoughts 

 
does it feel 

 
still on a distressed asset sale cycle in Europe, or are you starting 
to see more traditional strategic M&A accelerating there, which I think would 
be necessary to see a real recovery in activity in that region.
 
Ruth Porat
 

 
across industries of activity, and what we 


cross
-

 

is whenever a negative trend reverses itself. And comparable to GDP growth 

starting to see the knock
-
on benefit to some of the activity levels.
 
James Gorman
 
An

over there is Germany, and having made a couple of trips recently, I think 
the corporate CEOs are still quite conservative in their views, so there will be 
a tipping point here. Obvio



not there yet. There have been isolated transactions a
cross the U.K., Spain 
and other places.
 
Devin Ryan 

 
JMP Securities
 
Great. Appreciate that color. And then fixed income underwriting results 

attractive rate environment but are you 
starting to see a mix shift there at 
all in terms of what products are really driving this strength? Has there been 
any change in mix?
 
Ruth Porat
 


fit of the higher levels of M&A. In the first 
quarter, I think what was notable was there were a lot of deals across 

were some really big, chunky items that drove the quarter. It was 
a balance 

this is event
-
related, and we think given the pipeline in M&A, that bodes well 
for continuation of strong debt underwriting, notwithstanding the fact that 

ng string here of strong quarters with debt underwriting.
 
Devin Ryan 

 
JMP Securities
 
Okay. I guess just with respect to how that ties in with FIC results, there 

get a better un
derstanding around the strong results within credit and 
maybe how much of that was a function of issuance really starting to pick up 
towards the tail end of the quarter. Any color around maybe how credit 
specifically progressed throughout the first quarter
.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Credit on the fixed income side was pretty consistent throughout the 
quarter. I think if you go back a couple of quarters ago when there was 
more volatility in credit markets, what you saw was notwithstanding a strong 
new issue calendar, it wa

follow
-

-
through to secondary trading now, and hopefully that continues, in particular 
given the volume of what we would expect would continue t
o be new issue 
product on the fixed income side, assuming the M&A pipeline continues to 
hold up and we see the execution continuing as it has these first couple of 
weeks in the quarter.

James Gorman
 
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2018 
began on a 
very strong footing. In the first quarter, firm revenues and net 
income were a record, $11.1 billion and $2.7 billion respectively. The ROE of 
14.9% comfortable exceeded our targets, albeit in what is typically a 
seasonally strong quarter. Importantly, the
 

demonstrated our inherent operating leverage in an attractive market 
environment. Results across all businesses were consistently strong.
 
Our sales and trading businesses performed exceptionally well against the 
backdrop of heightene
d volatility and client activity. Equity Sales & Trading 
benefited from strong volumes across all regions. Return volatility in rates 
and FX markets provided clients with an opportunity and a catalyst to 
rebalance their portfolios. This activity combined w
ith the rise in U.S. 
interest rates and changes in inflation expectations contributed to strong 
fixed income results. We remain appropriately sized to take advantage of 
active markets when they present themselves. Investment banking 
demonstrated sustained 
strength despite new issue markets being 
punctuated by periods of elevated volatility.
 
Wealth management remains solid. For the quarter, the combination of 
continued advisory growth supported by secular trends and the businesses 
scale driven operating leve
rage produced record pretax profit of $1.2 billion. 
This represents an almost 20% year
-
on
-
year increase in PBT with the 
margin and the range we set to achieve out of the 2 years. At the same 
time, we continue to actively invest in the business building out
 
our digital 
offerings, banking products and technology capabilities more broadly.
 
Investment management again witnessed net long
-
term inflows over the 
quarter as the team continues to produce strong investment returns across 
both alternatives and public m
arkets. We expect attractive returns from 
investment management in the years ahead particularly as we take 
advantage of our global platform. In the quarter, we closed the Mesa West 
acquisition and made several key highs. We have often said that wealth and 
investment management give us balance and our other businesses make up 
the engine that drives this going forward in more active markets. That is 
exactly what we witnessed in the first quarter. For the past several years, a 
lot of focus has been put on the 
importance of the stability that wealth 
management has brought to our firm. This focus has been appropriate. 
Margins of 26.5% on revenues of $4.4 billion would have been unthinkable 
just 3 years ago.
 
However, what is not being discussed as often is our con
tinued commitment 
to strengthen the institutional securities businesses. In institutional 
securities alone, the dominance of equities, the strength of fixed income and 
the breadth of investment banking generated over $6 billion in revenue. 
Along with the r
est of the industry, we recently submitted our 2018 CCAR 


models, but over the years we have seen a reasonable
 
degree of variability. 
Therefore we are prepared for a range of outcomes this year.
 
More importantly, beyond this year the Fed Reserve has recently requested 
comments on several proposed rulemakings. We expect that we and the 
U.S. financial sector more br
oadly will benefit from more sensible and less 
complex regulation. We believe we have sufficiently capitalized and expect to 
maintain our attractive capital return profiles over the coming years. As we 
look forward our objectives remain the same to execute
 
on our strategy and 
deliver on the medium
-
term goals laid out at the beginning of this year. I am 
confident that given our business model makes and the competitive strength 
of our global franchise we are very well
-
positioned.
 
I will now turn it over to Jo
n to discuss the quarter in detail.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

businesses and regions. Global markets were active, our institutional 
securities businesses benefited from increased trading volu
mes and a return 
of healthy volatility across many asset classes, while wealth and investment 
management businesses delivered solid results weathering softer asset 
prices. Revenues were up 17% sequentially to $11.1 billion, a firm record 
after excluding th
e impact of DVA in prior periods. PBT was $3.4 billion, EPS 
was $1.45, ROE was 14.9% and return on tangible common equity was 
17.2%. Total non
-
interest expense was $7.7 billion, up 10% year
-
over
-
year. 
The increase was driven by a combination of higher comp
ensation expenses 
and execution related costs associated with higher revenues and business 
volumes respectively. Continued investment into technology also contributed 
to the increase. Over that same period revenue growth was 14%. In the 
quarter the firm ef
ficiency ratio was 69% with all segments contributing to 
strong operating leverage. The gross
-
up impact of the new accounting 
guidance for revenue recognition was not material at the firm level. The 
details are more fully described in the quarterly supplem
ent.
 
Now, I will turn to businesses. Institutional securities generated revenues of 
$6.1 billion. This represents a 35% sequential increase and the best 
performance for the segment as a whole since 2007. Investment banking, 
equities and fixed income all co
ntributed to the results. Non
-
compensation 
expenses were $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 6% increase driven by higher 
execution expenses. Compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, representing 
compensation to net revenue ratio of 35.4%. In investment bankin
g, we 
have generated revenues of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase over a strong fourth 
quarter. The results reflect the combination of increased advisory revenues 
and stability in underwriting, all regions demonstrated strength. Advisory 
revenues for the quarte
r were $574 million, up 10% sequentially. 
Announced M&A volumes have had a strong start to the year. Notably there 
has been a pickup in both larger and cross
-
border transactions. Clients 
remained engaged and pipelines are healthy.
 
Turning to underwriting, 
new issue market conditions were more challenged 
during periods in the quarter, despite doubts of heightened equity volatility, 
rising interest rates and wider credit spreads, results remain solid. Equity 
underwriting revenues of $421 million were up 1% se
quentially. The market 
backdrop impacted our ability to convert some of our IPO backlog, but 
follow
-
on activity remained robust. Regionally, we witnessed strength in Asia 
and the Americas. We also saw issuers take advantage of higher volatility 
through inc
reased convertible issuance. Fixed income underwriting revenues 
increased 4% sequentially to $518 million. A decrease in high yield financing 
was offset by increased investment grade issuance. This was supported in 
part by event driven activity including o
ne large financing we provided 
together with our partner MUFG. Overall, investment banking pipelines 
remain healthy and diversified across products, regions and sectors. 
However, as demonstrated by recent market dynamics future activity may 
be impacted by 
regulatory, macro economic and geopolitical factors.
 
Our sales and trading businesses produced revenues of $4.4 billion, up 64% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter, increased market activity, strong client engagement 
and more favorable bid offer spreads particularly duri
ng the first half of the 
quarter drove the improvement in results. In equities, we retained our 
leadership position and expect to be number one globally. Revenues were 
$2.6 billion, up 33% sequentially on strength across all products and all 
regions. Deriv
atives had a very strong quarter as episodes of volatility 
created significant trading activity and strong client demand for hedging 
solutions. A combination of higher client balances and increased engagement 
generated a sequential rise in prime brokerage 
revenues. And cash revenues 
also saw quarter
-
over
-
quarter increase benefiting from strong volumes 
globally particularly in Europe and Asia.
 
Fixed income was also strong. Revenues in the first quarter were $1.9 billion 
more than doubling fourth quarter resu
lts. While seasonal patterns were a 
contributing factor, the sharp rise in interest rates in the early part of the 
quarter heightened volatility levels and the rise in inflation expectations 
aided activity and our performance. Our macro business performanc
e was 
solid driven by improved sequential performance across rates in FX. The 
credit businesses performed well.
 
Our securitized product group had one of its best quarters in close to 4 years 
driven by strength in Europe and a more active trading backdrop. 
Deepening 
our institutional lending footprint has aided this revenue stream. Commodity 
revenues were also strong. The results benefited from both an increase in 
flow activity and more structured transactions, which can be episodic. Fixed 
income results dem
onstrate the operational flex in the business and the 

Average trading VAR for the period was $46 million, up from $38 million in 
the fourth quarter 2017. The increase was driven by hig
her market volatility 
and facilitation of increased client activity.
 
Turning to wealth management, revenues of $4.4 billion were down 1% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset 
by the impact of mark
-
to
-
market un
-
deferred com
pensation planned 
investments. Despite lower sequential revenues, the segment produced 
record pre
-
tax profit of $1.2 billion resulting in a PBT margin of 26.5%. The 
40 basis points of sequential margin increase and 250 basis point uplift 
compared to last y

this scale business. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, non
-
compensation expenses 
are flat despite an 8% growth in revenues.
 
Total client assets, was essentially unchanged at $2.4 trillion reflecting 
softn
ess in domestic and international equity indices. Fee
-
based assets 
continue to be a source of long
-
term organic growth for the business 
supported by both conversions from brokerage and net new asset flows into 
the firm. Net fee
-
based asset flows of $18 bil
lion were strong. As a result, 
fee
-
based assets reached a new high of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client 
assets. Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion. Positive flows in last 

r 
calendar days in the quarter.
 
Net interest income was $1.1 billion. Higher average balances and yields 
were offset by an increase in funding costs driven primarily by higher rates 
on our deposits. Lower suite deposit balances also impacted NII as retail 
clients have continued to deploy cash into the market. Cash in our clients 
accounts remains at historical lows and equity allocations remain at historic 
highs hovering around 54% of client assets. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, net 
interest income is up 8%. Th
is has been driven primarily by an increase in 
wealth management lending in the U.S. banks. Loan balances were up $6.7 
billion or 11% with growth across both SBL and mortgage.
 
In the quarter, loans grew by 1% to $68.3 billion. The more modest space of 
sequ
ential loan growth was driven by rising rates, deepening pay
-
downs and 
a lower level of mortgage production as we transitioned to our in
-
house 
origination platform. Retail engagement was strong in the quarter as 
investors actively repositioned portfolios a
nd responded to market volatility. 
However, total transaction revenues of $747 million, was down 5% driven 
principally by the impact of mark
-
to
-
market on deferred compensation 

gy
rations in equity markets and our pace of investment, pre
-
tax profit 
reached new highs. We continue to pursue enhancements to our digital 
capabilities and we are continuously introducing new applications to the 
organization. Over time, we believe that thes
e advancements will enable our 
advisors to provide better advice in service and broaden their client 
relationships.
 
In investment management, revenues were $718 million, up 13% 
sequentially driven by higher asset management fees and the assets of last 
quar

quarter
-
over
-
quarter with long
-
term AUM of $312 billion, up 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Although we saw outflows in our liquidity business as clients 
manage their cash balance needs around the tur
n of the year, our long
-
term 
strategy saw continued positive flows. In the quarter, we also closed the 
Mesa West acquisition, adding private real estate credit capabilities for our 
platform. Asset management fees of $626 million were up 9% sequentially 
on 
the back of higher average AUM for the quarter. We continue to see 
stability in fee rates earned on our long
-
term assets. Invested revenues 
were $77 million, down by 31% relative to last quarter, impacted by lower 
market performance in certain private equi
ty related funds. Total expenses 
increased by 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, largely driven by the revenue 
recognition gross
-
up related to this segment.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, total spot assets of $860 
billion was essentially flat. 
As a result of higher lending commitments 
supporting relationship and event activity in the quarter, our standardized 
RWAs grew by approximately $12 billion to $389 billion. Basel III 
standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio is expected to decrease to 15.6%
. 
Our supplementary leverage ratio is expected to remain relatively 
unchanged at 6.3%. During the fourth quarter we repurchased 
approximately $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 22 million 
shares and our Board declared a $0.25 dividend per share
. This morning, we 
announced the share repurchase plan with MUFG. As part of our regular 
repurchase program, we will make pro rata purchases directly from MUFG. 
This will help ensure compliance with their passivity commitments of the 
Federal Reserve by mai
ntaining their ownership below 24.9%. This will not 
impact our strategic alliance.
 
Our tax rate in the first quarter was 20.9% reflecting the reduced U.S. 
corporate tax rate and benefits associated with share
-
based payments. Our 
guidance for the full year 
remains at 22% to 25%. Since the vast majority of 
share based award conversions are placed in the first quarter, we expected 
the tax rate for the remaining quarters to be at the upper end of this range. 
This quarter demonstrates the strength of our franchi
se and the benefit of 
our global business model. As we look forward, we remain confident that we 
are well
-
positioned to execute the medium
-
term strategic objectives that we 
laid out earlier this year. In the year 

 
in the near
-
term we are aware of the 
frag
ility of market sentiment. We have emphasized the importance of open 
and functioning markets as it relates to our performance. This quarter 
results demonstrate that increased levels of activity and client engagement 
are broadly beneficial to our business.
 
With that we will now open the line for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven 
Chubak of Nomura. Your line is now open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Thanks. Good morning all.
 
James 
Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Steven Chubak
 
So I was hoping to just unpack James some of your comments surrounding 
the recent proposed changes to capital regime, as we think about the capital 
constraints that you are looking to manage to longer term, historically y
ou 
have been a bit more leverage constrained, we now have this enhanced SLR 
and SEB proposals that are out there and there are some expectation that 
risk based ratios could once again become a bit more binding. And just 
based on the new proposals as outlin
ed in your initial read, which constraints 
are you now more focused on in terms of what informs not just future 
payout capacity, but also how you are thinking about your balance sheet 
strategy longer term?
 
James Gorman
 
There is 

 
well, there is a bunch in 
that, obviously. I think the first point just 

economic scenarios which are driven by the 10% unemployment 
requirement under Dodd
-
Frank and when your unemployment is currently 
run 4%
, 4.1% in this country, you need some very severe shocks to hit 


 

outcome which then generates models which are very severe. So, this year 
will be kind of interesting to see how it al
l plays out. We obviously believe 
we are well capitalized, but we kind of anticipate how all these 

 
the tests 
this year will play out. So, what we are really focused on is 2019 ongoing 
and you are right the SEB buffer comes into play. Historically, you ar
e right, 


 
I think are constrained 

exactly, but I am pretty sure. And it will remain the constrained under the 
traditional CCAR mod
el. Under the SEB proposal, I think you are right that 
the likelihood is that the CET1 ratio would be the constraint rather than the 

where it comes out and we are on a common period 
at the moment, but the 
Fed Reserve has asked for its sponsors to the multiple road changes and Jon 
may have something to add to these comments by the way, but the Fed has 
asked for a comment on that and where that comes out remains to be seen, 
but I have a
lways found it slightly surreal that the binding constraint would 
be the balance sheet, debt balance sheet irrespective of the content of 
assets that comprised that balance sheet. Having a capital as the leverage 
ratio of cash or treasuries or other forms 
of government securities versus 
highly illiquid high
-
risk securities seems to me the kind of thing one would 
want to differentiate against.
 
So, I have always in my mind leverage ratio should have played a 

 
should 
have been a secondary ratio to the core ca

personal view, because it leads to a very bizarre outcome, but in order to if 
your constrained as leverage ratio, it might cause you to be very aggressive 
on the risk
-

verage ratio 

anywhere in the world would want. So, I am kind of welcoming the shift to 
the SEB model, I think if it translates to Morgan Stanley, which I think it all, 
the constraint
 



today. Whether and how much better off, but I
 

 
Steven Chubak
 
Alright. Thanks, James. As a very comprehensive response, I will switch over 

encouraging to see continued robust fee
-
based flows, improvement in
 
pre
-
tax profitability probably the one area that maybe fell a bit short of our 
expectation was NII driven in part by slower loan growth. I know you had 
spoken if some of the factors, including the migration of mortgage 
originations in
-
house, but how shoul
d we think about the outlook for loan 
growth in the coming year and maybe against the backdrop of rising funding 
cost, how does it inform your outlook for the NIM trajectory from here?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. So, I would say that the NII results and lending 
results were actually 
in line with our own expectations. I think what we have talked about coming 
into the 

 
throughout last year as well as coming into this year was a couple 
of factors that we suggested would slowdown NII growth in this segment 

s what we obviously saw this year or this quarter excuse me. We 
still do believe that we will have good loan growth and that will be a driver of 
the NII growth going forward. Last year, we grew loans by about $7 billion 
or $8 billion. Our portfolio is now 
about $70 billion. So, we will grow 
probably at a slower pace for the reasons you highlighted the transition and 

portfolio. We still feel like there is opportunity within our c
lient set if you 
look at penetration numbers and whatnot that will continue to grow that 
line, but at a slower pace. We also told you last year that we saw that the 
deposit deployment strategy that we had in place was going to play out and 
we were planning
 
on diversifying our deposit and liability structure, which we 
obviously have done. What we have seen and we talked about this last 
quarter and again this quarter or excuse me last year, our clients are 
deploying more cash into the markets and then putting
 
it into different types 
of investments. The good news is that we still capture those assets when 
they go into advisory accounts and other transaction
-
related accounts, but it 
has brought down our sweep accounts and we have replaced those with 
higher cost 
deposits and you are seeing that on the net interest expense line 
item. The other point I would make just quickly or briefly is that we had 
seen very receptive network if you will to our new products, particularly 
around some of the CDs and savings promoti
ons that we have been running. 
So, we have been able to raise $10 billion odd deposits since last summer 
albeit at a higher price. So, I think this is actually playing out as we 
expected and it is going to be growth, but it will be slower.

Thank y
ou. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of 
UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning, just wanted to ask another question here on the lending and 
such, Jon, you highlighted that the institutional lending supported 

 
or len
t 
some support to big trading results here this quarter. We certainly saw 
strong growth in the institutional balances here. Is some of this funding that 
you are doing for CDs being used to fund some of the institutional loan 

 
long that would stay on the balance sheet 
and does this provide a pipeline for some DCM activity here in the coming 
quarters?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So a lot of questions in there and I would basically say yes to all of them. 

-
off. So 
if you look in our disclosures I think on one 
of the pages in the supplementary deck has the U.S. banks. You will see that 
as you mentioned that the institutional lending has increased, a lot of that 
has been in our Fed secured business or our warehousing 
businesses which 
have been very active. There is good velocity in those facilities. We have 
seen really good strength actually in Europe as we help finance some of our 
clients to buy some of these portfolios that the banks have been selling. So 
that has be
en a good business for us, good velocity, good yield and that is 

that we talked about in wealth management, because it shows up in the ISG 
lines. So there is good asset sensitivit
y and good growth in that line item, 

items, so good growth in that area. We continue to see or have the ability to 

rce of 
revenues for us, stable revenues.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Terrific. So, the follow
-
up would be then I would expect that at least what 
was certainly volatility supported some of the trading strength here this 
quarter, there is also some annuitized component t
o some of the revenue 
strength here in trading that sits on the balance sheet and another 
component which you might not have touched upon, so I want to try and get 
out it different way, is the CD or is the CD is being used to fund this and are 
those deposi
t costs being born in the NII line in wealth, but not necessarily 

going to 

 
my focus on the wealth NII, but you really are generating 
economics this is not pulling through th
at line? Thanks.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So yes, I mean again within fixed income there are lots of businesses macro 
and micro corporate trading commodities are within our FPG business, a 
larger percentage of that that line item over time will be coming from these
 
lending activities. And we have seen good growth in that area. Again, the 
bank 

 
the primary funding sources for the bank are deposits and they are 

as some of the other external 
sources that we have to fund the institutional 
part of the lending program. So again, you are right that it is a growing part 

us some stability and we like the credit charact
eristics and the yield 
characteristics of that business and we will continue to try to grow it going 
forward.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore. 
Your line is now open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thanks very much. Just 
a question historically the whole industry, but 
Morgan Stanley specifically had big seasonality in the first quarter, I thought 
a chunk of that had to do with the physical commodities business which is no 
longer there, but putting aside that this was a mor
e active first quarter in 
general, you talked about securitized products, you also talked about some 

but should we be expecting seasonality of the past given that the higher 
activi
ty levels and those specific components this quarter?
 
James Gorman
 



second part and then Glenn I will get back to 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
On the NII comment, obviously we transfer price across segments. So, some 
of the benefit of those deposits is being born in the NII of the banks clearly 
and how it falls within the seg
ment is ultimately a function of usage in 
activity level. And now to Glenn, in terms of seasonality, we did exit many of 
our physical commodities businesses that I would say added to the 
seasonality because we were generally owners of commodities in oil du
ring 
the winter with the weather you saw different seasonality components to 

speaking though, if you look back over 5, 10 years of first quarter has 
generally been seasonally strong
, particularly in ISG sales and trading and 

repositioning for the year or the start of the measurement period in terms of 
their performance, but there generally has been real seasonali
ty in sales and 
trading. We clearly saw that in the first quarter this year. If you look at the 
wallets at least based on some of the early data, it suggests that the equity 
wallet is up, fixed income wallet is also up, but I think also if you look 
certain
ly quarter
-
over
-
quarter, year
-
over
-
year, equity wallet would be up 
and it looks like fixed income is actually quite balanced.
 
James Gorman
 
I just make an observation that yes, historically the first quarter has been 
the seasonally stronger quarter across W
all Street, but you have got to also 
take into account what the business mix is. 10 years ago or 12 years ago 
when I started here, I was running wealth management, I think our 
revenues in wealth management be in the quarter
-
to
-
quarter and our pre
-
tax at th
at point was around 3% or something in that order. Obviously, we 
are in a very different planet now. So, that $4.4 billion plus or minus a 
quarter and pre
-
tax over $1 billion, you add wealth, the way I think about 
this, I had wealth and asset management to
gether and say we start off 
every quarter at $5 billion in the bank. And then if you think about equities 

we have had an equities quarter below $1.5 billion and quite a long time
 
since we have had a banking quarter much below $1 billion, I mean, they 
have been I think some in the high 900s. So, I think at $2.5 billion pretty 
much in the bank from those. So, every quarter kind of begins with roughly 
$7.5 billion. The flex is obviou
sly how strong the markets are reflecting in 
the new issue calendar which pumps up the banking reflecting in equity 
activity, depending 

 
the season, what time of the year it is and then 
obviously fixed income. And as you correctly point out, the tail that
 
wagged 
the dog for a while in fixed income was the big physical commodities in 
some of the very large multiple structured trades we did. A lot of that has 




 

unlikely to have the kinds of downs that we had before we got rid of the 
physical stuff and restructured the business. So, I think the range of this 
firm is kind of a worst case scenario without the market comple
tely 
imploding around $7.5 billion a quarter. That was not the case 10 years ago 

sort of balanced and then the speed obviously in a good market, the 
seasonally strong market, an
 
active market, which we had in the first 
quarter slightly lower tax rate, slightly lower preferred that we have every 
other quarter, then you are going to be at the highest end of 

 
or towards 
the higher end of your ranges.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
I appreciate that 
much more than I thought. Appreciate it.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski of 
Autonomous. Your line is now open.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning. James, I think I got the gist of what you were trying to say 
at the outs

a range, but I think you were trying to send some messages there and I was 
just hoping that you could elaborate a little bit on what you mean by that 
versus how you might view future CCARs?
 
J
ames Gorman
 
Well, very simply, Guy and I appreciate that follow
-
up question there. Very 
simply put, we have increased the dividend I think 4 years in a row and 
increased the buyback 4 years in a go. We have gone from $0.05 and $0.5 
billion to $1 and $5 bil
lion. And this test is, I mean, this is a hard test. If you 
have to generate a 10% unemployment number and the unemployment is 
currently 4.1%, you have to provide some pretty extraordinary shocks to hit 


 
I am not
 
saying people actually 


Dodd Frank legislation and the outcome that has to be generated. We 
obv
iously 

 
the firm has not materially grown in anyway that would suggest 

more earnings. The firm is operating of the tax rate nearly 10 points below 
what it was a year ago. The 
firm has more earnings coming out of wealth 
management which are more stable. So on any objective assessment, you 
would say that there is 

 
we are approaching 100% payout last year, I think 
we are in the high
-
90s if memory serves me. You would expect us to
 
be 
paying out certainly anything that we accrete and some that would be any 
objective assessment would say that. I am just saying against the backdrop 
of the way the particular models of this test is splitting out for 2018. And I 

the case for 2019. So I want to really separate those 

we will ask for what we think we should be getting and what I think our 

the Federal Reserve 
until the results are outlined. But I have seen over the years I have seen 


exactl

deliberately which you picked up, I am prepared for the range of outcomes 
for 2018.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 

pick up on tha
t was something that Jonathan mentioned in his remarks was 
the concept of the bid offer which was up very strongly in the early part of 
the quarter, I guess across a wide range of products and I would just be 
interested in a little bit more color on what y
ou saw, where you saw it and in 
terms of products and areas and to what extent should we think that this 
has probably normalized already?
 
James Gorman
 
Just before he does say, I just want to be clear. We are highly confident in 




our capital. We have capital sufficient last year by de
finition every dollar you 
accrete from then on you would either give back to shareholders and put to 
good use. So we are highly confident about that position. What I am 
anticipating is I have been around this track [ph] long enough and made 
sure enough of 
these tests and seen enough variability that when you dial 
the scenario up to the level it got out up it can lead to unintended 
consequences. Jonathan?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I would add you heard, Guy that we repurchased $1 billion in the quarter. 
This quarter w
e have a $5 billion authorization that James referenced and 

bid offer spread, it really anytime you see heightened volatility in the equity 
markets around some of our market m
aking activities, you would generally 


just simple as that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next que
stion comes from line of Mike Mayo of Wells 
Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi, this question might do on the category of no good deed goes 
unpunished, but you have the biggest gap between your return on equity 
and your targeted return o
n equity, so the fact that you are not raising 


compete away the tax benefits or you just want to be super
-
safe especially 
after your first couple of years and CEO, James, you got started, but you 
missed a couple of targets and now you are exceeding them and you are 
exceeding them by wide margin, so why not increased target?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, Mike, glad you as
ked the question, not to correct you, but I will 

 
actually we had a bigger gap between our return targets and our 
performance and that was when we generated 2% ROEs and we had a 10% 
target which if memory serves me you reminded us pretty frequently on 
the

an all science, there is 

 
there are these things called the markets that 
operate here and we build our business models to function well in bad 

egy could be defined simply, it would be 
that we will do fine when the markets are tough and we would do well when 
the markets are good. There are others who might do better when the 

mar



-
term range, so I think about 
those for a couple of years. So, 
it would be kind of silly to bounce around 
after one quarter, but putting that aside, just philosophically, the target 
range is supposed to represent a normal set of outcomes under kind of 
tough market environment and a good market environment. This was a 
very 
good market environment as we sit right at the outset, not perfect, we can 
definitely do better. The underwriting calendar was not phenomenal. Wealth 
management transaction activity is extremely light. We had very few gains 
in the investment portfolio
 
where we are managing expenses strongly, but 
not ruthlessly. So, there is things we could do clearly to drive returns higher 
up putting aside revenue growth. But what we are focused on is how we are 
going to do in a difficult microenvironment. So, seasona
lly just add in the 
extra preferred agreement tax rate up to the sort of 23%, 25% range that 
Jon talked about and the return to this quarter probably dropped from 
14.9% to rough math about 14%. So, think of it as starting basis is 14%, 
yes, the high end of
 
our target was 13%, but as I said, a very good 
environment. If we go to the end of this year and we were consistently 
above 13%, then I will come back to and I am prepared to renegotiate our 
goals at that point.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Fair enough. And one follow
-
up in
 
terms of environment now that you have 
$70 billion of loans, up almost 20% year
-
over
-
year, how do you reassure 
investors that these loans will stay of good quality?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, I think from the overall credit quality, there is a couple of 

majority of the wealth management loans, virtually all are secured in one 
way, shape or form whether that be via house or our bigger portfolios 
around the security
-
based lending wher
e we have good LTVs and good data 
protections. On the mortgages, I think you know our portfolio has been very, 
very clean and then on the institutional side, again all of that lending is 
secured. The warehouse business has good structural protections and g
ood 
haircuts. Our commercial real estate portfolio also has performed nicely in 
terms of its LTVs and whatnot, but again, we are in a pretty good credit 
environment. I would suspect at some point we will get into a credit cycle 
and you will see more losses
 


strong credit characteristics.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. 
Your line is
 
now open.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Thank you. Good morning. Jon, can you share with us your thoughts on you 
talked about the mortgage production and moving it in
-
house may have 

clients tend t
o be obviously higher net worth type of clients. Have you seen 
any evidence ye that the salt issue when it comes to the state and local 

mortgages yet?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
To be honest, the an
swer is no. And I know there was a lot of discussion 
about people moving and particularly at places like California, New York, but 


 
our provider was PHH, they have changed their b
usiness models, so we 
had to bring change ours. So, we brought it in
-
house and we have purposely 
slowed down that production to make sure that we have the right 
infrastructure and level of client service required for our clients. We still 
think there is op
portunity to grow. As rates rise, we will also see presumably 
less runoff, but again we feel good about where we are in terms of the 
lending growth slower first quarter, but as expected.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Very good and then just pivoting to the trading area i
n equities, obviously 
you have made a meaningful commitment to technology in low touch trading 
versus the traditional high touch trading, can you share with us how those 

coming more 
of a low touch trading environment and which you guys of 
course are one of the leaders in?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I think there has been a multiyear trend of more electronic trading 
versus voice trading. And we have seen that quarter
-
over
-
quarter. We 
benefit
ed obviously this quarter as we have seen that transition. The 
volumes are going up dramatically and although there is different pricing 
dynamics around price versus actually the voice versus electronic. We have 
been making up a lot of it in volume, but th
ere is clearly pressure on the 
voice trading part of the business.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank 
of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Thanks 
guys. Jon, you guys generated good operating leverage in the 
quarter, comp ratio lower, just on the non
-
comp side, we expected 

driven by activity versus what you guys mentioned on t
he investments in 
wealth management like what we should be expecting is more ongoing?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, I think based on sort of our expectations in budgets, we actually were 
right in line with sort of what our expectations were on sort of the non
-
rev
enue related items and then we feel a clearly increase in BC&E which 
shows up in the BC&E line, an increase in transaction taxes, increases in UK 
bank levy and some of the other things that would show up in the other 
expense line. So where we expected the 
increase is we had a little bit of 
increase in occupancy as we knew we were renegotiating some leases. We 
have got some expenses related to some of the planning we are doing in 
Brexit. So again all of the expected slight increases that we felt we would 
hav
e, we saw and then the real increase in expenses was virtually all related 
to the sales and trading and revenue related activities.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay, got it. And then just as a follow
-
up on the capital ratios in the stress 
capital buffer, I just wanted
 
to give or take given that it will be more 
variable or volatile going forward, do you expect some more transparency in 
the calculation of the test and if you get that then can you better manage 
like the current kind of portfolio in the business to maybe n
avigate that 

 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

announcements and Vice Chairman, Carla has testified yesterday or day 
before and made some 
comments. I think there is clearly a trend towards 
simplification. There is a trend towards more transparency. There is a trend 
towards more bespoke regulation based on your own individual firm risk 
profile. And there is an element of recalibration 10 year
s after the fact. And I 
think transparency for us that might lead to better stability would really be 
transparency around the actual scenarios. We have seen this test get harder 
year
-
after
-
year as James mentioned at 10% unemployment rate, but also 
every ye
ar when we get there scenarios and upfront market shock in the 
past, there is always a couple of things in there that surprised us and to be 
fair are not necessarily are 100% consistent with how we see the world and 
what would happen in a scenario like tha
t. So anything around transparency, 

on. And I think Vice Chairman, Carla has mentioned something about 
putting out the scenarios for comment. I mean any of that would be helpful 
for
 
us to plan our business, because we look at things for the longer term 
and to get a surprise year
-
after
-
year based on sort of the scenario does 
obviously inhibit that 

 
some of that long
-
term strategy planning.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes 
from the line of Jim Mitchell of 
Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Good morning, just a follow
-
up on that, you guys, James as you said you 
have built more stable you think stable kind of revenue producing business 
model you had when 
we look at the stress test, you get hit the hardest in 
terms of starting point to stress minimum in terms of loss rates that seems, 

hit hardest in this SEB even though you have ple
nty of capital. How do you 

 
is there anything we can view think about or going forward that you can sort 
of help the Fed or help yourself kind of reduce the higher losses that they 
attribute to your firm, how do we think about offsets going forward or how
 
do you think about it?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
This is 

 
I will try to take a chance. Again, the transparency in their models 
and one of the uncertainty this year is they are continuing this sort of 2
-
year 
phase
-
in transition on some of their PPNR models. As James mentioned, we 
think we have created a 
much more stable revenue base yet in the stress 
cases that they have prepared, our PPNR has been a wildly unpredictable 
and wildly low. Some of that this year is going to be a function as you know 
are of significant portion of our revenues in wealth comes 
from our fee
-

that obviously has an impact on our business. The other thing you should 
know is all these tests were not allowed to do make any sort of management 
actions. So, we just 
watch all of this go on and have no ability to react to it. 
So, we do have a high reduction. Also, some of that has to do with just our 


efit from the tests, which is also 
one of the reasons why I think 

 
and I think Vice Chairman, Carla has 
mentioned this yesterday, we do think that a recalibration of the GCIP 
methodology, particularly MiFID II would be helpful. Our de
-
risking strategy 
has
 

have got a pretty big gap between the MiFID I and MiFID II and so those are 
some of the types of things that we would like to comment on going forward 
in this process.
 
James Gorman
 
A
nd just specifically on us historically as we said, the constraint was 
leverage ratio. And if 

 
as the models in the Fed have done, you grow your 

4.5% a year. So, I have said this 


 

time of financial distress and deflation of financial assets unless you are 
requiring other institutions, that just is illogical and I
 
have seen no empirical 
evidence to support balance sheet growth during that time period. And I 
think that view has started to resonate. And I think Vice Chair, Carla has 
talked about some of that in one of his speeches recently as they are 
considering mov
ing to the stress buffer model. But I think in fact our 
experience was I think our balance sheet strength of memory, certainly 29% 
post
-
crisis. So, under that we would be wildly overcapitalized from a 
leverage ratio perspective. Now, I am not suggesting th

to model it in that regard, because obviously we took very draconian steps 
because we had to and a stronger institution might take less return 
draconian steps and we believe we are a stronger institution now. But the 
bottom line is w
e have always had the constraint to leverage ratio if you 

be having this discussion.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Right, absolutely. Thanks for that. And then maybe a follow
-
up on just as 
awful cha

traders, has the uncertainty and complexity of that rule kind of hurt them in 
anyway, do they feel like some greater simplicity would help a lot or just a 
little, I mean, is it more of an ex
pense issue? Just trying to think through if 
there is any kind of material impact where the revenue and expense is from 
some simplicity in the Volcker rule?
 
James Gorman
 

Volcker
 

clearly what Paul Volcker was trying to do was restrict deposit
-
taking 
institutions from putting their own capital at risk in proprietary trading or 
investing and it walked into somethin
g, which is far more complex requires a 

and move from focused on proprietary activity to principal trading activity. I 
think the regulators are obviously very aware of the industr
y response on 
this and this is an opportunity where they are taking a hard look at it. I do 
not expect the Volcker rule to be removed. I am not sure it should be 
removed, because I am not sure banks should point large parts of their 
capital at risk in prop
rietary trading or proprietary investment position. So 
the essence of what Volcker was trying to do I would personally agree with, 
the way in which it was executed left some revision would be appropriate.

Thank you. Our next question comes from th

Christian Bolu
 
Good morning James. Good morning Jonathan. Thanks for squeezing me in 
here. On the wealth management side, just want to follow
-
up on the NII 
questions, I guess just to wrap it all
 
up, how should we think about 
sequential quarter progress going forward, should we be thinking about 
growth for Q1 base and also if you have the deposit, the brokering deposit 
number for the quarter that would be helpful also?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure and aga
in the way I would describe this first of all I think you have 

to move quarter
-
over
-

lot, it sort of grinds it out. If you l
ook over the year
-
over
-
year comparison, 
NII is up 8% driven by very nice loan growth. And I would say going 
forward, we have 

 
I have tried to highlight in this call that the loan growth 
to be at a slower rate than last year. We are also up of a bigger bas
e and we 
are also not going to get the benefit of sort of the lower betas or the betas 

 
actual betas sort of below sort of the predicted model beta is 50%, I think 
we are going to start seeing the betas and we already have creep up 
towards that 50% type o
f level. So again, we do expect NII growth, it will be 
slower than we have had over the last 5 years. I mean we have tripled our 

started with a lot of new products and a lot of new s
trategies. But we will 
continue to see growth just at a slower pace.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. Just sorry the growth is sequential or year
-
over
-
year growth, I guess 

 
James Gorman
 
I am sorry, when we talk about NII growth, we are talk
ing year
-
over

year, 
so if you look at historically we have been growing NII year

over

year on 
average $500 million, we are clearly telling you that we are going to grow

Thank you. Our n
ext question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein of

Kian Abouhossein
 

the best performances you have seen over the last 4 years and I was just 
wo

data and you particularly highlighted Europe in that context as well which 
historically is a very small part at least if you look at that logic data in terms 
of revenues, issuance reven
ues, I am just wondering what is driving that for 
you, it looks like you are gaining market share, so I want to understand 
what you are doing in globally, but also in Europe in particular in this area?
 
James Gorman
 
Again, I would say broadly fixed income w


-
performance in a lot of places across the globe, number one. In terms of 
FPG and one of the things that we highlighted, Europe is again in th
is 

 
in 
our warehouse business we have been very active supporting clients as 
some of the larger banks have been getting out of real estate portfolios as 
they continue to de
-
leverage and we been providing financing for European 

good business for us. We obviously some 
combination of both syndicating out that exposure, but also securitization 
activity on the back of it has been very good for us. So again, I called out 
FPG just because if you look at percentages it did sort of outsh
ine if you will 
the other areas with both fixed 

 
excuse me, FX and commodities, but it 


 
it was just a little bit better in a lot of different places all overall the 
world across products and that geographies.

Thank you. And the last quest
ion comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of 
KBW. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Kleinhanzl
 
Yes. Thanks. Just had a quick question on the wealth management space, 
we saw that the reps were down 1% year
-
on
-
year, I mean going forward is 
that just the right w
ay to think about your advisors in that business, there is 
going to be a declining based from here or will there be a some point we can 
actually see growth in advisors?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I mean I think generally the attrition has been pretty low 1% is a 
relatively 
small number given the size of the franchise with the ages and retirements 
and some people still leaving. What we have seen to
-
date this year is 
actually a significant slowdown in the number of people who have had left. 
Generally, the size of th
e production of the people who have been leaving 
has been quite low. We have deemphasized recruiting. We have only 
recruited a handful of people over the first quarter, but I think generally 
speaking flattish and plus or minus 1%, I sort of bucket into the
 
flattest 
categories sort of how we see this certainly in the near term as we continue 
to invest in our current franchise, our current FAs and our current 
infrastructure.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. I would focus on total assets and assets per adviser more than the 

the last question I know there are other people on the line, I am sorry about

7/20/12,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning, this is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During 

supplement, and strategic deck, copies of which are available at 

presentation may include forward

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 

through our 
outlook and plan for 2017, but before doing so, let me briefly touch on the 
fourth quarter.
 

first quarter, Morgan Stanley delivered three consecutive quarters with
 
revenues at approximately $9 billion, each with an ROE north of 8%. While 
our fourth quarter contained some positive and negative adjustments, which 
Jon will touch on shortly, our operating performance was consistent with 

e beginning of the second quarter.
 
There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there 
was at the beginning of 2016. The surge in consumer confidence after the 
U.S. election, the recent and anticipated Fed rate hikes, the strengthen
ing 
U.S. economy and potential corporate tax reform are positives for our 
business. Notwithstanding these potential positives, we intend to remain 
extremely disciplined. This is especially true with regard to expense 
management.
 
Before transitioning to our
 
annual deck, let me say a few words about 

and management committees have spent much of their careers at Morgan 
Stanley, with many having dedicated more than 20 years to this firm. The 
stability of the team combined with the depth of experience and operating 
discipline honed in the difficult years during and after the financial crisis is 
an undeniable asset in the years ahead. In the next minutes, you will hear 
us delve into numbers and 
goals, but it is the culture and people of this firm 
that will get us to where we want to be.
 
Now with that, please turn to the slides that you can find on the investors 
relations website, after which Jon will take you through the quarter in detail. 
Follow
ing our prepared remarks, we will both take your questions.
 
Slide 3 outlines the key strategic objectives for 2017 that we reviewed on 

to deliver $1 billion of expense reductio
ns to our cost base in 2017. On 

-
compensation 
expenses significantly and continued to exercise discipline on compensation.
 
At the end of 2015, we undertook a meaningful restructuring of our fixed 
income
 
business in an effort to better align its capital and resources with the 
market opportunity. Our goal is to maintain our historical revenue footprint 
of $1 billion
-
plus per quarter but with significantly fewer resources. In 2016, 
we exceeded this average 
quarterly target with full
-
year revenues at $5.1 
billion and delivered three consecutive quarters above that $1 billion mark.
 

-
tax margin was 22%, and we 
expect to hit the 23 to 25% range by year
-

hieved record 
pre
-
tax earnings of $3.4 billion in the face of a number of macro headwinds, 
including sustained low interest rates and muted retail investor engagement.
 
In 2016, we received a conditional non
-
objection to our CCAR capital plan, 
which include
d increasing our buybacks by 40% to $3.5 billion and our 
quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.20 per share. We re
-
submitted our revised capital plan in December and look forward to hearing 
back from the Federal Reserve on our results.
 
Finally, 201

2017.
 
Turning to Slide 4, you can see that our ROE obviously was 8%. Assuming 
normal market conditions prevail, as they did over the last three quarters 
when our ROE averaged 8.5%, we remain on t
arget for our 9% to 11% goal 
for 2017.
 
As outlined on Slide 5, there are a number of opportunities for us to continue 

five opportunities in turn.
 
On Slide 6, turning to that now, you c
an see that although our total 
revenues were relatively flat in 2016, we grew our pre
-
tax profit excluding 
DVA by nearly $1 billion. As a management team, we have focused on 
controlling what we can. Optimizing our expense base has been a key tenet 
of this 
approach and is a measure of our operating leverage.
 

to date. Notable successes include leveraging our centers of excellence, 
reducing headcount in call locations, and closing red
undant data centers. 
Additionally, the broad
-
based nature of the initiatives has energized a more 
expense
-
focused culture across the whole firm. This should help us realize 
the remaining savings potential in 2017 and maintain operating leverage in a 
rising
 
revenue environment.
 
On the compensation side, our ISC expense compensation ratio met our 
target to be at or below 37%. Savings were driven by the fixed income 
restructuring and our continued discipline. In wealth management, we 
demonstrated progress towa
rds our goal of achieving a compensation ratio 
of 56% or lower. We intend to maintain that discipline consistent with the 
goals mentioned while recognizing the competitive dynamics in this 
business. The combination of these efforts resulted in a meaningful
 
improvement in our expense efficiency ratio from 77.2% in 2015, excluding 
DBA, to below 75% in 2016.
 

M&A and retained our ranking in a market that exhibited resilience in 2016. 
The
 
year was more challenging for the equity underwriting market as 
volatility and the idiosyncratic risk events kept many would
-
be issuers on 
the sidelines. On a diminished industry fee base, we maintained our market 
share. Looking to 2017, we are optimistic
 
and see upside from a 
normalization of volumes.
 
Slide 8 outlines key strategic priorities within our sales and trading business. 
In the fall of 2015, we unified our sales and trading franchise under one 
leadership team, and 2016 was a year of integration.
 

the divisions holistically, aiming to optimize resources, talent, capital and 
technology. Our equities division has consistently been number one among 
global peers. We continue to refine our strategy with the goal of maintaining 
that le
adership across regions, including as a top franchise among global 
firms in Europe and profitably growing wallet share. This includes deepening 
our relationships in prime brokerage as well as focusing on providing 
content, capital, and execution services t
o clients in flow trading.
 
In addition, we remain committed to investing our Asia franchise as we 
expect a positive long
-
term secular trend of increasing activity and 
improving liquidity in the region. While the equity sales and trading 
landscape remains c
ompetitive, the shifting dynamics may benefit the 
leading players.
 
The restructure in fixed income made a year ago was consistent with our 
objective to have a credible and critically sized business that was relevant to 
our clients and supported adjacencies
 
that exist with our ISG and wealth 
management franchises. Turning to Slide 9, as you can see on one measure 
of success, we set an internal target which was externally communicated to 
generate average revenue on a quarterly basis of at least $1 billion wit
h 
reduced resources. As properly discussed, we met this goal and we want to 
ensure it plays out through 2017 and beyond. The results are encouraging. 
Importantly, in a more favorable environment characterized by rising rates, 
more active macro markets, and
 
a vibrant corporate activity, we expect to 
participate in a growing wallet but with a lower cost base.
 
So to finish our discussion on sales and trading, I would like to point to the 
very strong performance in equities. For the third consecutive year, we 
i
ncreased wallet share to 20%, maintaining revenues in excess of $8 billion 
in a shrinking market.
 

-
year transformation 
of the wealth management business. The Smith Barney acquisition gave us 
an undenia
ble scale benefit, particularly when combined with ongoing cost 
management. At the same time, we built our bank infrastructure and have 
seen material growth in annuitized revenues. As you can see, this led to a 
22% compound growth rate in our pre
-
tax earni
ngs since 2010 against a 4% 
growth in revenues.
 
However, as shown on Slide 11, what has been missing from this picture is 
retail investor engagement and any material benefit from rising rates. The 

17 and 2018 
combined with a more positive investor sentiment lead us to believe there is 
real upside to the business over the next several years. Realizing that upside 
will require us to maintain expense discipline as we grow revenues.
 
In addition, two yea
rs from now the 10
-
year retention notes that were put in 
place with our Smith Barney acquisition will expire. Further, our U.S. bank 
subsidiaries continue to provide us with organic revenue opportunities, not 
only because of the expected rate rise but also
 
because of the continuation 
of our deposit deployment strategy. We intend to discuss this in more detail 
in the year ahead.
 
Before moving ahead, let me spend a few moments on Slide 12 to discuss 
the digital landscape. Much has been said about the digital 
shift in financial 
services, and there is no question that technology is changing some areas in 
the wealth management arena. It is an important strategic component for us 

threefol
d: first, we want to modernize our branch system using digital to 
allow our financial advisors and branch operations to be more efficient 
serving current clients. Second, we want to provide our financial advisors 
with the necessary tools and analytics to d
eliver high
-
quality advice and 
engage with clients through a variety of channels. Finally and over time, we 
want digital capabilities to service individuals who are more focused on a full 
digital relationship. As part of achieving these goals, in 2016 alon
e we 
negotiated over 10 alliances with industry
-

hear a lot more about this throughout the year.
 
Slide 13 then summarizes the growth opportunities in wealth management. 
Together with an improving U.S. economy, moderating re
venue headwinds, 
execution of both our revenue and expense initiatives as well as structural 
savings from the Smith Barney transaction, all of these serve as a powerful 
combination to achieve our margin targets in 2017 and beyond.
 

spend a few moments addressing investment management. 
Slide 14 outlines the business. As a reminder, the business has 
approximately $400 billion in assets under management with world
-
class 
expertise in a number of segments, including our real assets, portf
olio 
solutions, liquidity, and global equity businesses. In the fall of 2015, we 
asked Dan Simkowitz to run the business reporting directly to me. 
Throughout 2016, we undertook an organizational realignment aimed to 
unify the business, rationalize costs, a


growth by launching new products such as our ultra
-
short bond fund, and 
have had strong momentum in fundraising across a number of funds, 
inc
luding private infrastructure and real estate. Finally in 2016, we dealt with 
what I would describe as legacy clean
-
ups to the business.
 
In the fourth quarter, we sold or marked down a number of third party LP 
fund positions from the 2005 to 2007 period. J
on will walk through the 
associated costs in a moment. I am confident that the business will move 
forward on more stable footing. In the medium to long term, we continue to 

year.
 
Let


total payout to approximately $5 billion while also growing our common 
equity base. We believe we are mor
e than sufficiently capitalized for our 
business mix as well as for our size and risk profile. Strong capital return is a 
critical element of our future success.
 
Thank you for listening. Now let me turn it back to Jon, who will discuss our 
fourth quarter r
esults, and then together we will take your questions.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you James, and good morning. The fourth quarter was solid, 
demonstrating continued consistency and progress against the 2017 plan we 
outlined last year. In a quarter that is typic
ally characterized by a slowdown 
across several of our businesses during the holiday season, we generate the 
highest quarterly revenues for the year. Firm revenues of $9 billion were up 
modestly compared to Q3, making the third consecutive quarter with 
rev
enues of approximately $9 billion. In the fourth quarter, CBC was $2.2 
billion, EPS was $0.81, and ROE was 8.7.
 
Our results in the quarter benefits from net discrete tax benefits of $135 
million. These tax benefits were largely offset by other discrete ite
ms in 
wealth management and investment management, which I will discuss 
shortly.
 
For the fourth quarter, non
-
interest expenses were $6.8 billion. Typically 
fourth quarter seasonality and professional services contributed to the 
sequential elevation. For th
e full year, non
-
compensation expenses are down 
approximately $700 million. Total non
-
interest expenses were down a little 
less than $900 million for the year. While some of the expense reduction 
was attributable to our business mix, Project Streamline ini
tiatives 
accounted for the vast majority of these savings.
 

$1 billion of expenses by 2017, assuming flat revenues. The targeted 
reduction was driven by three core levers: support s
ervices efficiencies, 
compensation discipline, and normalized litigation.
 
As it relates to support services, we continue to make progress in our 
workforce strategy, taking advantage of technology as appropriate. We have 
thoroughly reviewed our vendor relat
ionships, identifying and executing 
consolidation opportunities that resulted in synergies and rate reductions. 
We have noticeably reduced marketing and business development costs by 
actively managing discretionary spending combined with price 
renegotiatio
ns. We continue to benefit from shutting down the two North 
American data centers and remain on track to close two additional ones last 
year. Finally, where we have right
-
sized certain businesses, we have also 
right
-
sized related support groups. Further, w
e have discontinued services 
and associated non
-
compensation costs tied to these reductions.
 
In addition to support service efficiencies, we remain disciplined around 
compensation, and litigation expenses have also decreased year over year. 
As we look forw
ard to 2017, we are well on our way to executing the roughly 
200 expense initiatives we identified. Importantly, we are focused on 
keeping these costs permanently out of the expense base.
 
Now to the businesses. Our institutional securities franchise perfor
med well 
in Q4. All three of our major business lines produced strong results with total 
net revenues of $4.6 billion, essentially flat to the third quarter. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 11% 
sequentially mainly driven by 
seasonality and execution
-
related costs. 
Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing our full
-
year ISG 
compensation to net revenue ratio to 36% compared to approximately 37% 
last year, excluding DBA.
 
In investment banking, we generated $1.3 billion i
n revenue, a 15% 
increase over the third quarter. The increase was driven by continued 
strength in advisory and a rebound in fixed income underwriting revenues, 
partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. For 2016, we are 
number two globally in
 
IPOs, announced M&A, completed M&A, as well as 
equity and equity
-
linked offerings. Going into 2017, the overall investment 
banking pipelines remain healthy. Capital markets are open and functioning 
with increased investor optimism post
-
election. It is too
 
early to tell whether 
the optimism will translate into conviction, allowing us to pull deals from our 
pipeline into the markets.
 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $628 million, up 25% versus 3Q16, 
and at $2.2 billion they were up 13% for the full yea
r. In an environment 
where growth continues to be challenged, clients are engaged in strategic 
dialogue and executing on meaningful transactions.
 
Turning to underwriting, the difficult environment for equity underwriting 
observed throughout the year contin
ued into the fourth quarter. Revenues 
were $225 million, down 5% versus 3Q16. Several political events, such as 
the U.S. election and the Italian referendum, along with actions by the 
FMOC, ECB, and OPEC contributed to conservatism by issuers and investors
 
throughout the quarter. Specifically in IPOs, while activity generally picked 
up after the first quarter, volumes in 2016 were down 35%.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 16% sequentially to $421 
million, driven by strength in high yield and a 
pick
-
up in event lending. As 
previously discussed, we tend to perform better in markets where we see 
more non
-
commoditized debt products and activity. Looking ahead, both 
investment grade and high
-
yield markets continue to be open to issuers, and 
we expect
 
to see healthy activity in 2017.
 
Sales and trading revenues were flat sequentially, weathering seasonal 
trends, demonstrating strong and consistent performance throughout the 
quarter. In equities, we expect to finish number one globally for the third 
cons
ecutive year with annual revenues again exceeding $8 billion. In the 
fourth quarter, revenues were just under $2 billion, up 4% versus the fourth 
quarter. Performance was strong across all products and regions.
 
Revenues in the Americas has particularly str
ong growth as investor 
optimism and trading activity improved after the election. As a consequence, 
cash equities were higher sequentially as market volumes increased. 
Compared to most fourth quarter, derivatives withstood recent seasonal 
trends and demons
trated strength throughout the year.
 
In fixed income sales and trading, we continued to build on momentum from 
the prior two quarters. Q4 revenues of just under $1.5 billion were 
seasonally strong and essentially unchanged from the third quarter. 
Idiosyncr
atic events resulted in an active trading environment. Quarter over 
quarter, our macro businesses benefited from increased volumes in rates 
and repositioning in FX as the markets re
-
priced the path for U.S. monetary 
and fiscal policy following the election
. Credit saw a sequential decrease as 
activity was slower than the third quarter, although the general environment 
remained relatively benign.
 
Fixed income RWAs and SLR exposure ex
-
lending were $117 billion and 
$339 billion respectively on December 31. As 
James discussed, we are 
managing our sales and trading business holistically and are sharing and 
optimizing resources as appropriate. Accordingly, going forward we will no 
longer report individual RWA and SLR targets for fixed income.
 
Full revenues for fix
ed income of $5.1 billion, up 19% versus 2015, are the 
highest since 2012 ex
-
DBA. The comparison is more favorable when taking 
into account the sale of our oil merchanting business in 4Q15.
 
Lastly, average trading VAR for the quarter was $39 million, down 
versus 
$42 million last quarter. We continue to take advantage of periods of market 
liquidity to de
-
risk our balance sheet. This provides us with an opportunity to 
prudently raise VAR if accretive client opportunities present themselves.
 
Now turning to wea
lth management, we reported record net revenues of $4 
billion, and annualized revenue per FA is over $1 million for the first time. 
The PBT margin was 22%, negatively impacted by a provision in connection 
with certain brokerage tax reporting issues. We saw
 
strong client flows of 
$17 billion. Fee
-
based assets increased 3% to $877 billion and now 
represent 42% of client assets. Both are at respective highs. Total client 
assets now stand at $2.1 trillion and this positions us well going into 2017.
 
Asset manage
ment revenues increased 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, further 
building our base of annuitized revenues. Net interest income was up 11% 
sequentially. The increase was attributable to both loan growth and lower 
prepayment amortization. Bank lending balances were 
up approximately $3 
billion quarter over quarter, ending the year at $60 billion. Over the last 
year, net interest income growth of 19% was primarily driven by our deposit 
deployment strategy and lending growth. Looking ahead, we would expect 
further NII g
rowth but expect a more balanced contribution from deposit 
deployment and interest rates.
 
Transactional activity benefited from the strength in the back half of the 
quarter as retail investors re
-
entered the market, driving stronger 
commission revenues. Th
is was partially offset by a continued subdued 
equity underwriting calendar. Total transaction revenues were $774 million, 
down 2% versus 3Q but up when excluding the impact of mark
-
to
-
market 
losses on our deferred compensation plans.
 
Non
-
compensation expe
nses were up 13% in the quarter. The 
aforementioned provision and seasonality contributed to the increase. The 
compensation ratio was 56.5 on a full
-
year basis, on track to meet our 2017 
objective of at or below 56%. The execution of our expense initiative
s has 
allowed us to continue to invest in our infrastructure, our digital capabilities 
and readiness for future regulatory developments, while simultaneously 
improving our margins.
 
In investment management, total net revenues were $500 million, down 9% 
qua
rter over quarter. The business reported asset management fees of $512 
million and AUM of $417 billion, both essentially unchanged versus 3Q. 
Investment revenues in the quarter were negative $24 million, which 
included a loss of approximately $60 million a
ssociated with the sales and 
markdowns of non
-
strategic third party LP investments. Overall, expenses 
were up 4% quarter over quarter.
 
Following updated guidance from the Federal Reserve at the end of 2016, we 
will apply for additional extensions for essen
tially all of our investments in 
legacy cover funds, subject to the Volcker rule.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, total and average assets remain relatively flat 
at $811 billion and $821 billion respectively. Pro forma fully phased in Basel 
III 
advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $371 billion, 
essentially flat to the third quarter. Our capital position remains strong. Our 
pro forma fully phased in Basel III advance common equity Tier 1 ratio 
stayed flat at 15.8%. Our pro forma fully ph
ased in supplementary leverage 
ratio for the quarter increased to 6.3%.
 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of common stock or 
approximately 27 million shares, and our Board declared a $0.20 dividend 
per share. For the full year, we repurc
hased $3.5 billion of common stock or 
approximately 117 million shares, compared with $2.1 billion or 
approximately 59 million shares in 2015.
 
Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.2%, including the $135 million 
discrete tax benefit. For the full year 
excluding net discrete items, our tax 
rate was approximately 32%. As wealth management continues to become a 
larger percentage of our PBT, we would expect our tax rate to drift higher 
towards 33% in 2017 and we would expect our tax rate to continue to 
exhi
bit quarter to quarter volatility. Of course, all of this is subject to U.S. 
corporate tax reform.
 
As James discussed, we started 2016 with five strategic objectives to be 
achieved over two years, and we have made solid progress on all of them. 
We are on t
rack to achieve our 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. Although the 
revenue environment was challenging in the first quarter of the year, we 
were able to position ourselves well for 2017 and beyond. We did this by 
improving our cost discipline and executing str
ategic initiatives, including our 
bank strategy and our fixed income restructuring, while retaining leadership 
positions in areas of traditional strength of equities and investment banking.
 
Recently, increased investor optimism and more constructive market
s are 
positive signs for our businesses. As always, changes in macro and 
geopolitical factors can have meaningful impact to market sentiment, but for 
now we are encouraged by the increased confidence of market participants.
 
With that, we will open the line
 
to questions.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator instructions]
 
Our first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. 
Your line is now open.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Thanks, good morning. As you pointed out, you met a lot of your obje
ctives 
for the year, and I guess it points to the question specifically in fixed 

dollars quarterly, and even in what was a terrible year last year, you 
managed 4.3, I think, and t
his year you did 5.1. It kind of begs the question 

 
James Gorman
 
You know, Guy, these were targets we put in place a year ago for 2017. 

questioning our strategy over the last several years. I think we feel pretty 
good about what we did in restructuring the business. I think the new team 
bringing together with equities obviously was a very positive move there, 


ahead of ourselves at this point. Most of our peer companies do not put out 


 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Okay
, fair enough. By the same token, looking at Slide 13 where you show 


bit higher, though. Maybe you can give us th
e thought process there and 
what you might aspire to by the end of the year.
 
James Gorman
 
You have remarkable good eyesight, Guy. I had not noticed that graphic 

further, our pre
-
ta
x margin in the mid
-

The scale economics of the business are sort of unshakeable, and building 

has been the retail investor, what has been missing 
has been the new issue 
calendar in the last several months, and what has been missing has been 
interest rates. If those things happen, just from the position we are in now, 
we feel obviously strongly about the target for this year. If those things 
happen, 

-
 

what the question marks were meant to evidence, not exactly the line on the 

felt for a long, long time.
 
Guy Mo
szkowski
 
Fair enough, and thanks for that. Maybe I can just follow up on one of the 
items that you mentioned there in terms of interest rate sensitivity. Your 
interest rate sensitivity disclosure feels somewhat mechanistic 
-
 

the bank. I was wo
ndering if you had maybe a more holistic view for wealth 
management in particular as to what, say, a parallel shift in the yield curve 
of 25 or 50 basis points should do, all other things equal for the wealth 
management business.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Let me try
 
and take that one, Guy. I think as you point out, the wealth 
business and the NII in that business is clearly the most sensitive to rates. I 
think last year, we told you that the growth in NII 
-
 

what slide it is 
-
 
but we showed you th
at in wealth, it went from $3 billion to 
$3.5 billion. That was really driven by deposit deployment and the growth in 


obably going 
to be more mixed in terms of where that comes from.
 
We still have some room to play out in the deposit deployment strategy. We 
still feel good about our lending balances 
-
 
they went from 48 to 60, we 
would expect to continue to grow the loan b
alances. Clearly mortgage will 
probably slow down a little bit given the increase in rates, but SBL and the 

average earning asset growth that will drive that.
 
Then lastly, this year 
we do expect to get a little bit of a lift from rates, 


half a rate increase. Now we obviously have 
two rate increases, and to the 
degree that those get realized, that will clearly help that NII line in wealth.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Okay, great. Thanks very much.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, and as a reminder ladies and gentlemen 
[Operator Instructions]. 
In the interest of time, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one 
question and one follow
-
up question. You may then re
-
enter the queue by 
pressing star, one again for any further questions.
 
Our next question comes from the l
ine of Steve Chubak with Nomura. Your 
line is now open.
 
Steve Chubak
 
Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a follow
-
up relating to Jon, your last 

last strategic update that hitting the 9%
 
was really contingent on delivering 
mid
-
single digit revenue growth per year, and it looks like consensus is 
modeling somewhere closer to low single digit, so instead of your 3% to 5%, 

 
on 

revenue outlook materializes more in line with consensus.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I think that if you recall, one of the slides, we started with a 7% ROE. 
We said a billion dollar
s of expenses should add about 100 basis points of 
ROE, and therefore the revenue growth was going to generate the 
difference. We still feel very good about the target. We still have more 
progress to make on the expense side, and we would expect to keep th
ose 
expenses out of the business, so the operational leverage on those revenues 
is pretty good.
 

$9 billion and sort of, as James said, on average about an 8.5% ROE, we see 
a c
lear line of sight to that 9 to 11, and we feel pretty confident about it.
 
Steve Chubak
 
Got it, and just one quick follow
-
up relating to the wealth management 
comp guidance you guys have given. Just looking at the business, the comp 
ratio did tick down sli
ghtly this year, about 50 BPs, so continuing to grind 
that lower, but admittedly the mix, particularly towards higher margin NII, 
would have suggested that maybe we should have seen a little bit more 
progress. James, you actually alluded to some of the com
petitive dynamics 
in your prepared remarks that could drive intensifying competition. Just 
wanted to get a sense as to what factors have impacted your ability to drive 
more meaningful comp leverage, and maybe how much incremental margin 
upside we could see
 

rising column chart in terms of margin progress beyond 2017.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

$500 million in that business, or more than $5
00 million in that business last 
year. We would expect to continue to grow NII, not
--

number and so growth rates will slow down, but we feel very good about the 
margin and the net interest income opportunity, and that will clearly dr
ive 
an increase in our margin. We were 22 and change for the year, so again we 
have clear line of sight into that 23 to 25 level.
 
James Gorman
 


 
that we all want. At the same time, 
we are making some investments in the business. I mean, the bank build
-

pound foolish here. We need to invest behind the bank, we need to invest 
b
ehind that digital strategy, we need to invest behind upgrading the 

marketing efforts there.
 

not sure that wou
ld be good for the medium and long
-
term growth of the 

 
Steve Chubak
 
And how far along are you in terms of those investments? Are they largely 
completed at this point, or should we expect that to be ongo
ing?
 
James Gorman
 

--


business mix itself will dictate a decline in the comp ratio, as will further 
growth because th
e incremental expense costs on the further revenue 
growth are obviously relatively attractive.
 
Steve Chubak
 
Thanks so much for taking my questions.
 
James Gorman
 
Sure.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, and our next question comes from the line 
of Mike Mayo with 
CLSA. Your line is now open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi, I just want a clarification. Your ROE target of 9 to 11% is for the calendar 

to getting to that ROE?
 
James Gorman
 
Well Mike, I think when we set that target, and we stand by it, it was 

the presentation a year ago. one of them was 3 to 5% revenue growth, one 
of them was continued progress o
n our capital return, because obviously 
ROE is a function of both the equity and the earnings, and the third was no 
one
-
time large enforcement
-
slash
-
litigation
--
you know, financial crisis
-
type 
events. This year, we saw zero revenue growth, or maybe 1%, I t
hink. We 
saw no one
-
time large
-
slash
-
enforcement litigation events, and we were 
able to increase our capital, but we still accreted capital interestingly. Even 

 


difficult revenue environment this year, we stand by our original predictions 

5% revenue growth to get there, but certainly if we had a negative re
venue 

 
Mike Mayo
 

equities for sure, and it looks like a little bit in fixed income. Is that from 

uropean banks, is that the 
sustainable?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So Mike, yes
--
I mean, as you said, we put up over $8 billion in equities and 
$5 billion in fixed income. The equity pool in terms of the revenue or the 
wallet looks like it will shrink for the year 
-
 

results yet, and we had the opposite phenomenon in fixed income where it 
looks like the pools have been getting a little bit bigger sort of quarter to 
quarter.
 

cern, but 

focused on is keeping the global network intact as we restructured and 
changed our businesses around the globe, and I think that global network is 

ve seen others around the globe sort of 

coming from any particular competitor, but we do feel good about the shares 
that we have and the momentum we have in those businesses.
 
Mike Ma
yo
 
And then last follow
-
up, James, you mentioned the 10
-
year retention for 

and when that could impact results?
 
James Gorman
 
When we did the deal, Mike, in I believe it was closed in the 
early
--
mid
-
January of 2009, we did the deal, we put in place a retention program which 

moving financial advisors across platforms and creating a reasonable 
amount of disruption at tha
t point in time. We moved all of the financial 
advisors ultimately onto a new platform, those from the original Dean Witter 
franchise, those from Morgan Stanley, and those from Smith Barney. The 
net impact was several thousand financial advisors at that po
int were given 
a deal, a retention deal depending on size of business, shaped sort of the 

-
 
nine or 10 

it is in J
anuary of 2018, if memory serves me, so
--
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Nineteen.
 
James Gorman
 

-
 

of the nine
-
year deal. Some of those financial advisors in the meantime have 
retired; a smal
l number have moved onto other employment, so the annual 




done.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Right, thank you.
 
James Gorman
 
Sure.

with UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One quick one here on ROE, 
or act
ually it might not be all that quick. So I get it that there is some 
uncertainty in the revenue environment, but you guys highlighted it seems 
like momentum continues to improve, specifically FIC looks stable, 
exceeding targets with lower capital, equities
 
strong, and II starting to 
benefit from rate uplift, and risk appetite is expanding and transactional 
revenues are starting to improve in wealth management. So
--
and then 


 
highlighted regulation and a desire to cut back.
 
So in light of all that, how should we think about the ROE guide? It certainly 
seems like the low end given those factors would be quite easy for you, and 
how should we think about that new administration a
nd potential benefits 
from lesser regulatory burdens?
 
James Gorman
 
Well Brennan, I think you just outlaid the bull case. The bear case would be 

which creates enough confusion in 
the minds of potential issuers that the 

reason does not crystallize, given some of the changes on the political front, 
including potential tax reform, et cetera. So you know, I think

all working hard here to get the ROE up higher. We have been explicit in 

our

Societe Generale. Your line is now open.
 
Andrew Lim
 
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if we 
could return to the NII sensitivity. It would be nice to get some mea
sure of 
how much your NII would increase for, say, a 100 basis point parallel 
upward shift in the curve. I think you did something along those lines in the 
1Q fixed income presentation last year, so perhaps you can give an update 
on that. And then just tog
ether with that, perhaps give a sense of how 
sensitive you are to the short end increasing versus the long end 
-
 
are you 
predominantly sensitive to the short end increasing and then hoping that 
that short end increases in tandem with what the curve is indi
cating?
 
Then
--
sorry, just a second question, if I may. Your CET1 ratio was virtually 
unchanged on the quarter despite the strong earnings, and I was just 
wondering if you could talk a bit more about any negative OCI impacts 
coming from [indiscernible] valu
ation adjustments. Could you also talk about 
how you view excess capital? I think [indiscernible] on the same page as 
seen as having a lot of excess capital, but the question mark is how much? 
What are you waiting for in terms of having that return to shar
eholders 
-
 
more clarity on the regulatory front, maybe the stress capital buffer 
becoming more a tangible part of capital ratios? If you could talk about that 

 
James Gorman
 

 
and glad to see we 

of these and we can follow up offline.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

--
as you know, on the capital return, we just re
-
submitted our CCAR submission. We

continue to increase our capital return. In our disclosure, you can see what 
we have in parent capital, and we would like to continue
--
as our earnings 
grow, we would like to continue to return more capital to shareholder
s.
 
The second point I would make on your Tier 1, I think it was your CET 1 

--
our buyback and our preferred and 
common dividends sort of offset our earnings, and then you saw a 
movement in our AOTI. We have about a $60 billi
on AFS portfolio 
throughout the organization, and that caused about a $700 million, give or 
take, after
-
tax impact. So all the earnings net of the buybacks and the 
dividends and the AOTI sort of ended up in a flat place.

Michael Carrier
 
Right, thanks guys. Just a few on wealth management, and some of these 
are just clean

ups; but I think, Jon, you mentioned some expense
 
items in 
this quarter. I think it was related to something on tax, something
--
some 
tax issues, but I just wanted to make sure we had that amount, if you had 
it. Then on the net interest income, any color on, just given the strength in 
the quarter, how muc
h was maybe non

core, like prepayment, stuff like

I think it was 150 basis 
points, it was like $1.1 billion TBT, but any update just on the sensitivity 
there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 


came from me. In terms of the other questions

back?
 
Michael Carrier
 
Yeah, it was just the expense item. I think you mentioned there was 
something in wealth management.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yeah. I think we

as you can see from the non

comp expenses, that gives 
you a sense of sort of the magnitude. The full

year TBT was 22. We feel 
good about the 23 to 25% margin in that business going forward, and we

in the bank. You will see that in the results in the wealth management

that will obviously help the margin in that business.

JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Thanks
. Good morning James, Jon. A couple quick ones here. So in wealth 

the strategy as a move towards focusing on clients that are interested in a 
full digital relationship. Just curious if
 
we should think about that as maybe 
expanding the customer base to smaller levels of investable assets, just 
because those will become more economic. Just trying to think about what 
that comment means.
 
James Gorman
 
Well you know, I think that there has ob
viously been an evolution in this 

that we deal with and aspire to deal with are people who are attracted to the 
intellectual capital and product offerings that a firm like Morgan Sta
nley has, 
so we have disproportionately much larger households among our 2, $2.1 
trillion of assets, a very large percentage of them in household above $10 

digital technology to s
upport the financial advisors and the branch 
operations and delivering online capability and services to those clients.
 
At the same time, there are clients who want to deal with a digital
-
only 

client base. We 

to be a large part of our business 
-
 

pure online or direct player, but we have that capability.
 
I think the biggest opportun
ity, however, exists with providing online 
capability to existing clients who want a multi
-
channel relationship with us.
 
Devin Ryan
 

downtick in FA headcount. On the other hand,
 
you had, it looks like, a record 
quarter of productivity, which was good to see. Just curious if you can give 
any thoughts around headcount trends from here, the outlook for recruiting? 
I suspect maybe the deal wells had a load of negative impact on that,
 
but 
curious where we go from here.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yeah, listen 
-
 
I think as you know, the FA headcount bounces around a little 

is sort of in and around this level. We have see
n a slowdown in recruiting, 
both in terms of ins and outs. The net impact has been a little bit, as you see 

comfortable with and that the recruiting environment has cert
ainly slowed 
down over the last couple quarters here.

Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom 
with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Thanks very much. So my question is basically about the levers 
to
--
in which 
optimized can be
--
you know, capital can be more fully optimized. I guess 
the two parts of my question are, on the one hand, as long as the CCAR 
process exists, obviously there will be constraints on how much capital 
presumably can be returned 
in any given period of time; and on the other 

-

consuming less RWA than it has historically. So is there anything that can be 
done in which RWA can be generated in a way that consumes this
 
capital 

experience is?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 


ccretes, 
which it did accrete over the course of the year, we can try to continue to 
support our client base. We have capital capacity to increase our balance 


 
in the past. Clearly over the last couple years, our 
balance sheet has sort of been flat to down, but as we see some increased 
activity and client activity across the globe, there is an opportunity to invest 

nother area that potentially 
looks like there could be an opportunity this year, whereas I would say last 

 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Got it, so that was actually my follow
-

think 
there might be a bit more opportunity for balance sheet growth?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, I think we enter this year with more of a half
-
full optimism, as 
opposed to if you recall in the first quarter of last year when we set out 
these targets and these
 
guidelines. We were in a very different and difficult 
environment, and it was a very much half
-
empty environment with sort of 
disruption and not really functioning markets. Today, markets are open and 
functioning, and there is this new sense of optimism. 
So if that continues, 
there should be potentially opportunity to increase the size of the balance 
sheet.

Hi, g

t are 
based on historical practices, and we obviously have seen also money 
market reform and some changes in the structure of the markets. I would 
say in terms of how we think about our beta today, Fiona, again I think my 
comments have generally been that 
we think the beta is about 50, and I 

--
excuse me, a 
reasonable estimate. Realized betas on the first two hikes have clearly been 
lower, but we think 50 is probably as good an estimate as any, an

have to see how it plays out and what actually happens to rates.
 
James Gorman
 

probably need a little more time to digest. This is a bit of a moving 
chessboard here. We like the
 
U.K., we like the rule of law in the U.K., we like 
having our businesses there, and our aspiration is to keep as much of our 
business there as possible; but to the extent we have to comply with 

omewhere in 
continental Europe, and that will have some implications going forward. But

Hi. There has been a lot of focus on the asset sensitivity within the wealth 
management unit specifically, but I was wond
ering if you could comment on 
how the overall balance sheet is positioned for rising rates, including the 
institutional securities unit and investment management. Just thinking about 
the aggregate balance sheet.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, well I think that most 
of the
--
most of that sensitivity is in wealth, and 
will sort of be seen in that segment reporting wealth line. The institutional 

really how we think about that business, nor in sor
t of how it plays out in 
light of the sales and trading nature of that business.
 
Broadly speaking, rising rates in terms of what that is as a function of global 
growth rates and/or volatility will impact the sales and trading business; but 
again, most of t
he sensitivity lies within our wealth business because most of 
the assets outside of wealth are floating rate assets matched with floating 
rate liabilities.
 

 
Okay, and then the follow
-
up, just in the institutional securities, we saw the 
net in
terest income there go down; but is that more just the mix shift in 
terms of how clients are paying more in fees versus the interest income, or 
is there more of a liability sensitive position there?

how we look at that business, so the wealth is the real are

Certainly. Our next question comes 
from the line of Richard Bove with 
Rafferty Capital. Your line is now open.
 
Richard Bove
 
Thank you. You had a very impressive quarter in terms of earnings growth, 
clearly, in the fourth quarter, but at the end of the day your common equity 
was down, which 
has been true of every one of the major universal banks. 

basis, I guess, certainly 2017 and beyond, how do you get common equity 
to go up?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So, how do we get common e

common equity flat, as we think we have sufficient capital to run our 
businesses based on the current size, shape and risk profile of the company. 
We have been increasing our capital return to try to achieve th
at. As you 
point out, this quarter we were impacted by a movement in our AFS 
portfolio, as well as some movements in DBA as our credit spreads 
tightened. Those movements are going to be volatile depending on what 
happens to rates and what happens to spread
s; but again, our goal here is 
to try to keep capital pretty flat going forward.
 
Richard Bove
 
Yeah, but if interest rates keep rising and if the impact is similar to what you 
saw in the fourth quarter, your common equity is going to continue to fall. If 
your common equity continues to fall, in answer to an earlier question you 

be able to expand the size of the balance sheet to take 

get common equity to stabilize or rise in a rising interest rate environment.
 
In other words, you may be able to get an in
creased benefit in terms of 
asset sensitivity from some of your business lines, but from the balance 

than it was on September 30. How do people benefit if the piggybank keeps 
getti
ng smaller?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well again, I think we did accrete capital, average capital and absolute 
capital over the course of 2016. We started the beginning of the year 2016 
saying that we were capital sufficient, so we have more capital than when 
we mad
e those comments, so we can continue to leverage that capital. Our 
capital
--
our average equity was down $400 million, I think, quarter over 

We still have more capital today than
 
we did at December 31, and we 
continue to believe we have capital capacity to invest in our business and 
grow our business.

Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with 
Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
 
M
att Burnell
 
Thanks for taking my question. Two relatively quick ones, I hope. First of all, 
Jon, in investment management, obviously the fourth quarter numbers were 
a little bit skewed by the loss, but first of all, can you tell us a little more 
detail as 

above the 40% target for comp to net revenues in that business, and how 
confident are you, you can get to that by 2017?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

--
let me take the first one fi
rst. As we said, these were non
-
core investments. They were capital intensive. They were limited partner 
investments 
-
 

They were investments that were made going on 10 years ago when we 
made the ri
sk decision to exit those positions, and we did and sort of took 
the charge that you saw in the fourth quarter of $60 million. So absent that 
charge, obviously better results in that business 
-
 
stable asset fees, stable 
asset management fees, and would hav
e been a better investment line was 
it not for that charge that we took. Again, those were decisions based on
--
risk decisions that we decided to exit those positions.
 
In terms of the comp ratio, to be fair, as you know, carry runs through that 
line item, s


--
you know, depending on what the 
investment environment is, it sort of perverts if we have a lot of carry gains. 

come will be a lot higher, so that target 

environment.
 
The one thing I will tell you is that if you look at
--

to parse this through the different line items, but the n
on
-
carry related comp 
expense is actually down as a percentage of the fee
-
based revenue, so we 
are exhibiting good expense discipline in that business, but it will be volatile 
based on carry and investment gains. So not a great target that we had out 
there

around the non
-
carry related comp.

James Gorman
 
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We 
sincerely hope that you, your families, and your colleagues are all well in 
these very difficult times. We're obviously in the middle of a public health 
crisis, one that is devastating to many. And along with it, the world is being 
tested from a humanitari
an, economic, and financial perspective. As long as 
the duration and scale of the pandemic and economic slowdown remains 
uncertain, I expect markets will continue to be fragile. The resulting stress 
on the global economy is real and will take time to recov
er.
 
The speed of the actions taken by policymakers has been remarkable. 
Central banks acted swiftly around the globe. The policies have been 
thoughtful. Fiscal stimulus measures and support for small businesses and 
individuals have been put into place. And
 
unlike the global financial crisis, 
the banking system is being leveraged to be a critical part of the solution. 
The Federal Reserve and other central banks are taking steps to support the 
economy and we wanted to do our part. In March, we voluntarily sus
pended 
share repurchases. We do not expect to restart these repurchases until we 
have a better understanding of the shape and depth of the economic 
recovery. Despite these extremely challenging times, our businesses held up 
remarkably well.
 
Of course, we s
aw an increase in our credit provisions and declines in 
investment revenues in Investment Management. And there were natural 
consequences of the market turmoil, namely the decline in deferred 
compensation plan investments and increase in the amount of prep
ayment 
amortization. Notwithstanding all of this, the firm generated $9.5 billion of 
revenues and an ROTCE of 9.7%. Importantly, the operating plan functioned 
well. The results serve as a testament to the stability of the business mix 
and the balance we wo
rked diligently to achieve over the last decade.
 
Ultimately, the outlook is much more important than the last couple of 
months. Shorter term, the decline in asset prices, zero interest rates and the 
potential slowdown in activity levels will have an impact
. With respect to our 
strategic objectives, which we outlined our goals at the beginning of the 
year, we said we assumed a normal market environment. This environment 
is anything but normal. Given the circumstances, the objectives we laid out 
would take lo
nger to achieve. We will have much greater visibility to discuss 
these objectives towards the end of this year. Despite these short
-
term 
challenges, our franchise is strong, our strategy is clear and consistent. 
Coming into this, we were conservatively pos
itioned and this remains true 
today.
 

our employees and I are working hard to do our best to support our clients 
and communities. We've benefitted in this period from robust busine
ss 
planning and from years of investment in our technology infrastructure. 
These teams are doing an unbelievable job in this environment. We adapted 
quickly to a new way of life. Over 90% of our employees are currently 
working from home as we continue to s
erve our clients globally.
 
I frequently speak of the strength of Morgan Stanley's culture and our 
tenured leadership team. During periods of crisis, that matters even more. 
Our operating committee has worked together in various ways for over a 
decade. Near
ly all of us were at Morgan Stanley during the financial crisis. 
The strength of those relationships enabled our team to react to recent 
events in an expedited, coordinated manner, allowing us to quickly pivot to a 
work
-
from
-
home model. We will be equally 
thoughtful as we think about a 
path towards returning to work, whenever that is deemed safe by health 
officials and our local governments. I could not be proud of this firm. It is 
during times like this that you take a measure of an organization, and my 
es
teem for Morgan Stanley is now even higher than it was before. We will all 
get through this, and we will have all learned a great deal. And in the 
meantime, we will continue to do our part for broader society.
 
I will now turn the call over to Jon to discus
s the results of the first quarter 
in greater detail, our perspectives on the outlook given the current 

Thank you. Jon?

Thank you, James, and good morning.
 
In the first q
uarter, firm revenues were $9.5 billion, down 13% sequentially. 
First quarter PBT was $2.1 billion and EPS was a $1.01 resulting in an 
ROTCE of 9.7%. Our business mix and strategy, which emphasizes more 
durable sources of revenues, supported our results du
ring the recent market 
disruption.
 
The quarter was divided in two distinct periods: January and February were 
characterized by buoyant risk assets, rising markets, and engaged clients; 
March proved to be unprecedented. As the COVID
-
19 virus spread globally
 
and shelter
-
in
-
place orders became common, we saw significant volatility, 
volumes and market dysfunction. Historical relationships broke down and 
liquidity dried up. Clients reacted by reducing risk and raising cash. The 
Federal Reserve and central banks 
acted quickly and aggressively with large 
scale and targeted actions to restore market mechanics and liquidity. During 
this time, we remain close to our clients as we all manage through 
challenges together. We moved swiftly to a work from home strategy. 60
% 
of our employees were working from home by mid
-
March and 90% plus 
today. Over this time period, volumes rose to 2.5 times average levels and 
margin calls rose to 4x times the average levels.
 
Our technology and operations performed quite well. During this
 
period of 
volatility, we also risk
-
managed well. With market function and liquidity 
essentially restored, clients are weighing the major factors at play, including 
significant unemployment and economic disruption versus monetary and 
fiscal actions larger 
than any others in history.
 
During this period, the firm extended credit and intermediated trading, 
responding to client needs and supporting open and functioning markets. 
First, we extended credit to clients across the firm. We financed key 
transactions t
o help COVID
-
impacted clients across sectors including 
transportation, healthcare, leisure, and consumer among others. We also 
saw approximately $13 billion gross draw
-
downs, $5 billion of new facilities 
in corporate lending, and $3 billion in retail commi
tments.
 
We supported our clients by trading 
--
 
intermediating trading, including 
managing record volumes across voice and MSET. In March, Morgan Stanley 
was an underwriter of over $70 billion of corporate and municipal bonds 
globally. Additionally, we cont
inue to work with clients to access the new 
Federal Reserve and treasury programs to meet their financing needs.
 
We remain focused on managing our controllable expenses. Total non
-
interest expenses were $7.3 billion for the quarter. Non
-
compensation 
expens
es were $3.1 billion while compensation expenses were $4.3 billion. 
We tightly managed professional services spend and saw declines in 
marketing business development, given the global shutdown. We continued 
our efforts to reduce dependence on contingent wo
rkers, leveraging our 
global in
-
house centers. These efforts were more than offset by increases in 
activity related expenses including BC&E and transaction taxes.
 
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities business reported 
revenues of $4.9 billio
n. Robust results in sales and trading were offset by 
markdowns on held for sale loans increased loan loss provision, and lower 
levels of investment banking activity.

compensation expenses increased 14%, driven by higher BC&E and 
transaction taxes on e
levated sales and trading volumes and an ACL on 
unfunded commitments of $115 million. In the face of uncertain markets, we 
supported our institutional clients with insightful content. Our research team 
generated almost 1.5 million interactions through writ
ten pieces, webcast 
and conference calls related to COVID
-
19. Clients remain engaged. And 
since the markets have begun to stabilize, their focus has shifted from 
macro thematic reads to interest in single name securities. Our world
-
class 
intellectual capit
al supported by innovative distribution remains a key 
differentiator when servicing clients.
 
Investment Banking generated revenues of $1.1 billion. The environment 
weighed on results across products and regions. First, underwriting activity 
was impacted as
 
the global shelter
-
in
-
place actions started to roll across the 
world, followed by significant volatility, which dampened M&A dialogue and 
announcements. Advisory revenues declined 45% sequentially, reflecting 
lower completed M&A industry volumes.
 
Equity u
nderwriting revenues were also impacted, declining 20% versus the 
previous quarter. Industry activity fell off meaningfully with global IPO 
volumes declining by over 70% compared to the prior quarter. This was 
partially offset by an increase in accelerated
 
primary offerings and secondary 
activity as we held clients across the global monetize equity stakes. Fixed 
income underwriting declined 11% versus the prior quarter. While event
-
driven activity was limited, investment grade bond issuance reached record 
l
evels, especially in March.
 
The spread of COVID
-
19 and subsequent market volatility have disrupted 
deal activity. However, new issue markets are slowly opening with a few 
IPOs and high yield deals being completed over the last few weeks. Issuers 
continue t
o evaluate financing needs looking to strengthen their balance 
sheets and raise liquidity. We have a strong pipeline across products and 
equity underwriting and a robust pipeline in investment grade and non
-
investment grade business, which are dependent on
 
market access. We 

other markets continue to open around the globe.
 
Equity sales and trading is number one globally and revenues increased 26% 
sequentially to $2.4 billion with strong 
performance across all business lines 
and particular strength in Asia.
 
Cash results were robust, reflecting the nearly 50% increase in global 
market volumes compared to the prior year. Derivative revenues increased 
sequentially as we facilitated client nee
ds during periods of severe market 
dislocation. Partially offsetting the results were losses on collateral calls and 
announcements in Europe of interruptions to dividends. In March, 40% of 
the euro stocks announced dividend cuts or suspensions in 2020.
 
Pri
me brokerage performed well on higher levels of activity, partially offset 
by slightly lower average balances. In mid
-
February, we reached a record 
level of gross balances, only to then see a sharp reversal. In late March, we 
reached a recent low in balanc
es as market levels declined and we saw 
clients significantly degross. [Ph] We entered the second quarter with lower 
spot balances, down close to 30% and a more challenged environment in 
Europe.
 
Fixed income sales and trading produced revenues of $2.2 bill
ion, increasing 
73% from the prior quarter. Strong client activity in macro and commodities 
drove robust results. Multiyear efforts to reshape this business, focusing on 
deepening client penetration, increasing velocity of balance sheet and 
greater trading
 
discipline contributed to the results. Macro performance was 
very strong across products, particularly over the last weeks of the quarter. 
The business benefitted from higher levels of client activity and wider bid 
offer spreads. Micro revenues were more 
challenged and declined 
sequentially. Performance was strong within credit corporate, which saw 
good velocity. However, this was offset by markdowns on inventory in munis 
and securitized products, which were negatively impacted by the dislocated 
market and
 
significantly wider spreads. Strong commodity results were 
supported by increased client activity, driven by meaningful swings in energy 
and metal prices.
 
Other sales and trading increased significantly in the quarter. This line 
includes economic hedges o
n our held for sale loans, which benefitted from 
the spread widening. This was partially offset by movements related to 
deferred cash compensation plans, which is also recognized in this line.
 
Losses in investments were driven by a markdown on a 
commodities 
investment that was impacted by movements in energy markets. And losses 
within other revenues reflect mark to market adjustments on held for sale 
loans and a provision for credit losses for funded held for investment loans.
 
Looking across other
 
sales and trading and other revenues, three main 
factors drove approximately $1.1 billion of losses embedded in these two 
lines. First, mark to market losses net of hedges on our $47 billion held for 
sale portfolio; second, ACL associated with our $49 bil
lion funded HFI 
portfolio. Together, the ACL provision and mark to market net of hedges 
accounted for approximately $900 million of the aforementioned loss. And 
third, losses from investments associated with employee deferred cash base 
compensation plans r
epresent approximately $200 million of the loss.
 
Now, I will give some more color around our CECL provisioning for our $49 
billion held for investment loan portfolio. Provisions for loan losses were 
$273 million and our March 31 allowance for loans was $52
9 million. This 
represents an 82% increase versus our day
-
one CECL allowance. We had 
approximately $32 million of charge
-
offs or 7 basis points, representing our 
first charge
-
off in the last 15 months. And as you can see on page 10 of the 
financial supplem
ent, ISG loans were $76 billion, $64 billion designated as 
loans held for investment and $36 billion held for sale or fair value. Held for 
investment loans were up $11 billion and 29%, driven almost entirely by 
corporate draw
-
downs. Of the HFI portfolio, $
15 billion is corporate, $7 
billion is commercial real estate and $26 billion are secured lending facilities. 
Our allowance for corporate loans is 1.7% and our allowance for CRE is 
2.4%.
 
Looking at the entire portfolio, including the 53% secured lending fa
cilities, 
our total allowance is 1.1%. Our secured lending portfolio has attractive look 
through LTVs and structural protections, and we are the sole lender on 
approximately two
-
thirds of this portfolio.
 
Now turning to Wealth Management. We reported first 
quarter revenues of 
$4 billion and pretax profit of $1.1 billion. The pretax profit margin was 
26.1%. In the quarter, however, results were materially impacted by two 
negative factors, movements in investments associated with employee 
deferred cash based c
ompensation plans and prepayment amortization. The 
combined impact was approximately $500 million to revenues and 150 basis 
points to margin. The underlying fundamentals of this business remain quite 
strong.
 
As indicated in our Form 10
-
K, as of February 20
20, we had granted 
approximately $3 billion of deferred compensation obligations for Wealth 
Management employees. The notional value of these awards is allocated at 

generally 60% is he
ld in equity investments.
 
Given the S&P index declined 20% in the first quarter, the negative revenue 
impact was elevated. While changes in compensation expense related to 
these investments will generally be offset by changes in revenue, there can 
be some 
timing differences due to vesting schedules in a given period.
 
Transactional revenues were $399 million. After excluding the impact of DCP 
transactional revenues was up more than 15% versus prior quarters. Client 
activity was extremely strong, reflecting h
igh levels of engagement 
throughout the quarter as clients repositioned portfolios and moved into 
cash and other short
-
term securities. Today, clients hold approximately 23% 
of assets in cash and short
-
term securities.
 
Asset management revenues increased s
lightly from the prior quarter. 
Higher asset levels at the beginning of the first two months of the quarter 
helped insulate these revenues from the subsequent market decline in 
March. Total client assets of $2.4 trillion declined 11% sequentially, largely 
on market depreciation. Positive flows partially offset these lower asset 
levels. We had fee
-
based flows of $18 billion and generated strong net new 
assets at a pace above our historical run rate, highlighting the stability and 
health of this business. We 
saw improvements in new asset flows over an 

 
Our growth strategy is working as clients are seeking professional advice 
during turbulent times, particularly with increased complexity. Strong lo
an 
growth continued in the first quarter. Lending balances increased 15% 
versus the prior year to $83 billion, driven by tailored and mortgages. The 
loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well. We saw elevated margin 
calls in the quarter with limite
d losses. The mortgage portfolio had 90
-
day 
plus delinquencies decline slightly to 21 basis points.
 
Currently, we've had borrowers call for forbearance of $690 million in 
mortgage loans or less than 2%. Our smallest portfolio, the $14 billion tailor 
book i
s also performing well with just a handful of special mentioned loans.
 
Net interest income declined 13% to $896 million. The benefits of higher 
lending and the $31 billion increase in BDP balances were more than offset 
by lower interest rates and the resul
ting higher projected moorage 
prepayments. In order to understand the impact of lower interest rates, it's 
helpful to look at our historical disclosures. At year
-
end, we disclosed that 
100 basis points instantaneous shock to interest rates would reduce NII
 
for 
the U.S. banks by approximately $640 million over the next 12 months. 
While this disclosure covers both, banks, some of which relates to ISG, the 
vast majority of the NII is in Wealth Management. Assuming rates still rise 
for the remainder of the year
, the disclosed figure is broadly representative 
of the impact of lower rates on wealth NII.
 
Total expenses were $3 billion. The sequential decline was driven by lower 
compensation expense, principally related to the movements in DCP
-
related 
investments. N
on
-
compensation expenses also declined from the fourth 
quarter, reflecting typical seasonality.
 
Finally, we continue to make progress on the integration of Solium now part 
of Morgan Stanley at Work. This offering is resonating with corporate clients. 
In th
e quarter, we added over 100 new clients to the platform for stock plan 
and financial wellness services, bringing the total new clients since we 
announced the acquisition to over 455.
 
Investment Management reported revenues of $692 million in the first 
qua
rter. We had extensive engagement with our global clients throughout 
the quarter and the business continues to see strong net flows, despite the 
challenging environment. Total AUM rose 6% to $584 billion. Long
-
term net 
flows were $6.7 billion, driven by ca
pital being deployed within alternatives 
and inflows into public equity and fixed income funds. Our global active 
concentrated equity strategies continue to outperform their benchmarks. 
Total net flows of $57 billion benefitted from a significant new long
-
term 
client partnership and our liquidity business.
 
Asset management fees is $665 million, declined 10% sequentially. Higher 
management fees on higher average AUM were more than offset by lower 
performance fees. As a reminder, performance fees are mostly r
ecognized in 

Investment revenues were $63 million in the quarter. We saw meaningful 
markdowns in reversals of carried interest in our real estate infrastructure 
and PE funds offset by a si
gnificant gain in an underlying investment subject 
to sales restrictions within our Asia private equity fund. Also of note, the 
business was able to see some successful modernizations despite the 
difficult environment.
 
Total expenses decreased 40% sequenti
ally, largely driven by lower accrued 
carried interest compensation. Non
-
compensation expenses also declined on 
lower BC&E and professional service expenses.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets rose to $948 billion as we 
deployed our balance sh
eet to support clients during this challenging period 
and retail clients saw safety, increasing our deposits by $45 billion. 
Advanced RWAs increased to $426 billion, while standardized RWAs 
increased to $416 billion. The increase in RWAs was driven primari
ly by 
increased client trading activity and market volatility as well as lending. As a 
result, our advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio, which is our applicable 
ratio for the first quarter declined to 15.3. As a reminder, our stressed 
capital buffer will be
 
calculated off of our standardized approach which was 
15.7.
 
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares or $1.3 
billion of common stock and the Board declared a $0.35 dividend per share. 
Our tax rate was 18.5% for the quarter, exc
luding $31 million of intermittent 
net discrete tax benefits. Our tax rate will increase in subsequent quarter 
and we continue to expect our full year 2020 tax rate will be approximately 
22% to 23%. With respect to our intent to acquire ETRADE, the HSR wai
ting 
period has expired. We filed our application with the Federal Reserve in 
March and we will soon file the proxy statement prospectus. ETRADE will 
hold the shareholder vote this summer and we remain on track to close the 
transaction in the fourth quarte
r.
 
Taken in full, we are very pleased with the Firm's results and stability of the 
business model. We will continue to benefit from the significant repositioning 
of our balance sheet and business strategy over the last decade. Our client
-
driven model combi
ned with strong capital and liquidity will help deliver 
relative earnings strength in this uncertain environment. But, there are 
several factors that will impact our earnings power in the near term, 
including lower asset values and balances, interest rates
 
near zero as well as 
volatility and economic uncertainty impacting capital markets and M&A 
volumes.
 
The second half of the year remains uncertain and the path of the economy 
will be driven by the time it takes to resolve the health crisis and the impact 
o
f the unprecedented fiscal and monetary response.
 
With that, we will now open the line for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christian Bolu with 
Autonomous. Your line is now open.
 
Christia
n Bolu
 

good to hear that.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you, Christian.
 
Christian Bolu
 
My first question is on ROTCE for the firm. How to think about downside 
ROTCE? I mean, given you are 
putting up 10% ROTCE in what is a very 
choppy backdrop, how should investors now think about the downside case 
for the firm? Is a 10% or close to 10% ROTCE now your bottom line as 
opposed to a couple of years ago where that was your actual long
-
term 
target
?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, Christian, let me take a go at it, and the way, we're all coordinating 
from different locations here. So, if Jon and I have a little logistical mess
-
up, 
forgive us, but I can see him on the screen. So, I think, we'll manage 
through. We
're in a most unprecedented environment. I mean, if you'd said 
three months ago that 90% of our employees will be working from home 
and the firm would be functioning fine, I'd say that is a test I'm not prepared 
to take because the downside of being wrong 
on that is massive. If you'd 
said that every restaurant around the country would be shut over a two
-
week period and remain closed, I would say it's just not physically possible. 
So, we're seeing 
--
 
you saw the jobs numbers, the applications for 
unemploymen
t benefits, et cetera coming through. We're in an extraordinary 
period. So, listen, what I look at is, how do the businesses perform 
underlying in this environment? How do we trade through it, what was our 
risk exposure and how do we manage that, where do 
we take hits across the 
various parts of the plant? And you're going to take them whether it's in the 
margin book, whether it's in the asset management portfolios, whether it's 
in the trading businesses and how did all of that look.
 
Now, we didn't have a f
ull quarter of being in absolute crisis, we had a half 
quarter or two thirds of the quarter being in absolute crisis. But boy, it was 

$9.5 billion of revenue, and that's net of th
e deferred compensation plans, 
which actually puts us a bit over of $10 billion in revenue, effectively flat to 
a year ago. I thought it was remarkable. Now, maybe it's my job to think 
that's remarkable, but I do think it was remarkable. I think, the stabi
lity and 
breadth of the franchise, the diversification clearly showed that we have an 
underlying sort of backstop of our performance. I can't tell you it's 10% 

volume, we have lower inte
rest rates, we have lower asset prices at the 

lower non
-
comp expenses I suspect in the second quarter for a variety of 
reasons. So, there will be a lot of things going back and forwar
d.
 
So, is 10% a bottom? I don't want to call that now, because I just don't 
know how deep this recession is going to be. But, given what we went 
through to produce that felt like a really resilient franchise.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Great, okay. Thank you. And then
, my follow
-
up, maybe this one is more for 
Jon. On the deposits, you had a pretty big surge in deposits, and I'm trying 
to just maybe size potential tailwind to funding cost over time. So, could you 
remind us how much of your 
--
 
how much high cost deposits
 
you still have 
on the books today? Maybe, what the blended costs of those high cost 
deposits are versus sort of the swift deposits that are coming in the door?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Sure. And we did see a surge in deposits in March, almost $30 billion in the 
month o
f March alone, and the balances are up $45 billion for the quarter. 
Now, it's generally a result of people shifting out of equities and going into 
cash in the wealth system. You can see I think on page 11 of the 
supplement, Christian, the various balances 
in the banks. Right now, most of 
that excess cash 
--
 
excuse me, excess deposits is actually sitting in cash. 
You can see we've 
--
 
we increased our loans a little bit. We've increased our 
securities portfolio a little bit, but most of that cash is undeploye
d. And we'll 
have to see around the resilience of that. Our expectation is that it will be 
pretty sticky for a while. But again, depending on what our clients do as 
investment options, that might come down a bit, but it clearly puts us in a 
much better pos
ition. I think, our BDP, which is our cheapest source of 
deposits, which currently have a cost of 1 basis point is now about 65% of 
the portfolio. It was close to the 60 or 58 a little while ago. Our high cost 
deposits, I think the blend between the CDs an
d some of the other products 
we have in there, is about 160 basis points. And so, obviously as we can 
shift more the BDP, that will be significantly beneficial. And I think, our 
deposit costs at the end of the quarter were about 56 or 57 basis points, and 
those should come down a little bit as we've just repriced our savings 
product down in light of the rate environment.
 
So, I would say, we should 
--
 
if we have the opportunity to deploy those 
deposits into loans, we'll see a benefit there clearly, but we're
 
going to be 
cautious and just see have those deposits behave for a little while before we 
sort of fully deploy them.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your 
line is now open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. How are you 

call and good to hear that you're on the meds. Hope you're feeling better.
 
James Gorman
 
Thanks Bren. I appreciate it.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
So, could you speak a bit, maybe Jon, you gave some color on the $49 
billion 
HFI portfolio, which is helpful. Thanks. Could you speak to the 
allocation of that portfolio to some of those sectors that are considered 
higher risk? And if you've seen or received any forbearance requests from 
any of those borrowers, or you're seeing any
 
other 
--
 
any kind of early 
indications of risk or stress in any of those 
--
 
tied to any of those loans?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Sure. I'll take a crack. On the allocation, the corporate book, the vulnerable 
sectors, those are evolving pretty rapidly in terms of which 
sectors are being 
hit. But clearly, energy, auto, air travel, lodging, leisure, retail on our 
corporate book, which totals about $108 billion, we probably have $10 billion 
or $11 billion to those sectors. Obviously, there'll be different caliber in 
terms o
f the ratings across those $10 billion or $11 billion. You heard me 
talk about the increase in the reserve for the funded loans. We increased for 
the quarter to bring our reserve level on funded loans up to 1.7 there. What 
we did see is the funded loans go
 
up by about $15 billion. That $15 billion 
was actually more skewed to investment grade, about 45% of that was 
investment grade, a third of it was BB, so very little single B exposure there. 
And a good chunk of the BB in some of what we 
--
 
the new stuff we
 
put out 
were actually secured and well collateralized.
 
So, we do 
--
 
so, we have taken provisions there. We've also 
--
 
as you heard 
from my comments, marked those loans that are held for sale. We took 
about 
--
 
net of our hedge is about $600 million of mark
s on that held for 
sale portfolio. And then, the last point I would make is on the forbearance. 
Where we've seen some forbearance asks, really have been in the 
commercial real estate book, which is only 
--
 
it's about $11 billion in total, 
20% of that is in
 
hotels and retail. We've had 16 requests or about $1.4 
billion of loans request forbearance. We would expect that number to go up 
as we get into the May and June payments. But, at this point, it's a very 
high quality portfolio. It's about 58% LTVs to the 
top tier borrowers in the 
real estate business. And we have a good protection in the assets. So, the 
forbearance has mostly been, Brennan, in the CRE book right now and then 
again, a little bit in the residential mortgage that I mentioned.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Y
es. Okay. Thanks for all that color. I really appreciate that, Jon. So, another 
question and my follow
-
up, you committed, James, that there is not going to 
be any risk this year, which you can appreciate the idea that this would 
reassure your employees in 
extremely challenging time. It makes a 
commitment to ensure continued health coverage for your employees, which 
is tied to employment in this country and given what we're facing, you can 
appreciate. But 
--
 

compe
nsation being a big part. But, how is that going to come into play with 
controlling of expenses, which is obviously a big factor when you're coming 
into or likely coming into a recession year and being part of investment 
bank, obviously expense control bec
omes big. So how do you adjust those 
things and what levers are you thinking to pull on the expense side here as 
the revenue 
--
 
if the revenue environment continues to get difficult?
 
James Gorman
 

ke a lot of 
decisions, you get some really, really hard ones, and you get some others. I 
would put this in one of easiest decisions I've ever made. And by the way, it 
was unanimous call of our operating committee. We're in a 100
-
year crisis 
right now. And 
it's a health crisis first and foremost. And the personal 
anxiety and stress to our employees and to their families can be 
overwhelming. And we thought guaranteeing their jobs this year and getting 
the support that we have from our employees, 92% of them i
n previous 

brainer and extremely shareholder friendly. The worst possible thing you can 
show in a crisis is the lack of leadership and support for the people upon 
whom you depend to g
et the job done. So, this was to me a really easy call. 
If it means that expense ratio is 1 point higher for the year, which is maybe 

with the rift. So, the actual economics thro
ugh the year are not so obvious 

term massive prices and a longer term recession of some time, and we'll talk 

d idea 
to do a major rift this year. But psychologically, I think it would be a 
disaster.
 
So, we have other things we can do on the expenses and will be doing 
obviously. And non
-
comp expenses were extremely inflated in the first 
quarter. If you look at tra
nsaction taxes, if you look at BC&E, the levels of 
volumes just drove that answer. There was no way around it. As we get 
through the year, do I think that that's going to hold up? No, I don't. I think, 
our non
-
comps will be lower through the year and get b
ack to sort of 
reasonable levels. We had reasonable comp accruals for the first quarter. We 
did that because we wanted to be sure that we can get through this year 
safely and soundly and keep the organization in tact as we get better 
visibility on the rest
 
of the year. Obviously, we'll be in a better position to 
judge those accruals. But, we're very comfortable with what we did at this 
point.
 
So, we're being reasonably conservative on the expense side, meaning 
we've 
--
 
we haven't tried to chisel the 
organization in the first quarter, didn't 
feel like the right time, didn't feel necessary. And I think long term, even 
medium term, is definitely the right call for our shareholders and have had 
great support from them. I'd just tell you a personal story. 
I had hundreds 
and hundreds and hundreds of emails on that decision. One of them was 
from a lady who works here in one of our support functions. They come on 
the night before. Her husband had just been laid off from the small business 
he was working for. S
he came home, both crying and they came in the next 
morning, she got the email from us saying everybody's job is secure. And 
she was just overwhelmed. And those kinds of results at a human level, and 
we've got to remember this isn't just about 13 weeks of 
earnings, I'm much 
more focused on the integrity of this organization over the next decade or 
two decades. And this kind of thing sets that up. So, thank you for asking 
the question. It's a personal one, but it's a very important one.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. A
nd next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe 
Research. Your line is now open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Hi. Good morning. So, I wanted to start the question on the loan loss 
provision. And I was hoping you could help us frame following the significant 
provisio
n build that we saw in ISG this quarter. Just how we should be 
thinking about the provision trajectory for the remainder of this year? And 
maybe just any additional color you can give on some of the underlying 
macro assumptions that are embedded within you
r CECL model today?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Sure. I'll try to do that in a coherent way. But, you certainly know that CECL 
is model based and it's judgment based, and there's a lot of things that go 
into it, including multiple scenarios and multiple rankings and rating
s against 
those scenarios, as well as the qualitative and quantitative assessment. We 
obviously 
--
 
and just the timing of all of the events, we updated our models 
for what was going on at the time. When we got to the end of the quarter, in 
light of what wa
s 
--
 
what we were seeing in the rapidly changing sort of 
economic outlook, which at this point I would say, and James has mentioned 
it a couple of times. The range of potential outcomes is the widest I've seen 
in quite some time in terms of what's going to
 
happen in the future. And so, 
we relied heavily on the sort of qualitative and environmental reserve. And 
we looked at the downgrades, we looked at what loans we thought would be 
downgraded, the stress draw scenarios, we did some loss given default 
sensit
ivities, we looked at criticized asset trends, and we factored all of that 
into our analysis that ultimately led to the $350 million reserve build on the 
entire portfolio or a 74% increase from our day one CECL.
 
So, the economic scenarios are going to impa
ct people differently across the 
plant. As you know, the numbers I've just given you are institutional 
numbers. Our retail and wealth business had very little reserve build, given 
the performance in that portfolio in the Company. We obviously don't have 
an
y exposure to credit cards or unsecured credit. So, we're a slightly 

outlook plays out over the next couple of quarters and next couple of 
months. But clearly in June, we'll have a
 
lot more information to have a 
better sense of those models. So, we think the qualitative adjustments that 
we made are appropriate and brought our reserves to an appropriate level.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Thanks, Jon. Quite helpful. James, maybe a question for you.
 
You spoke of 
some of the risks to the target that you laid out at the start of the year, 
certainly not surprising given the world, using some of your words, is 
anything but normal. But admittedly, the message is a bit more cautious 
than maybe what you con
veyed in your March shareholder letter. And I was 
hoping you could speak to what macro and market assumptions are 
informing your more cautious outlook? I know there's a wide range of 
outcomes to consider. But, if we do see a U
-
shaped recovery beginning in 
'21, is there a path to delivering on some of the targets that you outlined at 
the start of the year?
 
James Gorman
 

assumptions on, I mean, take the $5 million 
--
 
5 million job claims this 
m
orning for unemployment benefits. I mean, this is 
--
 
we're in a wild period. 
We're going to have negative GDP of, I don't know, 30%. So, short term, 
anybody, and I don't mean to disparage anybody, but a CEO who stands by 
their short term targets that was s
et right before this virus hit, I don't know 

-
year 

targets, the pretax margin of 28 to 30, the ROTCE I think of 13 
to 15, and 
the efficiency ratio of 72%. Sure, could we beat it by the end of 2021 on 
some of these targets? Definitely. But we said and have always said, the 
targets are in normalized environment. This is not a normalized 
environment. We will not hit those
 
targets in the second quarter that I can 
promise you. We did not hit them in the first quarter. But beyond that, let's 
see how this plays out. If the equity markets recover, we're not going to 
have mortgage prepay, our non
-
comps are going to be down. Obvi
ously 
we're affected by where interest rates are. And if they change, obviously if 
there's any move, I'll put through 2021 that's enormously helpful and things 
start getting a lot more interesting 12 months from now than they are right 
now. But honestly, i
t would be irresponsible of me to recommit to those 
targets on this call.
 
Now, on the annual letter, that was different. What I was saying in the 
annual letter was these were our targets we laid out in 2019. We're not 
ignoring them. We're not hiding from t
hem. They're what we believe that the 
business will perform at in a normalized environment. And it will. I'm totally 
confident about that. But for right now, given we're dealing with an earnings 
call and the earnings outlook, right now, those targets are n
ot achievable in 
the second quarter. They weren't achieved in the first quarter. And it's too 
early to make the call on what 2021 looks like. But, Steven, to question is it 
possible? It's absolutely possible. Is it probable at this point? You could 
--
 
nobo
dy could say that it's probable. You've got to see what the environment 
plays at it.
 
Steven Chubak
 
No. Thanks for that helpful context, James.
 
James Gorman
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your 
line is now 
open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi. Thanks. Jon, maybe one quick clean up. So, you mentioned some losses 
on collateral calls. I'm just curious if it was any meaningful amount that we 
need to know about. And more curious about 
--
 
you lost almost nothing in 
'08 and maybe
 
just contextualize it. Is this 
--
 
was this a, just a sharper 
drop? Is it more produced by the quantum systematic trading side? Just 
curious, if you can contextualize that in the context of the deleveraging you 
mentioned.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Sure. And I wouldn't de
scribe the 
--
 
some of the losses that we took in the 
derivatives 
--
 
trading businesses related to the degrossing that we saw going 
on. That actually, other than the quantum and the size and the speed and 
the elevated volumes, didn't necessarily lead to tho
se types of outcomes. As 
you obviously saw during the quarter, there were significant volatility in 
certain indices and indexes, there were historical relationships that totally 
broke down, and went in different directions. So, when people, single 
strategy
 
firms struggled that their strategy wasn't working. The numbers 
were not material, but we wanted to highlight that. It wasn't all perfect 
throughout the plant. As James said, you're going to take and businesses 
where you trade and put with your clients th
e potential to take losses. And 
so, we did take some losses in that area. And then obviously the dividend 
cuts and the dividend business and the dividend season also had an impact. 
And we saw that in that equities number. But even despite those losses, we 
still generated $2.4 billion and we're number one in the world.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Great. That maybe leads into part B is with the degrossing, the number one 
in the world, having a big prime brokerage problem, big hedge fund business 
and huge client systematic t
rading business. Have you seen any releveraging 
or is the amount of leveraging consistent with how we should think about 
market adjustments, your equity adjustments going forward? I mean, is 
there a linear relationship?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
It's not really a linear 
relationship, but I would say, we have 
--
 
our equity 
clients and many of the hedge funds and quants actually performed 
reasonably well in this environment despite the volatility, we have seen 
some of the gross balances rebound from the lows that we saw in 
the end of 
March. Some of that was just participation as the market went up, but we 
have seen some people get back and engaged in the market, but it's not 
significantly a high off of those low points, but it has bounced back a little 
bit. And obviously the
 
higher market levels helps to gross balances.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Maybe one really quick one at high level on Wealth Management. When the 
results first come out, you're like, oh, revenue's down, you go through some 
of the adjustments. Obviously, you spelled out the comp thing. Were 
revenues actually at record high ex the
 
comp adjustment? I know, we got to 
deal with lower rates and lower asset levels going down. But, I'm just trying 
to get the right context. The flows were good, the margins were good all 
things considered. Are you still in that $50 million to $80 million r
ange on a 

Management?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Again, I think 
--
 
and James can jump in as well. But, I mentioned $500 
million of negative revenue. So, that puts the revenues in around $4.5 
billi
on. I don't think that's an actual record, but it certainly is a very healthy 
performance. And then, an incremental 150 basis points on the 26.1 that we 
reported is a very healthy margin. And as I discussed, the fundamentals of 
this business are quite good
. We saw a lot of incremental net new assets 
into the Firm, periods of volatility like this generally we see in our client base 
look for professional advice. They've consolidated their assets. The 
technology that we put into place has been really helpful i
n those initiatives. 
So, again, the business is fundamentally quite strong. We'll obviously have 
-
-
 
be impacted by the lower asset values and where rates are. But 
fundamentally, this business is performing quite well.
 
James Gorman
 

 
the loan book performed unbelievably well. We have 
basically no problems in a huge margin book and all the mortgage book and 
the other lending that we've done. Because it's a conservative business to 
people who are clients of ours who we know what their a
sset and liquidity 
picture is. So that was very pleasing. This was a great tough test and it 
survived it comfortably.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Thanks to both. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America. Your line is n
ow open.
 
Michael Carrier
 

predict trading. You mentioned some of the color around the equity trading 
balances, which makes sense. I guess, just any significant change on the 
fixed si
de, just to gauge the outlook here?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
I'm sorry. The outlook on 
--
 
you broke up a little bit. I think, it's our side.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Yes. I was just saying, on equity trading, you provided some color around 
lower balances, which I assume makes se
nse. I was just wondering on the 
fixed slide, any significant changes that you've seen in that business, to try 
to gauge the outlook?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Again, it's very early in the quarter. Clients are still engaged. There's a lot of 
policy debate going on. Ther
e's a lot of debate around the time of the 
potential, and the health crisis and to the shelter
-
in
-
places. There's still a lot 
of activity. But volatility is clearly more subdued, which will have an impact 
on the business. Volumes are still pretty healthy, 
but again, it's only two 
weeks into the quarter and pretty hard to speculate what's going to happen 
over the next couple of months.
 
Michael Carrier
 
All right, makes sense. And then, just as a follow
-
up, in Investment 
Management the investment line tends to
 
be more volatile. In this backdrop, 
I think you mentioned some gains that offset marks and accrue reversals. 
Can you provide any color on some of those components just so we have 
maybe a good level to go off of?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Sure. I'm just trying to find th
e line. The line was minus 
--
 
the line was $63 
million, I think. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we had one very 
substantial gain that made that line positive, similar to the gain we took in 
the 
--
 
similar 
--
 
same company that we took the gains from in t
he fourth 
quarter. But we did see losses across real estate, as you 
--
 
our real estate 
portfolios as well as some of our infrastructure and private equity funds. 
Obviously, the gain was larger than the losses. It's an investment that we've 
made in a compan
y that's gone public that we have shares. We're restricted 
from selling our stock. But that hopefully will give you some sense of the 
general sizes of those marks. But clearly, given what happened with risk 
assets and asset pricings around 
--
 
asset prices 
around the globe, we did 
see broad
-
based markdowns in most of the portfolios.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo 
Securities. Your line is now open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi. Just a 
clarification. So, you had $600 million mark to market losses, were 
those realized or simply just mark to market? And what were the loans or 
securities?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Sure, Mike. It was mark to market. We still have those loans. In the 
supplement, you can 
see the investment, ISG loan book is approximately 
$169 billion. I mentioned in my remarks there's about $47 billion that are 
held for sale. The vast majority of the marks came on the relationship book, 
the corporate loans. There were also some marks on th
e secured lending as 
well, the secured lending facilities, but we had those $600 million and losses 
were net of the hedges we have on those 
--
 
on that relationship portfolio. 
We also had a couple of hundred million dollars related to some of the event 
book
, which is also held for sale, and then very little against the other two 
portfolios. But, it was really the relationship portfolio or the corporate 
portfolio that you see on page 
--
 
a part of that portfolio that you see in the 
supplement.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And th
en, just a separate question. James, good to have you back, so I can 
--
 
glad to see you healthy and so I can also ask you questions on the call. 
But, as someone who's had COVID now, how do you frame the debate 
between saving lives and saving jobs and the e
conomy? I mean, what are 
you advising your clients to do? I mean, how do you think the economy 
could come back on line? And again, I'm glad you're back with us.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, thanks, Mike. I appreciate that. And I'm one of the fortunate people to 
have
 
had it without having a need to be hospitalized or be in any serious 
health danger to my lungs. So, I'm very grateful for that. Unfortunately, 
there are many, many thousands of people now who do not have that kind 
of outcome. And for them, my heart goes o
ut to them. I don't think it gives 
me any special expertise having been through this. What I think is 
--
 
we'll 
obviously be guided by the CDC and the state and federal authorities. My 
assumption is, the right way to do this is to have a staggered people go
ing 
back to work and to do it either by region or maybe by industry in part. But, 
I think separate companies or deciding what to do on their own is a bad 

day people are hitting
 
back at June 1st, then some are on June 1st, some 
June 15th, et cetera through the summer. So, sort of a staggered approach. 
There are clearly a lot of people who've had the virus who are now 
apparently not infectious, including myself. And there are a lo
t of young 
folks who do not appear particularly vulnerable to this virus. So, that's 
probably where you'd start, if you're 
--
 
I'm not a health expert. I'll leave that 
in the hands of the health experts.
 
At Morgan Stanley, my hope is we'd be able to test pe
ople to make sure that 
they're healthy and clean and we bring people back in the staggered way as 
soon as the government lets us do that. We currently have 10% of our 
employees still at work. We'll be I'm sure rotating employees through the 
rest of the yea
r. Everybody's got used to working home as I am sure you 

complete answer, but I'm not really an expert, so.
 
Mike Mayo
 
All right. I guess, we're all wondering when you can test people
 
and decide if 
they're clean. And I'd say, we're all in the same boat, but you're in a better 
position to rely on the experts, and again, advising all the corporations 
around the world or so many of them. Any 
--
 
what's your best guess at that?
 
James Gorman
 
Of when people can be tested?
 
Mike Mayo
 
Yes. I mean, everybody's doing studies. And I know it's a very difficult 
question. But, CEOs need to make decisions about resource allocations, et 
cetera. So, what are you telling CEOs that you advise?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. But, I'm not advising them on when the various testing for antibodies is 
going to be coming through. I mean, that's 
--
 
we're really in the hands of 
the government. And I think, we're all getting the same information. I was 
on the President's task forc
e call of CEOs and I'm getting the information 
from the White House, and they're getting it from the health authorities and 
the various pharmaceutical companies. I know there's been a lot of work 
done, Abbott Labs has done 
--
 
Abbott has done some work. The
y're 
developing some testing. And obviously in other parts of the world, they've 
got faster testing for anybody. So, I just hope we get it to the U.S. And it's 
rapidly deployed, which I think is what everybody's working on right now.
 
So, Mike, I'm sorry, I
'm just not 
--
 
I can't. I don't advise CEOs on when the 
testing framework is going to happen.
 
Guys, we're going to take just one more question I think, because we're 
running 
--
 
we've run over time and we've given you long answers. Hopefully 
they've been he
lpful to those who haven't had a chance to ask a question. I 
apologize for that. But, it's a fairly dense earnings call as you all appreciate. 
And we're here as follow
-
ups and through Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor 
Relations, obviously John and myself in
 
the days and weeks ahead.
 
So, we'll take one more question, operator.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your 
line is now open.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Thank you. Jon, can you share with us, I think, you've mentioned that 
co
ming out at the end of the quarter in Wealth Management, 23% of your 
customers assets were in cash. How does that compare to the start of the 
year? And what how do you see them bringing that down over the 
subsequent months or quarters?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
That's a 
great question in terms of how our retail clients are going to 
reengage with the market. So, let me just give you just some facts. The 
23% is cash or cash equivalents including money markets and short term 
fixed income securities. That number is probably u
p 3 to 4 points in the last 
quarter or two. And if you look at the totality of the money, the $2.4 trillion, 

the 3 to 4 points is gone into this cash and short
-
term securities.
 
How l
ong people feel the need to stay in short term and cash? I think, it's 
going to be a function of what some of the things that we've been talking 
about on this call, which is people's perspective, when the economy opens 
up again or the work from home ceases
 
and some of the restaurants and 
businesses get back into business and people feel more comfortable with the 
outlook. And that's why we're also not fully deploying those deposits 
because again they are generally very sticky. But they're also based on the 
i
nvestment decisions of our clients. So, we're going to see, monitor those to 
make sure that we feel comfortable deploying this.

James Gorman
 
Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Kathleen. As we begin another year, 
I'd like to share my 
thoughts on the current state of Morgan Stanley, discuss 
our progress against last year's priorities and share our plans for 2015. 
During my comments, I'll be referencing a presentation that you can find on 
the Investor Relations section of our website.
 
Fo
r the past five years this management team has worked hard to the 
following. One, to put the trouble for the financial crisis clearly in the rear 
review mirror. Two, to reposition our firm to benefit from our world class and 
complimentary franchises in Ins
titutional Securities, Wealth Management 
and Investment Management as shown on slide 3. And finally to lay out 
specific plans with clear signposts for investors to follow as we work towards 
sustained, higher returns. Each year we like to remind you of the 
key 
elements of the plan, mark those elements to market and refresh the plan 
for the coming year so investors can properly judge our absolute and 
relative performance.
 
Before I make my strategic comments, let me briefly touch on the quarter. 
Our final resu
lt this year reflect a number of idiosyncratic issues including 
tax benefits, compensation changes, FBA implementation and legal reserves. 
In addition, the quarter reflects a difficult market in trading environment 
across the industry especially in October
 
and the last few weeks of 
December. Our trading businesses in particular fixed income and commodity 
sales and trading were clearly not immune to the unfavorable market 
environment. While Q4 had several complicating elements, it was also an 
important quart
er as we continue to put residual issues from the financial 
crisis behind us. In a few minutes, Ruth will take you through the quarter in 
much more detail.
 
Before doing so, let me begin with the mark
-
to
-
market for 2014 which you 
can now see on slide 4. 201
4 was a year focused execution against the 
strategic plan we have previously articulated. In Wealth Management, we 
continue to improve our profit margin and are well on the way to delivering 
22% to 25% margin by the end of 2015. Fixed income and commoditie
s, we 
continue to resize and reshape the business and doing more to drive ROE. 
We continue to improve our expense ratios. We made strong progress in 
Morgan Stanley 
-
specific growth opportunities most notably growth in the 
banks. We increased our share buyb
ack and for the first time in several 
years, we increased our dividend. As a result of these collective actions, 
we've made progress towards returns that meet and exceed our cost of 
capital.
 
With that, let me turn to the six areas of strategic focus for 20
15. First, 
Wealth Management which is on slide 6. For full year 2014, we delivered a 
20% margin on wealth management, up 200 basis points versus 2013 and 
we have a clear path for achieving our goal of 22% to 25% by the end of 
this year. After taking into a
ccount the adjustment to our compensation 
deferral, the pretax margin improved through the year. Our fourth quarter 
2015 target is driven by the revenue and operating leverage from deposit 
deployment and the ongoing benefits of scale. It is important to no
te that 
this target does not take into account the benefit of eventual higher interest 
rates and stronger equity market levels. The target also does not include the 
benefit of the positive secular trend towards fee based managed account. 
This trend plays t
o the strength of our advisory based model and generally 
translates into more stable revenues and deeper client relationships, a trend 
we've discussed with you in the past.
 
There are several additional drivers of upside for wealth management as 
we've outli
ned on slide 7. We continue to grow our assets under 
management and ended the year with over $2 trillion of client asset 
benefiting in particular from our focus on the high net worth and ultra
-
high 
net worth client segments. Since 2009, we've grown assets 
in the $10 
million and above household by 82%, and assets in the $1 million to $10 
million segment by 35%. Our model based on providing high valued advice, 
helps position us to meet the broad and complex financial planning and 
investment needs of these cli
ents.
 
We have further upside as we attract more of our clients' deposit that go 
consistent with our growing bank presence. Given the magnitude of the 
client base, even a modest increase in our share of client deposits hold 
significant upside for us. Greg F
leming will share more of this opportunity 
with you later this year.
 
Second is our bank strategy. On page 8, we described to you the 
components of revenue growth in our banks. We continue to benefit from 
the three tailwinds; one, growth in the deposit base
 
and associated assets. 
Two, the optimization of those assets namely moving cash into [AFS] [ph] 
and lending, and three eventual upside from higher rates. We see strong 
loan demand among our sizable wealth management and institutional 
securities client bas
e. With no bricks
-
and
-
mortar and embedded client base 
and a required infrastructure investment behind us, the incremental margin 
on lending product is exceptionally high. As a result of our ongoing progress 
in the bank, we are providing you with updated ta
rgets for 2015 as well as 
growth to $180 billion in assets by year
-
end 2016, up from $151 billion as of 
year
-
end 2014.
 
Based on current market rates and our expected asset mix at the end of 
2016, the blended yield would be 2%. If we substitute the yield in
dicated by 
the forward curve on the same asset base, the blended yield would be 3.1%.
 
Turn now please to Slide 9. In our Institutional Securities business, our 
leadership in advisory and equity sales and trading continues to provide 
further stability along
 
with upside. In advisory, we finished second in global 
completed and announced M&A. We've continued strength in large cap cross 
border M&A activity, we believe our global footprint and leadership across 
products and geographies, positions us well to benef
it from current trends. 
In equity sales and trading, we build on the momentum of recent years. 
With full year revenues of $6.9 billion ex
-
DVA placing us first among US 
peers and we expect first globally. Our success in 2014 reflects high quality 
execution 
and share gains.
 
This brings us to our third area of strategic focus, Fixed Income and 
Commodities as seen on slide 10. Against the challenging backdrop, we 
made some progress on our plan to drive for return exceeding our cost of 
equity. Within fixed incom
e, we reduced balance sheet, risk weighted assets 
and non
-
compensation expenses. We also maintained normalized ROEs of 
greater than 10% in our areas of strength namely securitized products and 
credit corporates. Furthermore, we continued to optimize return
s in rates 
and roll down structured credit RWAs. Within commodities, we reduced our 
exposure to physical oil, most notably by selling TransMontaigne and we 
remained committed to selling our oil merchanting business. We are also 
integrating the balance of o
ur commodities business within sales and 
trading.
 
From a capital perspective, we remain on track to reduce fixed income and 
commodities RWAs to $180 billion target by yearend 2015, down from $390 
billion in 2011. Furthermore, as you can see on slide 11, we
 
will have an 
additional $25 billion of dead weight risk weighted assets that will roll down 
by the end of 2018 providing incremental ROE upside.
 
Assuming we find the right opportunities, we will utilize the associated 
capital to maximize return across the
 
franchise either within fixed income or 
in other areas where client demand is consistent with the highest return 
opportunities.
 
Number four. Next area where we see upside is the benefit from lower 
funding costs shown in some detail on slide 12. As the mar
ket is recognized 
improvements our business makes and balance sheet, our spreads have 
contracted dramatically. More so than those of our peers. This reduces our 
funding costs, as we finance older more expensive debt. This should result in 
meaningful reduct
ion in our weighted average cost of unsecured funding on 
both an absolute and relative basis over the next several years providing us 
with a further tailwind.
 
Last year we issued new debt and an average spread of 100 basis points 
over three months LIBOR an
d improvement of 200 basis points since 2012. 
From peak to trough our average funding cost is expected to decline by 
approximately 25%. Fifth is our ongoing focus on expenses as shown on 
slide 13. The changes to the compensation structure announced in the 
fourth 
quarter reduced the overhang of prior year deferrals and decrease the 
portion of current new compensation deferred into future years which was 
the prudent thing to do. The result is a reduced liability in a muted 
environment and greater operating le
verage in an improved revenue 
environment.
 
With these changes, we've decreased our target compensation net revenue 
ratio in our institutional securities business to 39% or less in 2015 and 
beyond. Notably, this guidance assumes a flat revenue environment. 
In a 
better revenue environment, the compensation ratio could go even lower. In 
addition, we reaffirmed that we are working towards the compensation ratio 
of 55% or lower in wealth management and 40% or lower in investment 
management.
 
We also remain focuse
d on non
-
compensation expenses and achieved a 29% 
non
-
compensation efficiency ratio in 2014 excluding obviously the elevated 
legal expenses versus 2012 levels. With the changes to our compensation 
structure and our disciplined on non
-
compensation expenses,
 
we remained 
on track to deliver an overall expense ratio excluding elevated legal of 79% 
or lower in 2015.
 
Six is the return of capital to our shareholders. We've repeatedly 
emphasized our commitment to prudently increase our capital returns over 
time sub
ject to regulatory approval. Our plan is to increase both our share 
buyback program and our dividend with greater returns of capital supported 
by the increased proportion of our revenue and earnings coming from more 
stable businesses. As you can see on sli
de 14, since 2012 we've grown our 
total payout ratio from 13% to 30%. While also investing in our business 
through the completion of the wealth management JV. Critically, during that 
same period we've grown our capital base by 12%.
 
The key drivers of incre
ased return to shareholders over time our consistent 
earnings, a strong capital ratios and a strategy that is consistent with 
evolving regulatory requirements.
 
Finally, let me address returns. Our focus remains on generating high 
returns for shareholders b
y improving our ROE to sustainable level that 
exceed our cost of equity independent of market conditions. We see a clear 
path to an ROE of 10% based on the levels we've just described you, all of 
which are within our control.
 
To summarize, this includes ac
hieving our wealth management margin 
target, executing on our bank strategy, completing our exit from a physical 
oil business, progress on our optimization and fixed income, continued focus 
on disciplined expense management and continued CCAR capital appro
val. 
We also see higher than 10% returns with an improved rate environment, 
improved global economic growth which in turn drives our wealth 
management and institutional securities business performance. And higher 
payout ratios reflecting higher capital ret
urns.
 
Now that we finished the broader, strategic discussion, let me return to Ruth 
who walk through the details of the fourth quarter performance and way we 
finished 2014.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the
 
effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the 
earnings release to reconcile these non
-
GAAP measures. Results for the 
fourth quarter include several significant items which complicate 
comparisons to prior period. They include a ne
t discrete tax benefit of $1.4 
billion or $0.77 per diluted share principally related to the restructuring of a 
legal entity. Compensation expense adjustments of approximately $1.1 
billion or $0.40 per diluted share related to changes in discretionary 
ince
ntive compensation deferrals. A pretax charge of $468 million reflected 
as negative revenue or a loss of $0.17 per diluted share related to the initial 
incorporation of funding valuation adjustments, FVA into the fair value 
measurements for certain over
-
th
e
-
counter derivatives and legal expenses 
of $284 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share associated with several 
legacy residential mortgage related matters. In addition, the impact of DVA 
in the quarter was positive $223 million with $161 million in 
fixed income 
sales and trading and $62 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the 
impact of DVA, reflecting the impact of $468 million related to FVA, firm
-
wide revenues were $7.5 billion, down 13% versus the third quarter. And 
earnings from contin
uing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders excluding DVA were $783 million. Earnings from continuing 
operation per diluted share excluding DVA were $0.40 after preferred 
dividend. Earnings from continuing operation include the impact 
of the 
previously mentioned funding valuation adjustment, net discrete tax benefit, 
and compensation expense deferral adjustment and legacy residential 
mortgage related matters in the quarter. On a GAAP basis including the 
impact of DVA firm
-
wide revenues 
for the quarter were $7.8 billion. Earnings 
from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common 
shareholders were $928 million. Reported earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share were $0.47 after preferred dividends. Book 
value at th
e end of the quarter was $34.62 per share and tangible book 
value was $29.63 per share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $808 billion at December 31, 
down from $815 billion at the end of the third quarter. Deposits as of 
quarter end were 
$134 billion, up $9 billion versus Q3, reflecting the on 
boarding of deposits from city and typical seasonal increases in client cash. 
Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $193 billion compared 
with $190 billion at the end of the third quart
er.
 
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that 
our common equity Tier
-
1 transitional ratio will be approximately 14.2% and 
our Tier
-
1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 15.9%.
 
Basel III transitional risk
-
weighted assets are expected to be approximately 
$423 billion at December 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final set of 
reserve rules our pro forma common equity Tier
-
1 ratio using the Basel III 
fully
-
phased in advanced approach was 12.4% at Decemb
er 31, down from 
12.7% in the third quarter.
 
Our pro forma standardized ratio was 11.7%, flat to the third quarter. Pro 
forma fully
-
phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be 
approximately $432 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary 
lev
erage ratio under the U.S. final rule to be approximately 5% at December 
31, up from 4.9% at the end of 3Q, 2014. These estimates are preliminary 
and are subject to revision.
 
Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $7.9 billion, up 
versus
 
the third quarter reflecting the significant items I noted at the outset. 
Compensation expense was $5.1 billion in the quarter driven primarily by 
the change in compensation structure. Specifically the quarter include an 
expense of $1.1 billion representi
ng $756 million related to the reduction in 
the average deferral of discretionary incentive compensation award for the 
2014 performance year and $381 million for the acceleration of investing for 
certain outstanding deferred cash based incentive compensati
on award. This 
provides us with operating leverage in the upside and reduces liability in the 
down side as best evidenced by the reduced compensation ratio target for 
2015 and beyond the James noted.
 
Non
-
compensation expense was $2.8billion for the quarter
, up 13% quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by increase legal expense. Let me now discuss our 
businesses in detail.
 
In institutional securities revenues, excluding DVA, were $3.2 billion, down 
25% sequentially and include a pretax charge of $468 million related t
o the 
initial incorporation of funding valuation adjustment. Revenues excluding the 
impact of FVA and DVA were $3.7 billion, down 15% sequentially.
 
Non
-
interest expense was $4.3 billion, up versus the third quarter. 
Compensation expense was $2.4 billion fo
r the fourth quarter, up 37% 
versus the third quarter driven by the previously mentioned compensation 
expense deferral adjustment.
 
Non
-
compensation expense for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, up 23% 
versus the third quarter driven by increased legal e
xpenses. Including the 
impact of DVA and FVA, revenues were $3.4 billion.
 
In investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 3% versus last 
quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number 1 in 
global IPOs and number 2 in global an
nounced and completed M&A and 
global equity at the end of the fourth quarter. Notable transactions included 
in advisory, Morgan Stanley continued its leadership position in cross border 
and large transaction including as lead financial advisor to Cubist 
Ph
armaceutical and its announced $9.5 billion sales to Merck.
 
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley a sole book runner completed a $4.7 
billion H 
-
 
share follow on offering on behalf of China based insurer, Ping An 
Insurance Group.
 
In debt underwriting, Mor
gan Stanley acted as Lead Left book runner on 
Alibaba's $8 billion inaugural senior notes offering. This was landmark deal, 
the third largest debt IPO globally and largest bond transaction for an Asian 
issuer ever.
 
Advisory revenues of $488 million increas
ed 24% versus our third quarter 
results driven by increased revenues in EMEA and the Americas.
 
Underwriting revenues of $807 million decreased 15% versus our third 
quarter results driven by equity underwriting revenues of $345 million, down 
26% versus the 
third quarter, reflecting lower volumes in Asia and the 
Americas.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $462 million, down 5% versus the 
third quarter primarily due to decrease in investment grade loans, partly 
offset by increased issuance in both investme
nt grade and high yield bond. 
Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA were over $1.6 billion, 
down 9% compared to last quarter. Cash equity and derivative revenues 
were down sequentially due to more challenging market environment. 
Revenues in prim
e brokerage were flat versus the third quarter.
 
Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA 
were $133 million, down significantly versus the third quarter, primarily 
reflecting a pretax charge of $466 million related to the initial
 
incorporation 
of FVA into the fair value measurement of certain over the counter 
derivative. Revenues excluding DVA and the pretax charge related to FVA 
were $599 million for the quarter. Commodities revenues were challenged in 
the quarter due primarily t
o the decline in oil prices. Credit revenues in the 
quarter were down versus the third quarter driven by a difficult market 
environment. Average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was $47million, up 
from $42 million in the third quarter.
 
Turning to wealth 
management. Revenues were $3.8 billion in the fourth 
quarter, up 1% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.1 billion 
were flat to the last quarter.
 
Transaction revenues were up 7% compared to last quarter, consisting 
primarily of commissions of $573
 
million, up 14% to the prior quarter, 
driven by a pickup across most products. Investment banking related fees of 
$173 million, down 23% versus last quarter, primarily reflecting lower 
activity in closed end funds and trading revenues of $230 million, up 
24% 
versus the third quarter, reflecting higher revenues from deferred 
compensation plans.
 
Net interest revenue increased 4% to $625 million, driven primarily by 
higher revenues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our 
lending product. Oth
er revenue of $67 million decreased 40% versus the 
third quarter primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of a retail 
property space we discussed in the third quarter. Non
-
interest expense was 
$3.1 billion, up 3% versus last quarter. Non
-
compensati
on expense was 
$777 million, down from last quarter.
 
Compensation expense was $2.3 billion, up versus the third quarter, 
primarily due to the compensation expense adjustments related to changes 
in discretionary incentive compensation deferral previously me
ntioned. The 
compensation ratio was 60% up versus the third quarter, reflecting the 
change in compensation structure.
 
The PBT margin was 19% which similarly reflects the impact of the change 
in compensation structure.
 
Profit before tax was $736 million. To
tal client assets exceeded $2 trillion, 
global fee based asset inflows were $20.8 billion, fee
-
based assets under 
management increased to $785 billion at quarter end, representing 39% of 
client assets. Global representatives were 16,076, essentially flat t
o the third 
quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $137 billion, up $8 
billion versus the third quarter. Approximately $128 billion were held in 
Morgan Stanley Bank.
 
Wealth Management lending balances continued to grow reflecting the 
ongoing ex
ecution of our bank strategy. Investment Management revenues 
of $588 million were down 12% sequentially. In traditional asset 
management revenues of $432 million were down 8% versus the third 
quarter, driven in part by lower market level.
 
In real estate in
vesting, revenues of $103 million were down compared with 
the third quarter. Merchant banking revenues were $53 million down 38% 
driven by the absence of investment gains versus the third quarter. Non
-
interest expenses were $594 million, up 25% from the th
ird quarter 
including compensation expense of $381 million reflecting a compensation 
deferral adjustment mentioned previously.
 
Non
-
compensation expense was $213 million, down 4% from the third 
quarter. Profit before tax was loss of $6 million in the fourth
 
quarter. NCI 
was $12 million versus $18 million last quarter. And total assets under 
management increased to $403 million driven by higher flows, primarily 
offset by market depreciation.
 
Finally, our outlook is consistent with data that suggest ongoing gr
owth in 
the U.S. and the expectation the key market outside the U.S. will benefit 
from central bank support. Both should benefit client activity level 
particularly in the sales and trading businesses. In investment banking, the 
M&A pipeline is up, driven b
y continued strength in large and cross border 
M&A where we are well positioned given our global franchise. The global 
equity underwriting pipeline remains similarly healthy, benefiting from broad 
base global activity. The pipeline also includes traditiona
l issuance from 
transaction that was deferred to the first half of 2015 during the market 
choppiness of October.
 
In Wealth Management, which is overwhelmingly U.S. driven, our outlook is 
also positive. Our margin target indicates upside in the business and
 
underscores confidence about the state of, and growing contribution from 
the execution of our bank strategy. As James noted, lower funding cost 
continue to provide upside in revenues for our sales and trading business.
 
Regarding the regulatory environment
. Through all the actions we've taken 
in the last five years, we are well positioned to deal with the requirement we 
face. With the strong capital and liquidity ratios we've built, we have great 
flexibility to deliver for clients and stakeholder.
 
Thank you for listening. James and I will now take your questions.

[Operator Instructions]
 
Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please 
go ahead with your question.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morn
ing. Quick question on the outlook and the strategic update which 
is much appreciated. The potential to take FIC RWAs to $155 billion based 
on the passive roll down, what sort of time line should we use to think about 
that?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the target is as w
e indicated is $180 billion by yearend 2015. And that 
includes the additional $25 billion of run off over time. That additional $25 
billion will run off through 2018. So that would take it to the $155 billion 
unless of course we find opportunities to reinv
est within fixed income as 
James said. So that's over 2018.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Got it. Thank you. If you guys find that FIC returns sort of remain at current 
levels, we kind of get this current environment proves to be a bit more of 
the steady state rather tha
n what many of us are hoping is a cyclical weak 
point, how low can that number go beyond that if you find that you need to 
allocate more money over to the equities and the wealth management from 
a capital perspective?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, we have ample capital
 
and so we are supporting the client demand and 
activity in the equities business and don't want to leave you with that the 
final comment you made which is to 
--
 
is it a trade off between the two. So 
again very importantly given the strong capital position
s in and given the 
strength and importance of the equity business two or three of ample capital 
to support client activity there and are 
--
 
as it relates to fixed income, our 
approach has been as we've said repeatedly to be very clinical about capital 
bala
nce sheet expenses and that was the main point that we made here this 
morning. We've reduced each of those in 2014 and we remain very focused 
on how to drive returns in the business. So being very diligent on that.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay, all right. Thanks fo
r that. On FIC, there was a change leadership in 
the commodities business. Is that indicative of a new direction for that 
business? And then also as we think about the commodities business, is it 
possible that the overall business there has been impacted b
y the sort of 
drawn out sale process to the physical business?
 
James Gorman
 
Brennan, I think we put in place the commodity strategy couple of years ago 
which was completely independent of the regulatory environment we are in 
which was essentially we did no
t want to be a significant player in physical 
businesses. The largest physical space we had was in oil. And we completed 
the TransMontaigne deal and we are well underway to complete the rest of 
the sale when obviously ran into other issues requiring govern
ment 
approval. So we are still on that track. So the management changes were 
completely independent of that. These are big businesses. We management 
evolve and company of this size periodically. So I wouldn't read great deal 
into that. We are well on track
 
with commodities. So with where we wanted 
to be. Did it affect the performance the business; the fact ran the sale 
process. I can't really say whether it did or didn't. Certainly, I wouldn't say 
materially, I think much more material was actually going on
 
in the oil 
market in the last several months. We didn't have a good fourth quarter in 
commodities. It happens almost, probably almost volatile business segment. 
I don't expect that to be a permanent state.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. Thanks for all that color. A
nd then last on capital markets. You guys 
highlighted lower revenues in derivatives and cash. Was there anything 
episodic impacting those businesses? Because we heard some of the 
competitors highlight some strength in some of those businesses especially 
ca
sh recently.
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. I would say that overall our client franchise remains strong and so we 
are continuing to see levels of activity. Cash tends to be seasonal as you 
wind up the year. So, no, I wouldn't call out anything particular, choppier 
market
s are more challenging for derivative.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Sure, sure, okay. That's helpful. And then deferred comp, I think you guys 
weighted out, I know that it can sometimes impact both the revenue and 
expense line in wealth management, changes in the deferr
ed comp. Did we 
-
-
 
can you quantify that for us and did that impact the pretax margin in 
wealth management this quarter aside from the noise that was going in the 
change in deferrals?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. You just said it, the key point in the margin was really 
the change in this 
structure of compensation, usually PBT margin neutral and so, no, it didn't 
--
 
the main point was the change in structure.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. 
Please go ahead with your quest
ion.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Thanks. So you noted the legal on the quarter. I am curious if you had 
handy the all in legal cost for the year? And if it is right for us because I am 
thinking about lot less next year given that mortgage put to bed, LIBOR 
setting 
bank and obviously had limited FX business?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the full year a legal related expenses for 2014 were around $600 million.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
And you think I am crazy if I am thinking for next year?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, the point we take consistently is it 
litigation from the crisis and 
resolved that remains headwind, I appreciate the question. It is tough to 
forecast neither timing or announces is fully in our control. So appreciate the 
question but that's about all I think.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
So I like to slide 
on the lower funding cost and I think lots of are benefiting, 
you are benefiting maybe little more than most, can you put that in a dollar 
term for us, in terms of what means for next year, the year after. I 
understand that it is fallen and it is pretty dy
namic conversation. I am just 
curious if its dollar.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, we realized the benefit over time given the weighted average maturity 
of unsecured stack is about six years. So as we refinance out of that, well 
leg into at over time, at this point we 
are refinancing some of that we issue 
both crisis and that's why wanted to give the trajectory and overall the trend 
line.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
All right. Two other clean up. So one the clean comp ratio for 2014 for ISG is 
a lot of ex all the FVA, DVA and comp cha
rges?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Right. So full year again excluding all of those is full year about a point.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Around to 
--
 
is it 40, 41?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, full year 41 down from 42 after.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Got it. Okay and then last one on deposit front. The fee bas
ed flows were 
huge for any quarter, fourth quarter; I don't remember being usually a big 
quarter for it. Usually think of that is more as beginning of the year if there 
was any seasonality to at all. The question is, has anything change on 
incentive wise o
r no product wise or is it just the continuation of the 
process?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. We had strong flows during the fourth quarter and the full year. There 
can be some lumpiness as we talked about last quarter but continued 
strength in it as you appropriately s
aid it is kind of 
--
 
you look at a full year 
and it is very strong and underscores the point that James made which is 
that there is a strong secular trend here and we benefit from given the scale 
of the business we have and the breadth of products content 
and service we 
are providing.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with 
Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning. Just trying to read into the ROE chart at the end of the 
strategic presentatio
n. Last year the base line was 9%, this year the base 
line number you built of is 10%. Is it really just that the 10% base line now 
includes higher confidence on capital actions. Is that the main difference or 
should we be saying that there is material und
erline increase when all the 
puts and takes are taken into account?
 
Ruth Porat
 
I am glad you pointed out because we do think it's important. There are 
number of items that are reflected in that. I would say the change in 
compensation structure is the 
contributor as well and so James laid out the 
various items. And as you know this is without the benefit from a rising rate 
environment. So it is what we see the upside wealth management and the 
bank is incorporating revenue benefit from the lower funding 
costs, we are 
continuing to make progress in fixed income. Although we are doing on the 
expense side as I said that compensation structure change is important and 
did allow us to reduce the comp ratio in ISG to 39% or lower, that's in flat 
revenue environm
ent. So better revenues, we have even further operating 
leverage but that's an important point. And all the stuffs we've taken over 
the last several years. The expectations about continued increases and 
return to capital. So we've made some tough choices, 
appreciate a 
complicated some of the comments this morning but made these tough 
choices that did have a negative impact on the quarter but sets us up well 
and that's we put it in here as we are modeling a 10%.
 
James Gorman
 
I would just add, Guy, what we've
 
always try to do is when we have clarity 
of vision on something is too laid out there for our shareholders. And we 
have much more clarity of vision around the 10% frankly. As Ruth said 
because of all the things that we have checked off and some of the thi
ngs 
we've put behind is in the change in the comp and where we have capital, 
much more clarity of vision. So when we see something that we think is 
clearly achievable that's what we are going to put out for shareholders and 
we have also identified that the
re is obviously upside. It is depended on 
something which are less within our control but not unreasonable to expect 
at some point in the future.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
And is that additional upside about the same as it was last year? Obviously 
all we have is hope
fully proportional hunk of a bar chart to compare it 
against but it appears that's largely unchanged?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. I wouldn't draw too much into our graphic skills and ratios of bar sizes. 
No, I think we are saying, we clearly see an improved rate env
ironment. We 
are in a business mix that we think does well with the improving global 
economy and we are over
-
weighted to the U.S. because of wealth 
management which is we all know is doing best among the developed 
countries on risk adjusted return basis. A
nd we clearly see additional capital 

 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Got it. And just as a follow up on the capital ratios. Thank you, Ruth, for the 
fully phased figures on both advanced and stan
dardized, why did the 
advanced come down a little bit?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as you know we are governed by standardized, as flat under 
standardized, and the RWAs under the advanced approaches were up for a 
couple of reasons, primarily due to volatility but also l
ending growth and ops 
risk goes in there. So those are up; it was really RWA is up.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Got it. On the oil business which as you pointed out ran into a roadblock 
because of the Russian situation in terms of trying of sell it, what's the 
outlook 
there and if it is not sold, would you look to wind that business down 
and over what timeframe?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So we do remain focused on selling it as a business and we'll let you know 
when we have something to say on that.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, I mean we are cle
arly intent on getting out of the physical oil business. 
We made that very clear. We had a contract for sale. We couldn't complete 
for reasons outside of our control. And we will get out of the physical oil 
business.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
And I guess the question
 
was really around if it's harder to sell in the current 
environment and you need to wind down elements of it, what kind of 
timeframe should we be thinking about?
 
Ruth Porat
 
We actually don't see if the question is really with lower oil and that affect 
the
 
sale of the business. We don't see it negatively affecting the sale. We 
have excess storage capacity so that actually sets the business up well to 
benefit from rising oil prices and we think capacity at these levels and 
benefiting as oil prices rise. So i
t doesn't affect the sale process.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Okay. That's helpful color. On the FIC target just with run off down to the 
155 and this is maybe a subtle change in what you are communicating but I 
want to make sure I understand it. I think you had said 
previously that as 
you got down to the 155 

 
160 level from the run off you would look to 
redeploy within FIC to the 180 level. But now it sounds like you are leaving 
the options open to redeploy more broadly across the business. Is that 
right? And if so, 
what drives the thinking?
 
Ruth Porat
 
That is correct. And what we are saying is look there have been structural 
headwinds in the industry, there have been some cyclical ones as well. We 
have a clear plan that includes the reduction in balance sheet capital
 
and 
expenses that we've talked about. And we just wanted 
--
 
we are being 
--
 
what we are saying is we're being very clinical here which is we are 
targeting 180, there is another 25 that comes off and the right prudent thing 
to do as custodians of the busin
ess is to ensure we put that incremental 
capital capacity to support the highest return businesses across highest 
return products and if that's within fixed income where we've already some 
products that are generating attractive return such as in corporate
 
credit and 
securitized product. And there is client demand for incremental capital that's 
an opportunity but we will look across the franchise. So you are right. I am 
glad you drew that it out; it is change we just want to make it very clear 
how we are ap
proaching it.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good, well, I think your shareholders probably appreciate that, that 
flexibility so that's good to understand. In terms of the reduction in the ISG 
comp target. Is all of that reduction to 39% or less due to the change in 
the 
deferral strategy or is there actually a view that in the current environment 
you can reduce the comp payout?
 
Ruth Porat
 
It is due to the change in the comp structure. It was an important step for 
us to take; it gives us as I said reduced 
liability on the downside importantly 
operating leverage in the upside but by pulling forward future deferral and 
changing the deferral rate it enabled us to set that compensation ratio at 
39% in a flat rate, flat revenue environment. It was operating leve
rage, a 
lower comp ratio and a better revenue environment and we think 
underscores importance of that change.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Cool. And then just one final one for me on the legal cost this quarter. Was 
that essentially a litigation reserved build because o
f things for which you 
had estimable and probable or was it actually a clean
-
up of current quarter 
expenses? And, if so, can you give us a little color on what they were?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. Reserves as you just said are based and estimated each quarter based

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo 
with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi. I was looking for more color on slide 15 with the ROE target. And does 
this
 
imply that going from 9% to 10% that if you have capital action so 
could be 11% and on tangible basis it could be 12%? Again I am just 
comparing this year slide 15 with last year's slide 15. And related to that you 
talked about having a greater clarity of
 
vision but this also comes in a 
quarter where you missed consensus expectations. So is this quarter a one
-
off in your mind or how do you think about all that?
 
James Gorman
 
Firstly the 9% to 10% reflects all of the things that are implied under the 
--
 
or l
isted on the left hand side of that page, Mike. It also talks about as last 
of those receiving non objection on our CCAR capital request. And what we 
pointed out is that obviously in future, yes, we see future upside as we make 
additional capital returns a
s we are reshaping the balance sheet and 
reshaping the businesses. So it's 
--
 
when we talk about clarity of vision, we 
are one year closer. We are seeing real progress in the wealth management 
business with a margin improvement of 200 basis points. We expe
ct 
progress to continue. This is why we set goals which are currently above 
where we are performing. We see real opportunity in the lower funding cost. 
It is clear that our bank strategy is being well executed in building the asset 
side of the balance shee

cetera, et cetera. So we felt it was important to lay out for our shareholders.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And the timeframe for this target?
 
James Gorman
 
Obviously, we haven't given timeframe on these targets because we
 
can't 
control the market environment around us.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Okay. Well, some more specifics related to this. In terms of higher interest 
rate slide 6, you talk about the margin improvement and you said your 22% 
to 25% wealth management pretax margin does no
t rely on higher interest 
rate. Can you describe your interest rate sensitivity if rate did increase 100 
or 50 basis points?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So you are actually right, this does not include benefit of higher rate. You 
can somewhat say the benefit rate through t
he roll forward that we have on 
the bank side. We frequently discussed there are a real positive for us, the 
factors to consider in that as you are modeling it out is we do generate 
higher net interest income even in the flat rate environment because we ar
e 
still in relatively early stages of deposit deployment. I think that's quite 
differentiated but rising rate environment just a component, again it does 
drop meaningfully to the bottom line because of the cost structure, the bank 
and James said, we've alr
eady invested in the infrastructure required. We 
don't have bricks and mortar; FAs are not paid on the grid. All the things 
that we've talked about with you before. And then what we did as we 
provided yields and assets mix to help you model the NII upside 
and we 
actually extended out the estimate of asset growth to 2016 on that slide. 
Previously we had out to 2015; it builds on the strength of the performance 
in 2014. In fact, we ended prior to our estimate for 2014. And I think the 
other couple of elements
 
in it but just no update on that. So given deposit 
here are different from retail bank. They are very sticky given the nature of 
deposit and more like working capital. We continue to assume about our 45 
basis point increase in deposit pricing with the fir
st 100 basis point increase 
in rate. We do believe that model is conservative given the nature of our 
deposits and structural changes and deposit alternative. Those funds 
--
 
it 
continues to be more relevant rate for our business than the average ratio of 
b
ank asset is around year and half. So again rising rates benefit as quickly 
but the point on this on the bank side really was to extended out so that you 
can model in the benefit as you see
--
 
as you escalate rising rate.
 
Mike Mayo
 
What is your efficiency r
atio for the bank since you are talking about that 
your expense to revenue ratio? Because you highlighted the fact that you 
don't have bricks and mortars so I assume the efficiency ratio would be 
better than the typical bank?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. We don't rate 
that out separately, but you are absolutely right which 
why we said it drops meaningfully to the bottom line.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. I mean it's obviously better because the whole strategy around the 
bank is driving more throughputs through an existing branch s
tructure.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And then lastly you highlighted compensation so did I hear you correctly 
that the compensation expense should decline from 41% on a core basis in 
2014 to 39% or less in 2015? Is that correct?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. Correct. In a flat 
revenue environment, yes.
 
Mike Mayo
 
And James you have been very vocal in the past and I guess in hindsight 
giving a lot of stock to people at much lower stock prices worked, but can 
you talk about the trade
-
off between paying your people and then meeting 
Wall Street expectation? In other words getting the desired earnings growth. 
There is talk about people from brokered firms going elsewhere such as 
private equity. So how do you manage that trade
-
off?
 
James Gorman
 
Well, firstly, Mike, I am delighted for al
l of our shareholders if the stock is 
appreciated, 26% I think last year, 60 something percent years before and 
25% year before that including our employees who frankly deserve that. 
They are the ones who rode the boat. They got the job done and they 
deser
ved it. So I have no qualms about the employees benefiting from the 
rising stock. And listen, it is a balance. What we did coming at the crisis was 
we deferred up to a 100% our employees' bonuses, we did that for a very 
specific reason and it is unnatural 
act of 100%. We've recognized that and 
we were working our way down over a period of years to 50% and we decide 
to bite the bullet and get it done in 2014 and bring ourselves back where we 
think the industry will settle which is at 50% deferrals. We are st
ill high 
relatively to our competitors so certainly from a shareholder perspective it 
remains a very friendly concept. It continues to tie our employees into the 
firm which is what we want and what they want as evidenced by a low 
attrition. And, no, I am n
ot concerned about the onesies and twosies who 
choose to go into different paths of the financial sector, we get very 
attractive employee base coming in this firm and as frankly it's just not an 
issue.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Jam
es Mitchell with Buckingham 
Research. Please go ahead with your question.
 
James Mitchell
 
Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up quickly on the low
--
 
the funding 
costs trajectory. I guess first is there any 
--
 
you highlight again 25% by 
2016, is there
 
--
 
is that presumption of the rate environment or is that 
pretty much locked in? Just how should we think about that net benefit?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the funding cost reduction reflects the forward curve so it builds in that 
--
 
those higher rate, so with kind o
f respect rate move we do swap our debt to 
floating because our assets are floating but it spills off the forward curve.
 
James Mitchell
 
Okay. So but any change in the forward curve would have an impact on that 
assumption, okay.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes.
 
James Mitche
ll
 
And then if we think about the funding cost target, if we just look at your 
interest expense from last year which I think was about $3.7 billion, that 
how we should think about the 25% reduction of that $3.7 billion?
 
Ruth Porat
 
No. There are obviously n
umber of components in that. So it is not quite 
straight forward as that.
 
James Mitchell
 
So would be a little less than that? You are not going to help, okay.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, you do modeling.
 
James Mitchell
 
And was there any meaningful CVA this quarter?
 
Ru
th Porat
 
CVA was a bit of drag this quarter and last year and positive last quarter. 
So, yes, just a bit but 
--
 
just a bit.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your 
question.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Thanks. First question just on the FIC outlook for RWA. Just want to see if 
you had any I guess lost revenues related to going from the $188 billion 
down to say $155 billion?
 
Ruth Porat
 
One of the points we've made over time is th
at these are 
--
 
we call them 
dead weight, it is really dead weight capital and that it is supporting assets 
that aren't generating revenue worth funding old positions and so they are 
negative ROE now. And they were loss, they go from negative ROE to 
neutra
l to zero and the objective is then to take that excess capital and put 
it behind client activity and areas that are most accretive to the overall 
franchise. But the most important point is they are negative ROE because 
--
 
it is really just the financing c
ost on these long dated positions.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay. And then just on expenses for the legal the $284 million, , I just 
wanted to be clear because it seems like each quarter there are some legal 
cost, obviously at the firm. But is this just related to 
the residential 
mortgage in a matter or is that everything in the quarter? And if it wasn't, 
just what was your kind of your normal legal in the quarter?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So what we call that was as we said related to the residential.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay, got i
t. And then last one just in terms of the 
--
 
where your CG1 ratio 
is, just given we had the buffers out there, where do you expect to run the 
ratio in a longer term? And then based on the Basel and SFR, any update or 
any guidance in terms of how you guys s
tand?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of the buffer on the various ratios sought, we are in a very 
strong position as we said, fully phased in standardized, 11.7, advanced 
12.4, well above requirement even with estimates of what may occur with 
the incremental buffe
r and at this point given these are required over time 
not just are quantifying above or above that. But we got a 
--
we are running 
substantially above the requirement which is again consistent with our view 
that we have capacity to continue to return capit
al. As it relates to the net 
stable funding ratio, we are above a 100% as currently proposed by Basel, 
obviously still awaiting the final US rules. And you probably heard me say 
too often that we firmly believe in the durability of funding is imperative an
d 
that's how we run the firm. One concern about the rule is that it actually 
isn't proper ALM, and certain transactions which create liquidity in practice 
or our consumers of liquidity under the NSFR construct. I think it's notable 
that this element, the r
ule has been left to national regulators to tailor in the 
final rules. But short answer to your question, we are in a strong position 
with NSFR as it stands and that's keeps us in a strong position to deliver for 
clients.

Your next question comes 
from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. 
Please go ahead with your question.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Hi, good morning. So, James, you noted in your discussion on FIC that in 
addition to shrinking RWAs, you also managed to shrink actual fixed balance 
sheet assets 
and when looking at the product level commentary or 
disclosure you provided, it does appear that businesses that are actually 
generating returns below their cost of equity are more concentrated in those 
areas like global rates where they are more balance s
heet or leverage 
intensive than risk intensive. I just want to get an understanding as to how 
much more optimization potential we could see on the asset side of the 
equation that could help improve returns over the next couple of years?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, le
t me take that couple of point. Year
-
on
-
year, we had a sizable decline 
in our balance sheet and that is at the same time that we were increasing 
deposits. We have this ongoing contractual on boarding of deposit 
supporting our lending business. So what that
 
really reflects is optimization 
and trading businesses and that's primarily within fixed income. And so we 
are continuing advertise lends on balance sheet as we go into this year. 
There is some growth from deposits and we are very focused on making 
sure t
o the heart of your question that we are using every 
--
 
all assets, all 
resources where we can drive the strongest return and that's been part of 
the optimization on balance sheet to date. I think the other point is as I 
noted our SLR is at 5% and so we've
 
been 
--
 
we are in a good spot, we said 
we will be there in 2015. We are here as we ended 2014. And again that 
gives us 
--
 
so we've got ample opportunity and what we are looking it as to 
how drive returns.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Thanks, Ruth. And then just one more
 
question on ISG, actually switching 
over to the expense side. I appreciate the disclosure on the comp target for 
2015 assuming a flat revenue environment. I was hoping if you can give 
some color as to what the non personnel ratio should look like ex legal
 
going 
in 2015, also assuming that you have a flat revenue environment for the 
coming year.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I don't have that with me.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Okay. And then just one quick final one on wealth management. Did 
appreciate the disclosure on the yield opportu
nity for the bank, but just 
giving your expectation as to how the funding your liability profile evolve, 
what the reasonable expectations for what the NIM trajectory should look 
like over the coming years, not just assuming a flat revenue environment 
but a
lso contemplating the future yield opportunities that you highlighted on 
the asset side?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the reason we laid out as we did, if we wanted to give you the growth in 
the slide that James went through on the bank as we also broke up the split 
between deposits supporting growth and institutional securities versus 
wealth management, we are seeing growth in both and we laid out the yield. 
So that you can actually, you can model it out over time.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of 
Matt O'Connor with Deutsche 
Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Good morning. I was just hoping the follow up on the timing of the 10% ROE 
target. You talk about relatively stable macro trends in terms of trading, 
investment banking. So
 
it seems like it is more about execution and call it 
the passage of time specifically in FIC, so I guess as you think about the 
timing, is this 2015 target? Is this a five year target? Just trying to push a 
little bit on this.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Look, as James sa
id we have given you the key drivers of it and not putting 
a date on it, but you see the key drivers of it and certain other steps that we 
took as we ended this year. Put a fine point on certain of the elements that 
will drive ROEs higher, for example the 
change in comp structure enabling 
us to take down the comp ratio and some of the other elements that we 
have delineated, so I will be repetitive I go through, we are no putting a 
date on it but you can see the actions we've taken put, it will give clarity 
about execution against them.
 
James Gorman
 
I can promise you one thing though. It is not a five year target.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Okay and then in terms of the capital against it, obviously you've got 
probably more than you need on the Basel III ratio, the SLR co
uld be the 
constraining factor for you guys and the peers. How do you think about how 
much SLR you need to run? And is there some opportunity to optimize that 
more so than say the Basel ratio?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, at this point as he said we got a strong exces
s above requirement on 
risk based capital and given the SLR it is not required until 2018 as I just 
said. We were looking to get to 5% in 2015 and here we are at 5% now. So 
we don't view that as a constraint on our ability to return capital. At this 
point,
 
there are continues to be opportunity to mitigate as really primarily 
and reduction of the gross
-
 
up in the balance sheet, net long CDS sold and 
compression activity, obviously the ratio will continue to benefit from 
earnings but more in the gross up on t
he balance sheet and when you look 
across the ratios, given all that we've done with the business and given the 
strength of where we stand today and capital, that's why our view is we set 
ourselves up well to continue to steadily increase return of capital
 
over time. 
Our philosophy is no discontinues move but steady increases over time and 
that's what we remain focused on.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Okay and just separately a follow up question on the changes to the comp 
structure. Am I thinking correctly that essential
ly taking the charge on the 
cash, deferred cash piece, that will benefit you the most in the early years 
and then less later years?
 
Ruth Porat
 
It will continue to benefit us. So it is 
--
 
both of them benefit us and that's 
why we are free setting the comp r
atio here today.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, 
everyone. Let me get straight into it. 
Obviously, 2016 got off to a difficult start. Markets were challenging, equity 
issuance was effectively non
-
existent, and retail activity was extremely 
subdued, reflecting the many uncertainties with which investors g
rappled. 
These included negative interest rates internationally, questions around the 
pace of Fed activity in the U.S., the growth rate of the Chinese economy, 
and growing concerns about geopolitical issues like the migration crisis and 
potential for Brexi
t, among others.
 
The securities businesses were exposed to a number of these factors, which 
led to a more challenging revenue environment than what we have come to 
expect in the first quarter of the year. That said all was not lost. M&A was 
robust, equitie
s once again delivered a strong performance, and Wealth 
Management generated a pre
-
tax margin greater than 21% despite market 
headwinds and fewer trading days. We made real progress in our expense 
discipline ahead of our broader initiative called Project S
treamline, which, as 
we said, will play out over the next two years.
 
So, where are we now? Though it's impossible to predict the future, we're 
seeing a slightly better turn in markets, certainly, in comparison to what was 
evident at the start of the first 
quarter, leading into the early days of 
February.
 
The M&A pipeline is strong and some green shoots suggest the equity 
underwriting calendar may open up. The S&P level at the end of the first 
quarter will help with asset pricing in our Wealth Management bus
iness, 
where we continue to grow our lending book and see flows into managed 
accounts. Importantly, fixed income, notwithstanding the 25% cut in head 
count, improved sequentially. By no means can FIC be considered strong, 
but the business is showing some r
esilience in this difficult environment.
 
In January we laid out our strategic goals for 2016 and 2017. While we have 
yet to see the revenue growth we anticipated, it remains early days. In a 
minute, Jon would take you through the progress we have made to d
ate. It 
must be said that if these markets were to continue as is, our goals will be 
extremely difficult to achieve and we would therefore take additional 
appropriate actions. We obviously accept a degree of volatility in the 
revenue environment that has l
ed to lower revenue pools, although, we do 
not expect this as a permanent state.
 
We also recognize that we cannot control the environment in which we 
operate, but we are focused on what we can control such as expenses. As 
part of Streamline, we are reshapi
ng our expense base, and have embarked 
on an aggressive evaluation of our global infrastructure costs, reviewing 
each product, business and geography globally to convince ourselves that 
we need our footprint as it is currently configured.
 
We operate under 
a multitude of capitol tests and requirements. In January, 
we discussed our belief that we have sufficient capital for our business mix 
and risk profile and we're taking actions that should result in longer
-
term 
reduced capital requirements. For SLR and CE
T1, we are well in excess of 
the requirements in which we will be subject to in 2018 and 2019, 
respectively.
 
In terms of capital return, which has been one of the cornerstones of our 
strategic plan, our binding constraint is CCAR. To be clear, this is not 
a 
comment with respect to our capital return plans for this year, which we 
deem appropriate, but more for the following years. In order to drive capital 
returns to shareholders on a more substantial base than our current CCAR 
submission is asking for, we m
ust continue to reduce those parts of our 
business that give rise to the high stress losses and capital deductions 
and/or balance sheet usage. While in a difficult quarter, we still made $1 
billion dollars, our ROE was 6%. This is not acceptable.
 
Finally, 
we received feedback last week on our resolution plan, which was 
deemed credible by the FDIC, but, on account of one deficiency, was 
deemed not credible by the Federal Reserve. As you saw, we received very 
detailed comments, and we're confident we'll be ab
le to address the items 
that were raised.
 
We have dedicated significant resources and time to this important priority 
and will continue to work with our regulators to improve it. This 
management team would do what is necessary to ensure that we continue to
 
progress against our strategic plan. I look forward to doing an update at the 
Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in June.
 
So, let me now turn it over to Jon to walk through the quarter in greater 
detail. Thank you.

Chief Financial Offi
cer & Executive Vice President
 
Thanks, James. Good morning. As James said, the beginning of 2016 got off 
to a challenging start as negative sentiment and volatility prevailed in the 
global markets, undermining the traditional strength and client activity w
e 
have typically seen at the start of the year.
 
Concerns about global growth, China, commodities, and interest rates 
resulted in divergent performance of global indices and mixed results across 
international markets. Against this turbulent backdrop, we rem
ain focused 
on delivering for our clients and helping them navigate these difficult 
markets. We continued to demonstrate strength in our equities and M&A 
businesses and stability in Wealth Management.
 
For the quarter, we reported revenues of $7.8 billion, 
essentially flat versus 
fourth quarter 2015 when excluding DVA for the fourth quarter. During the 
first quarter, we early adopted the accounting guidance that requires that 
DVA be presented in accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed 
to net revenu
es. Results for previous quarters shown in the supplement 
were not subject to restatement under the guidance. In my remarks, the 
prior period amounts exclude DVA.
 
Non
-
interest expense for the quarter were $6.1 billion dollars, comprised of 
$3.7 billion of 
compensation expense and $2.4 billion of non
-
compensation 
expenses. We remain focused on reducing expenses and, as James 
mentioned, Streamline initiatives have begun to take shape.
 
Some of the areas we are focused on in Streamline include: first, our 
workf
orce strategy. We continue to remix our global workforce and have 
approximately 40% of our infrastructure employees in our centers of 
excellence around the world. We are targeting to increase the number of 
employees deployed by 10% to 15%, and are actively
 
working toward 
achieving this by year
-
end 2017.
 
Many of the initiatives involve leveraging best
-
in
-
class technologies. For 
instance, we are adopting virtualization and private cloud computing to 
increase agility and asset utilization, while achieving a si
gnificant reduction 
in our data center expenses. We are building the next
-
generation Wealth 
Management desktop and mobile suite for both our financial advisors and 
clients, while optimizing and automating our operations and work flow.
 
We're also partnering
 
with incumbent technology companies and emerging 
startups on a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and lower costs. 
And lastly, we are focused on rationalizing our footprint and infrastructure to 
ensure we are as efficient and productive as possib
le. In particular, there are 
opportunities across our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management 
businesses where we have the ability to drive efficiencies while improving 
collaboration.
 
Turning to Institutional Securities, revenues were $3.7 billion, 
up 5% quarter 
on quarter. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, 
down 13% versus the fourth quarter, driven by a decline in professional 
services. Compensation expenses were $1.4 billion, reflecting a 37% ISG 
compensation ratio.
 
In in
vestment banking, we saw continued strength in our M&A business, 
offset by a tougher backdrop for our underwriting businesses. IPO volumes 
were down 82% quarter on quarter, and high
-
yield volumes were down off 
of already low levels in the fourth quarter. F
or the quarter, we generated 
$990 million in revenues, down 18% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the 
quarter were the strongest post
-
crisis at $591 million, up 15% as the deals 
announced last year continue to close.
 
Equity underwriting revenues were $16
0 million, down 55% versus 4Q, 
driven largely by the significant decreases in IPOs. Fixed income 
underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 31% versus the fourth 
quarter, reflecting a slowdown in high
-
yield and leveraged loan markets.
 
In equities, we sa
w continued leadership with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 
13% sequentially. Prime brokerage revenues were higher this quarter as we 
work closely with our clients and continue to focus on the efficiency of our 
balance sheet and returns.
 
Derivatives revenues 
were up sequentially driven by increased client 
activities, as clients tried to navigate volatility and hedge risk exposures. 
And cash equity revenues were down versus 4Q against the backdrop of 
lower global equity markets and a limited new issue calendar.
 
And we 
continue to show leadership in our electronic products suite.
 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $873 million, 
up 59% versus the fourth quarter, although, down 54% versus the first 
quarter of 2015 when we had a very strong c
ommodities quarter, both in our 
Oil Merchanting business, which we sold in 4Q last year, and our 
commodities trading businesses.
 
Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuation of the challenges 
experienced in the second half of 2015. This translated into ongoing muted 
levels of client activity across our Fixed Income & Commodities business. 
Despite these headwinds and the 25% reducti
on in head count, we 
maintained our client focus and improved results from the fourth quarter.
 
We saw some improvement quarter
-
over
-
quarter in corporate credit with 
strength in investment grade, and we saw continued weakness across 
commodities. Fixed incom
e RWAs were down $4 billion in the quarter to 
$132 billion. And our SLR balance sheet was down approximately $9 billion 
to $345 billion.
 
While revenues for the quarter were up sequentially, they are not where we 
ultimately want them to be. We're focused on
 
driving execution and bringing 
our sales and trading businesses together to leverage synergies across the 
platform.
 
Other sales and trading revenues were down quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven by 
hedging losses for our relationship lending book. Other revenues
 
were down 
versus fourth quarter, driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses 
for our held for investment portfolio.
 
In the quarter, we have continued to see pressure on the energy complex 
and have seen some credit migration and some bankruptcie
s. Our loan
-
loss 
provision on our HFI portfolio of $127 million this quarter was predominantly 
against our energy portfolio. As a reminder, 40% of our approximately $15 
billion funded and unfunded energy exposure is fair value or held for sale, 
where we ma
rk
-
to
-
market daily and have taken markdowns this quarter.
 
Our energy exposure is down about $1 billion dollars from last quarter. And 
importantly, we have not seen any meaningful signs of contagion. Lastly, 
average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was fl
at versus last quarter at 
$46 million.
 
Wealth Management revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, down 
2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting muted client activity in an 
unfavorable market environment as well as fewer trading days. Our PBT 
margi
n for the quarter was 21.4%, up slightly versus 4Q15, reflecting the 
stability of the business. Bright spots for the quarter were continued 
momentum in our lending strategy and the ongoing secular trends to 
manage accounts. Flows for the quarter were appro
ximately $6 billion with 
decent pickup in March.
 
The NII story continues with net interest income up 7% sequentially and 
21% year
-
over
-
year, driven by solid loan growth. Funded lending balances 
in Wealth Management grew approximately $2 billion or 5% durin
g the 
quarter and $12 billion or 30% year
-
over
-
year. Credit metrics remain strong 
with an average FICO score of greater than 750 for our mortgage borrowers.
 
Transactional activity was particularly weak as clients remained on the 
sidelines due to market vol
atility and a lack of new issues. The first quarter 
for commission revenues were the lowest we have seen in the last five 
years, reflecting the very cautious attitude of investors in this highly 
uncertain environment. As global and domestic uncertainties a
bate, we 
would expect a return to a more normal level of activity.
 
On the expense side, compensation was down 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, 
driven by lower deferred compensation plans returns. Non
-
compensation 
expenses were down 5% versus fourth quarter, driven
 
by seasonally lower 
expenses in marketing and business development. Deposits in our bank 
deposit program were $152 billion in the first quarter, up $3 billion versus 
the fourth quarter, though lower than the quarter's peak, reflecting some 
improvement in 
client activities as market conditions have improved.
 
In Investment Management, revenues were $477 million, down 23% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter 
were $526 million, up 5% versus 4Q, reflecting the steadiness of 
this 
revenue line, and AUM was essentially unchanged at $405 billion. 
Investment revenues in the quarter were a loss of $64 million, driven by 
volatility and particular weakness in emerging market investments, resulting 
in mark
-
downs and some reversal of c
arry. Overall, expenses were down 
13% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven by compensation, which was down 23%.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $808 billion at March 31, up 
from the $787 billion at December 31. The increase reflects a low fourth 
qu
arter spot asset level given lower client activity at the end of the year as 
well as higher levels of liquidity in the first quarter. Our average balance 
sheet, however, was down to $802 billion in the quarter from $814 billion in 
4Q.
 
Pro forma fully phase
d in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be 
approximately $386 billion, down from $395 billion in the fourth quarter. Our 
pro forma fully phased in Basal III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio 
increased to 14.5%. Our pro forma supplementary leverage r
atio for the 
quarter was 6%, up from 5.8% in Q4.
 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock, or 
approximately 25 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend 
per share. Lastly, in the quarter, as you will see in our su
pplement, we 
modified our segment common equity allocation disclosure to base it on fully 
phased in regulatory capital, as the market has focused more on these ratios 
than the transitional ratios.
 
As we've said in the past, we look at capital through multi
ple lenses, so this 
is not a totally new view for us. Capital is allocated based on risk
-
based and 
leverage
-
based requirements under both business
-
as
-
usual as well as stress 
scenarios. This resulted in a reduction in parent equity from $21 billion to $6 
bi
llion, and the resulting $15 billion is allocated across the segments. We will 
now allocate equity to our segments only at the beginning of the year, and it 
will remain fixed throughout the year.
 
Turning to the outlook, across sales and trading, we do not 
believe that the 
backdrop we saw in the first quarter will become a permanent state and 
have already seen some improvement in market conditions. However, given 
the numerous uncertainties across regions, we would expect to see some 
uneven markets and client
 
activity. We are engaged with our clients and 
focused on delivering content, liquidity and solutions.
 
In banking, M&A pipelines are healthy and client dialogs remain strong, but 
we would expect a slowdown from last year's elevated pace. We are 
cautiously 
optimistic that equity underwriting volumes will improve after a 
very muted first quarter, probably more weighted to the second half. We 
have seen IPOs in the U.S. and EMEA starting to come to market. How these 
transactions are received will be important t
o confidence going forward.
 
In debt underwriting, we would expect the investment grade markets to 
remain stable and are seeing signs of life in the non
-
investment grade 
markets, although still selective at the bottom of the capital structure. In 
Wealth Man
agement, we would expect to see the stability and trends seen in 
the last several quarters to continue. And in Investment Management, we 
expect the asset management fees to remain stable and expect potential 
lumpiness in the investments line. We will conti
nue to focus on Project 
Streamline and managing our risk profile.
 
With that, we will open up the line to questions.
 
Question

Operator
 
Our first question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America. Your line is open.
 
Mich
ael Roger Carrier

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks, guys. James, maybe first one for you and this is based off of the 
strategic update that you provided last quarter, just on the ROE target. Just 
wanted to get a sense, when you think of 

 
in that sit
uation, I think 
revenues were up maybe low
-
single digits; a lot of that being driven by the 
Wealth Management segment. And then, in this environment, obviously, the 
whole industry has some weakness and revenues are down 20% for you 
guys. So when we think a
bout those targets in that revenue range of up low
-
single digits to down 20%, how much of the cost structure can be managed, 
particularly, if we're not 

 
obviously, not down 20%, but even if we're plus 
or minus 5% on the revenue base, is that still an envi
ronment where, by the 
end of 2017, the targets are still attainable?
 
James Patrick Gorman 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Good morning, Mike. I think, first of all, the targets are, as you point out, 
2017 targets, and they did have in them 

 
they were
 
driven in part by three 
efforts. One was Project Streamline and the ability to take out $1 billion 
dollars of compensation, non
-
compensation expenses, assuming a flat 
revenue environment. The second was modest revenue growth of 3% to 
5%; and then, of cour
se, continuance of our capital plans.
 
I think it's 

 
I know we're going to get a lot of calls on this, because that's 
the perils of putting out a target is you get asked about it every time, every 
quarter until you finally get there. But we did put it out 
for 2017, so I think 
it's very early days here. This was an 

 
as we said, an unusual backdrop. I 
think everybody would acknowledge the calendar was very weak. As we 
said, retail investors were very skittish. We still had some cleanup in the 
Investment Mana
gement area. So it was an unusual backdrop.
 
So, we're not really at the stage of second guessing those targets at this 
point. What I was trying to make clear in my opening comments that we're 
definitely not standing still. If indeed the environment continu
ed as is, we 
would be much more aggressive on the cost front. That's our job, and we 
intend to do it. I'm not about to project what that means in terms of targets. 
We're standing by our 9% to 11% by the end of 2017. And let's see how this 
plays out over a 
couple of quarters. But we're very focused on this.
 
We think this business mix is attractive against those kinds of targets. We 
have no problem with that. We think we're in a position where over time 
we're going to be doing increasing capital 
distributions. We believe that the 
markets are unlikely to be at the level that we were at in the first quarter, 
but, again, we have to deal with reality. If it turns out that is the case, we'll 
react accordingly.
 
Michael Roger Carrier

Bank of America Me
rrill Lynch
 
Okay. Thanks. And then, just as a follow up, maybe on the Wealth 
Management business. You're still 

 
pretty good trends for what you guys 
can control. Just given that we have got the final Department of Labor 
fiduciary role, just wanted to get 
your sense on 

 
as we have to implement 
that, some of the either pressures the business, how much from a cost 
structure has already been put into the budget, and so from a pre
-
tax 
margin standpoint, any really change on that? And just your view overall on 
how to manage that business with the new rule.
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure, Mike. It's Jon. We're still digesting sort of all the nitty
-
gritty of the final 
rule, but I think, as we've said in the past, we had b
een preparing for this 
eventuality for a while now, and we've been investing for this eventuality. 
And when we put out our 23% to 25% margin target for next year, we had 
this in mind. As we said, we have the largest advisory platform in the 
industry, as we
ll as significant investments in our digital platform. So we 
think that we're well positioned here. We're going to work with our clients to 
provide solution to their investment needs, and I think, by the end of the 
day, overall impact to both our clients a
nd our financial results are very 
manageable.
 
James Patrick Gorman 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I'd just add one thing to that. The DoL ruling, obviously, it's good to have it 
in writing, so we know what we're dealing with. And, frankly, given the 
annuitization focus of the business that's sort of consistent with where we as 
a firm have been going. But it's one of many things that are going on in that 
business. And I would 

 
as Jon said, I would pay attention to many of the 
things, including the gro
wth in the bank, the expense savings, the digital 
strategy that we're putting in place. There are a lot of things going on that 
we'll be updating over the next 12 months. This was an important one, but 
it's not the be
-
all and the end
-
all.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP 
Securities. Your line is open.
 
Devin P. Ryan 
-
 
JMP Securities LLC
 
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just another one he
re on GWM and, 
really, just thinking about the contribution of kind of managed accounts 
relative to the existing business, and is that shift , is that accretive or 
dilutive to profitability in the segment? And then, I guess, you just alluded to 
this, but w
ith bringing on some executives with digital expertise, how should 
we think about the role of robo advice tools within your broader set of 
services to clients?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So, a couple of questions t
here. I think in terms of the trends in the 
business, again, we've been very pleased with the stability of this business. 
We've been investing in this business for a while. We've been yielding the 
synergies of bringing the two platforms together, bringing 
the teams 
together, and the results have been reasonably stable in what is a difficult 
backdrop.
 
The digital platform is a really exciting opportunity for us. We've talked 
about a couple of things as being sort of secular trends. The role of managed 
accoun
t and people wanting advice for their balances is something that we 
can continue and was one of the premises for the merger of Smith Barney in 
the first place and we saw that continue.
 
We've got about $800 billion in managed accounts now, about 40% of our 
assets, and we think we can continue to grow that. And so that is a very 
important part of the strategy, and I think the digital strategy is just going 
to help provide our clients with the types of services they need. We have 
over 2.5 million households. M
any of our clients like to interface with their 
advisors on the phone; some like to come in; some like to use technology. 
So making sure we have good products and services across that full 
spectrum is going to be important and I think the recent hire that 
we made 
on our digital strategy to lead that in Wealth Management is really going to 
yield some interesting innovations going forward.
 
Devin P. Ryan 
-
 
JMP Securities LLC
 
Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, with respect to trading, 
particularly in F
IC, it sounds like the quarter ended on a better note, so can 
you just maybe help us think about that as it carry into April and is it 

 
across businesses and really within credit specifically, it seems like that was 
one area that was a little bit of a hea
dwind, so how are markets there and 
how's activity started this quarter?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Well, in terms of the FIC performance in terms of the different items, I 
highlighted some pickup in credit. I woul
d say, as you know, we're more 
oriented towards the credit products, and we saw some modest 
improvement in those areas, but still a difficult backdrop and challenging 
environment for those products, so they're still below where we would like to 
see them an
d below their historical levels.
 
On the macro side, our rates business held in okay. FX was clearly slower, 
given our footprint as well as sort of the more muted volatility that we saw 
in the FX rates this quarter. But, all in all, again, it was a decent q
uarter for 
us in light of the backdrop and in light of our business mix. We did see a 
pickup towards the end of March that sort of followed through a little bit 
here in the first couple of weeks of April, although, obviously, the events 
over the weekend an
d what we've seen in Asia and some of the commodities 
is just a stark reminder that we're going to continue to see periods of 
volatility here.
 
Devin P. Ryan 
-
 
JMP Securities LLC
 
Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just on that note, the fair mark 

 
fair value mark within the energy book, did you disclose that?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
No. No, we did not.
 
Devin P. Ryan 
-
 
JMP Securities LLC
 
Okay. Can you provide any additional color on that?
 
Jonathan 
Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Again, from an energy perspective what I would say is that 40% is both fair 
value and held for sale, the held for sale marks you'll see run through other 
revenues. The fair value will run through 
the sales and trading line items, 
and we mark to mark that daily.

Just following up on fixed income to start here. Obviously, a lot of moving 
pieces with a weak macro, restructuring that you're doing, but as you think 
about kind of more of a steady state or a typical first quarter, and I can 
appr
eciate it's very hard to frame, but are you thinking leverage of kind of 
50% higher from where we are here or how are you right
-
sizing the cost 
base? What revenue environment are you thinking the business is capable of 
generating?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief F
inancial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Let me try to tackle that. There were a couple of different components there. 
But let's 

 
first of all, let's put it into context when we look at the first 
quarter of 2015 versus the first quarter of this year. I
 
said back in March 
that wasn't a good starting point for comparison for a couple of reasons.
 
First of all, if you recall last year, we benefited from the extreme weather in 
the first quarter. Not only was that from our physical oil business, but we 
saw si
gnificantly higher levels of client activity. Since also the first quarter of 
last year, we continue to restructure and reshape this business both in terms 
of its footprint and capital intensity. We've sold the Oil Merchanting 
business. In the first quarte
r or at the end of last year, we had about $190 
billion of RWA dedicated to the business and, today, that number is closer to 
$130 billion.
 
More recently, we changed the leadership, and then in December we took 
out 25% of the head count. So this is a diffe
rent model 

 
excuse me, a 
different business. It's got less capital, it's more focused, and in short, we're 
undertaking a major restructuring. It's against a difficult backdrop. The 
backdrop has been more negative against our more credit
-
oriented 
businesse
s. And we had a decent quarter. I wouldn't say it was a great 
quarter, but it was certainly decent, and we want to build on the early 
progress that we've seen here.
 
We don't expect to see the types of quarters that we saw in the first quarter 
of 2015, but 
we are focused on doing better and getting more consistent 
results. You asked about profitability levels. I think, in January, when we 
rolled out the strategy, we said we wanted a credible and critical fixed 
income business. We were going to take capital o
ut. We were going to take 
cost out. We were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint and, 
therefore, it was obviously going to improve the overall profitability of the 
business.
 
The last couple of years, we've generated somewhere in the order of $4.2
 
billion or $4.3 billion of revenue. We're trying to maintain that revenue base. 
The first quarter is slightly below that run rate, but it's a, again, decent 
result. And we're still focused on trying to maintain that revenue footprint.
 
Matthew Derek O'Conn
or 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, the non
-
comp cost came 
down nicely both linked
-
quarter and year
-
over
-
year. I think there's still quite 
a bit of benefit to come from your initiatives there. But just walk u
s through 
how we think about the trajectory both maybe heading into 2Q and 3Q, and 
then I think most of the savings you talked about hitting next year and just 
reiterate that that's still the case.
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice
 
President
 
Yeah. No, I think that's the right way to think about it. Some of the 
comments I mentioned about the initiatives underway are really going to 
take 

 
those things take time to evolve into the cost savings. We're making 
good progress. And, as I me
ntioned before, the Streamline initiatives, many 
of them will hit towards the back half of this year and next year. But the 
progress that we've made to date is just a maniacal focus on making sure 
we control our discretionary spend and we're being very pru
dent here.
 
Matthew Derek O'Connor

Thank you. 
Good morning. Thanks for the reallocation disclosure on the 

 
on 
the fully phased capital. That's helpful to understand what the real capital 
usage of the different business lines is. I guess my question on the back of 
that though is there any change to th
e expectation that FIC, as a result of 
the strategic actions that you took late last year, that it could free up more 
than $5 billion to $8 billion in capital over time? Now, that we see $43 billion 
in ISG capital, the $5 billion to $8 billion free
-
up give
n how much of that $43 
billion we know must belong to FIC seems like it's not actually that much.
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Listen, I think that the plan that we laid out in January in terms of the 
actions around 
the balance sheet and SLR footprint leads to about $5 billion 
to $8 billion of freed
-
up capital. We said in the past that we might reinvest 
some of that back into other ISG businesses, so that line item might not 
move as people would expect, but, again, we
're going to evaluate all of our 
businesses and all of our assets and investments to see if we can be more 
capital efficient. Right now, we think that $5 billion to $8 billion is the right 
number.

'd just add, Guy, the real game in town relating to capital is CCAR and we're 
approaching 

 
I think we're approaching a point in time when the basic 
architecture of the CCAR model will be in place. That doesn't mean that the 
actual scenarios won't change y
ear to year, of course, they're going to 
change year to year, but the architecture will be in place.
 
By that I mean, I think next year we'll see the G
-
SIB buffer put into CCAR, 
and when that is put in, there are likely to be various other changes, as I 
und
erstand it, to the CCAR model, which would net against the G
-
SIB buffer. 
Once we have all of that under the four ratios in CCAR and each of them 
over their nine quarters, we'll have a much better sense of what our true 
capital buffer is.
 
So, at the moment,
 
we're sailing a little bit blind. The numbers we have laid 
out is what we see as sort of visible buffer right now. But our hope is that, 
over time 

 
this is not the final end state for us in terms of excess capital. 
We think over time that we will have mo
re excess capital than that, but to 
get there, we need to do it within the confines of what the CCAR stress tests 
are demanding. And as we get the final 

 
what I think is likely to be the final 
architecture of CCAR next year 

 
again, not the final models, 
but the final 
architecture, we will be able to adjust our business models accordingly.

That's fair and helpful in terms of how you're thinking about it. Thanks. 
Maybe a follow
-
up on that is as the fixed income bus
iness continues to 
evolve, it would seem that it is going to evolve to be more of a digital 
market business with probably less of a human, but also probably over time 
still less of an economic capital footprint associated with it. Is that fair? And 
could y
ou talk about your vision for fixed income now that Ted has been 
overseeing it for a long enough time to maybe start to think about how it 
becomes more digital?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yeah. Sure, Guy. We do thi
nk that there are some trends in the fixed income 
business that will lead themselves to more electronification. We've talked 
about certain areas of FX and other places. As you know, we have true 
leadership in our electronic product suite in equities, and w
e're going to use 
some of that learning to see if we can migrate that into the fixed income 
area; but we do see further electronification. The speed in which that 
happens is obviously going to be determined over time, and we do think we 
are well
-
positioned
 
given our leadership that we've shown in digital and 
electronic products in the past.
 
Guy Moszkowski 
-
 
Autonomous Research US LP
 
Thanks. That's all helpful. And then just one final question, which is more on 
the current credit environment in energy and ma
terials and mining. Can you 
give us a sense for what your loan loss reserve as a percent of exposure is 
for the banking book portion of those exposures?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Again, what I would say, Guy, is, 
as you know, not all of our portfolio is held 
for investment. A good chunk, 40%, is fair value and held for sale, which 
gets marked daily. I said in March at the conference that I was generally 
more concerned about the global macro backdrop and what that d
oes to the 
trading environment, and what that means for our client activity than our 
energy exposure.
 
So, I think we're going to continue to manage it tightly. We're trying to 
reduce it where we can. We've brought it down $1 billion dollars quarter
-
over
-
qu
arter. We continue to hedge as appropriate. We have seen the 
weakness. We would expect that would continue a bit, but, again, we're 
going to continue to manage it tightly.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with 
UBS. Your line is open.
 
Brennan McHugh Hawken 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A quick follow
-
up, Jon, 
the comment on maintaining the previous $
4.2 billion revenue footprint. You 
gave some helpful color there on the difficult environment and how you view 
the results, but maybe can you help us frame how to think about physical 
commodities going away? You've indicated how that reduces the seasonalit
y 
of FIC, but is there a way to sort of frame out how much of that revenue left 
with the sale closing, so we can think about the right jumping
-
off point?
 
And then, to follow up on the comments about the revenue environment 
adjustments versus 

 
and cutting 
costs further, has the improvement in 
March and April been enough for you to say that maybe you don't need to 
relook, or does that commentary include the improvement in March and 
April?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
O
kay. So, I would say a few things. One, we are 

 
the revenue target or 

 
is 
a goal, the run rate in the first quarter is slightly below that level. I think the 
fact that we no longer have the physical oil business should reduce the 
seasonality that we saw 
in this business, clearly, but also many of the 
changes that we've made are going to try to hopefully improve the 
consistency of this business. So, we would expect more quarters to look 
similar than the volatility that we've seen in the past, is the first 
comment.
 
Secondly, I do think that we obviously saw a pickup in March and the signs 
of early April. We think we can improve our results. They are still below sort 
of what we've seen historically, run rate, in some of our stronger product 
areas. And we expe
ct to improve our revenue results from this quarter. So, 
again, this is one quarter's results. This quarter is a decent starting point, 
because we didn't have the physical oil business in it, but we obviously had a 
difficult macro backdrop. But these numbe
rs are probably more reflective of 
the opportunity going forward than the first quarter of 2015. And this is a 
multi
-
year process; we're not going to see all of the changes in just one 
quarter.
 
James Patrick Gorman 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I'd just add a couple of points to that. Firstly, as it relates to commodities, a 
lot of focus on the revenue delta year
-
over
-
year, which I understand there 
was a cold snap last January that obviously flatted the commodities numbers 
there. And, obviously, 
not having the business had a reasonably material 
impact on the revenues, but the broader picture is strategically what we're 
trying to do. There is a reason that one of the regulators determined that we 
had a credible plan and the other found only one def
iciency; and part of it is 
because we have simplified our business model.
 
There's a reason that we're confident about Project Streamline, and part of it 
is because we have fewer businesses, less infrastructure, less legal entities; 
and what we did with com
modities and then selling the physical oil business, 
all gets at that simplification. It reduces RWAs, it reduces capital, it reduces 
risk, audit, compliance, legal, finance, oversight of that part of the business, 
and it's all about simplifying Morgan Sta
nley and making it a better 
understandable business from a regulatory perspective and from an investor 
perspective. Nothing that happened in the first quarter changes that view.
 
On the expense side, yeah, we've been grinding away at our non
-
comp 
expenses f
or a while. We've had some major headwinds with legal expenses, 
both with litigation and with the cost of lawyers in defending these various 
claims. We're clearly making progress on that. We have been focused, as 
Jon used the word maniacally, I think that'
s fair on our non
-
comp expenses. 
That is completely separate from Project Streamline.
 
Project Streamline is a major firm
-
wide initiative to figure out the most 
efficient way to run our infrastructure with the most efficient footprint. So, 
those two things 
will go unabated irrespective of whether the second quarter 
is strong or weak, whether first quarter was strong or weak. They are things 
which we have clearly on plan. We need to get the ROE of this business up, 
and one of the ways we're going to do that i
s being much more efficient in 
our expense management.
 
Brennan McHugh Hawken 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Excellent. Thanks for all that color. And then, thinking about the loan book 
here, you all saw NII grow faster than loans here this quarter in Wealth 
Manageme
nt. And so, it's right to think about the pickup in LIBOR probably 
benefiting the PLA portion of that loan book, right? Just the mechanics of 
that are the right way 

 
just want to verify that the mechanics of that are 
the right way to think about it.
 
And t
hen, thinking about the provision side of things, on the institutional 
side, just in the HFI piece, I think, provision was up around 200% versus 
last quarter. So that's just on HFI, not that 40% you were talking about 
before, right, Jon? And how should we 
think about that in a world where oil 
stays at about $30 a barrel?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Okay. Let's do loans first. As we've said in the past, we're excited about the 
bank strategy, what we call our deposit d
eployment strategy, taking our 
lower yielding cost 

 
lower yielding securities and converting them into 
loans. We've seen good progress. You mentioned LIBOR, I think we're more 
sensitive to the Fed funds rate. We've seen a little bit of pick
-
up, obviously,
 
given what happened in December. But I think the real growth in NII for us 
within the Wealth Management business is going to come from the fact that 
we expect the average earning assets to grow probably by 

 
in the bank to 
grow probably by $10 billion to 
$15 billion this year.
 
You saw some of the balances in the wealth business; it was up dramatically 
over last year's period. So, the key driver to NII growth in the bank, which a 
good portion of that flows through Wealth Management, is we're going to 
have m
ore average earning assets grow, yielding somewhere in this 2% 
range. So that's the driver to that and I would pay closer attention to Fed 
funds into LIBOR. And the second question was...
 
Brennan McHugh Hawken 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
The provision for the hel
d to investment.
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Oh, provision. So, the $127 million provision is for the totality of the firm. 
Some of that, as I said, the predominance was towards our energy portfolio. 
A small piece o
f that goes against our Wealth Management business, and 
then for our unfunded commitments, it's actually part of the expense line. 
But that $127 million was for the total firm, not just for ISG and energy.
 
Brennan McHugh Hawken 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Yeah, s
orry. I was talking actually about the ISG piece. I think you say in 
the footnote that it's $108.7 million this quarter versus $37 million, that 
was...
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yeah, no, that's right. And, again,
 
the vast majority of that is to the energy 
portfolio.
 
Brennan McHugh Hawken 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. And any color if oil stays low? Outlook?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Nothing different than what we've said in 
the past. We're very focused on it. 
We clearly would expect continued weakness and we're monitoring it very 
closely.
 
Brennan McHugh Hawken 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. Thanks for the color.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ma
yo with CLSA. 
Your line is open.
 
Mike Mayo 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Hi, the new CEO letter talks about progress with the business mix, banking 
equities and other areas, but the ROE, as you pointed out, was only 6% in 
the first quarter. And the ROE has been belo
w the cost of capital for the last 
decade. And the market further expects you to miss your 2017 ROE target of 
9% based on consensus earnings forecast. I might add based on a stock 
price below tangible book value. So the question is, do you think that you 
c
an still meet your 2017 ROE target of 9% and why?
 
And from my standpoint, there's three big levers. One would be expenses, 
which you've highlighted and you said (47:00) you could take more actions. 
Two would be markets getting better and you see early 
signs. But the third 
lever would be capital returns. And so, how soon can investors see some of 
that freed
-
up FIC capital? You had 5% annualized buybacks this quarter, 
which is decent, but you also mentioned on the call now that you can reduce 
the impact o
f businesses with high stress losses. What are those businesses, 
can you get rid of them and how big are those?
 
James Patrick Gorman 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Good morning, Mike. Nice to hear from you again. As you have, I think, 
pretty consiste
ntly been asking this management team to put a timeframe 
on our ROE goals and we did it in January. So in April, we're unlikely to back 
off of those goals, as I said, I think, to the first question, which might have 
been from Mike Carrier, I think, when he
 
asked about it. We stand by those 
goals. But, as I said, and they weren't caveats, they were just reality, they 
implied that we hit our expense targets on a flat revenue environment, that 
our total revenues grew somewhere between 3% and 5%, and that we di
d 
the right thing around right
-
sizing our fixed income business and freeing up 
the right capital.
 
As I think you said, we feel pretty good, honestly, about the expense 
targets. We made some really good progress against non
-
comp expenses 
and maintained comp
 
discipline before we really got into the meat of Project 
Streamline. So, I'd put a check against sort of early indicator on that one. 
On the revenue growth, clearly, we didn't have revenue growth. So that 
would be a negative at this point, one quarter int
o the program. But, clearly, 
things brighten up a little bit towards the end of the quarter.
 
Not going to get into the business of trying to predict stuff, but we would be 
surprised and, probably, you would be and most of the people on this call if 
this en
vironment stayed as is for the next two years. And hopefully, I was 
very clear that if it does, we will continue to take significant action. We're 
not going to stand and just watch it. And on the capital plan, we've just put 
in our CCAR submission. We had 
the G
-
SIB buffer coming in the next year's 
capital plan. Our CET1 fully phased in ratio, I think, is 14.5%, 14.6%. Our 
supplemental leverage ratio was 6%. A couple of years ago, the 
supplemental leverage was 4.2%. I think our CET1 fully phased in is 
probab
ly in the top 2 or top 3 of the global 15 or 17 banks. So we feel pretty 
very good about our capital ratios.
 
What we need to understand is how we come through CCAR. The stability of 
the scenario, obviously, changes every year depending upon economic 
condit
ions like interest rates and market shocks and the like. And as we see 
how the CCAR deals with certain parts of our business and the stress losses 
that are implied by that, we will adjust those businesses as necessary. It's 
too early to lay out what that m
ight be, because we haven't seen the results 
of it yet. But my main message to you and to our shareholders is that when 
we put out the 9% to 11%, again, subject to the revenue growth I talked 
about, which was modest, but was real, certainly, not subject to
 
negative 
revenue growth. We did it with a pretty well thought through plan that's 
been building.
 
And I'm the first to acknowledge that we haven't hit our cost of capital for 
the last several years. I think, without being defensive about it, it's fair to 
s
ay I'm not sure very many banks have. And I'm not sure that the 
denominator of what you're required to holding capital has been a standing 
ball, in fact, it's been a bouncing ball, but it's gone up every year. So, listen, 
we're making steady progress, we'r
e committed to our goals, we'll continue 
pushing on expenses, we'll do what we can to free up excess capital, and we 
believe the environment is likely to improve from where we saw the bottoms 
of the first quarter. More than that, I think, it's too early to
 
predict.

James Patrick Gorman

Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with 
Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
 
Glenn Paul Schorr 
-
 
Evercore ISI
 
Thank you. On the reallocation of capital, I'm curious on what brought that 
on, your own doing or conversations with the regulators? And then, focusing 
specifically on Wealth Management, to go from a 19% down to a 13%, I'm 
curious on how muc
h growth is built into that, given that you're reallocating 
once a year, meaning your loans grew 30% and deposits are growing 
significantly. How much growth is built in there? Because I'm assuming you 
feel like Wealth Management should be better than a 13%
 
ROE business.
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So, on your first question, in terms of, as you know, since taking over, I've 
been talking about 

 
we look at multiple lenses of capital. So we've been 
analyzing and lookin
g at our businesses under multiple frames for a while. 
As you notice from my prepared remarks and James' prepared remarks, we 
always keep referencing now fully phased in.
 
It seems like the market is not interested in what the actual transitional 
ratios are
 
and they're more focused on fully phased in. And so, at the end of 
the year, we thought it was the right time as we start 2016 from a disclosure 
standpoint to put in the fully phased in ratio numbers.
 
In terms of the second question, I actually 

 
my suppl
ement doesn't have it. 
Can I just 

 
I'm looking for the page. There we go. My supplement is 
missing page 12, Glenn. Here we you go. So in the first quarter of 2015, you 
saw the 19% Wealth Management ratio, I think the better comparison, the 
change in any c
apital allocation, if you look at the middle two columns, the 
business went from 14% to 12%. You saw that the revenues were slightly 
off this quarter and so we 

 
the PBG was down. Part of our Wealth 
Management business, as you properly point out, is a lend
ing business, and 
so when we move to the fully phased in ratios, we allocated more capital to 
that business, as it continues to grow in that high quality lending book.
 
The ROE for this quarter was slightly improved to 13%. We think that 
business can be bet
ter than the 13% ratio that we're showing, particularly, if 
we see some better signs in the transactional and the transactional activity. 
So we think we can build from 13%, but this business does require capital 
given our lending focus.
 
Glenn Paul Schorr 
-
 
Evercore ISI
 
Understood. And then, I forget, I'm not sure you broke out the actual, either 
accrual reversals or marks in Investment Management for the private equity 
and real estate funds, but just curious what you could tell us about the book 
and if all 
the prior accruals have been now reversed out?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
No, I didn't comment on that. So the investments line, which, as we've 
talked about in the past, has been lumpy, and it's really a function 
of the 
overall investment environment. That line represents not only the 
performance
-
based fees that we receive, but also reflects our investments in 
these funds. That number over the last 24, 25 quarters has really averaged 
about a little over $100 millio
n a quarter. It's been negative less than a 
handful of times. This quarter, it was negative. It was negative 64 million. 
About a third 

 
little less than a third of that, Glenn, was from reversal of 
carry. The rest was from investment markdowns.
 
And then, 
in terms of what we have left, as we've said in prior quarters, we 
have written a significant portion of our carry related to our Asia funds down 
at this point. But, going forward, we still have carry, really mostly in our 
infrastructure and real estate fu
nds, and we'll disclose the cumulative 
amount of that carry in our quarter 

 
excuse me 

 
in our Q, and you'll see 
that it has gone down this quarter.
 
Glenn Paul Schorr

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with 
Nomura. Your line is open.
 
Steven J. Chubak

Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
Hi, good morning.
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief 
Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Good morning.
 
Steven J. Chubak 
-
 
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
So wanted to dig in, Jon, into the capital allocation disclosure for a moment. 
And one of the questions we're getting quite a bit is how we 
should reconcile 
the revised fully phased in capital allocations that you have with essentially a 
CCAR required or spot required capital target; potentially, the minimum level 
of capital you'll need for CCAR to get through the test unscathed while also 
sup
porting higher payouts.
 
And the back
-
of
-
the envelope math suggests that, when we exclude the 
unallocated portion and goodwill and intangibles, you're allocating $52 billion 
across your businesses and as a percentage of risk
-
weighted assets, it's 
about a 13
% target, so a little bit higher than what we were contemplating 
previously. And I just wanted to get a sense as to whether 13% core Tier 1 
is a reasonable long
-
term target based on the current mix? And should we 
expect this to come down or how should we e
xpect it to traject as FIC 
mitigation efforts take hold?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So, I think I followed your math. I don't think that 13% number, that's not 

 
I wouldn't make that conclusion. As James mentioned,
 
CCAR is the binding 
constraint to capital return. Our capital allocation model is not a proxy, if 
you will, for the CCAR model, because the model, as James said, or the 
infrastructure is changing and the variables change year
-
over
-
year. But we 
will contin
ue to manage our capital efficiency and see if we can take more 
capital out of the businesses and return it to shareholders.
 
What our absolute level of 

 
our spot capital ratios won't be the ultimate 
determinant of how much capital we can return, but, actu
ally, the Fed's 
stress test in their severely adverse case will be the driving force about how 
much capital we can return. And that number is going to change as the test 
evolves.
 
Steven J. Chubak 
-
 
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
Okay. So, how much c
apital you need under CCAR is not explicitly 
contemplated, then, under these revised capital allocations that you've 
disclosed?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Correct.
 
Steven J. Chubak 
-
 
Nomura Securities International
, Inc.
 
Okay. Got it. Thank you for clarifying that. And just one more question. As it 
relates to your G
-
SIB scores, clearly you've made significant progress in 
reducing your RWAs. And some of your peers have noted they've moved into 
lower buckets. And I wa
s wondering whether you could disclose where you 
believe your surcharges stand today under both method 1 and method 2?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I think what we've said is that the G
-
SIB buffer for this year for u
s is 3%.
 
Steven J. Chubak 
-
 
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
And do you see room for you to move into a lower bucket, just given some 
of the actions that you're taking on the FIC side?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice Preside
nt
 
I think 

 
we obviously monitor that very closely, and if there's an 
opportunity to move to a lower bucket, we will clearly be focused on trying 
to do that, and what the trade
-
offs are between revenues and profitability; 
but we clearly monitor that. But,
 
at this point, we're in the 3% bucket.

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two questions. One was there was 
a recent Basel paper on revisions to the Basel III 
leverage framework. But I 
think in the past you've talked about the standardized counterparty credit 
risk impact. I wondered if you had any comments on whether that paper 
would make a big difference to your SLR. And the second issue is just on 
fixed income
. You mentioned $132 billion, I think, of RWAs, so you're 
making significant progress. Do you think it's likely you could reach the $120 
billion earlier than 2017? Is it that you're having success in the runoff of 
legacy assets? Thanks.
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
C
hief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. So I think the first question relates to the SACR (1:00:00) proposal. 
To be honest, I have reviewed it. I haven't spent a lot of time on it. And the 
first read is it could be beneficial to SLR ratio, 
but I don't think we have a 
quantification of that just yet. And then, on the second question, which was 

 
I'm sorry, Fiona, one more time?

(1:00:54) questions in the Wealth Management business. I guess 
commissions were down 18% year
-
over

year, you mentioned reduced retail 
risk appetite. Just curious if the Department of Labor rule had any impact on 
advisor b

On the first I would say, no. And on the second, I think the migration to 
managed accounts will have an impact on the transactional accounts, but 
these levels are really beyond the shift from transactional to managed 
money. S
o I think we can see a rebound from where we are today.

Okay. Fair. And then, on the comp ratio in GWM, you called out fair value 
and deferred 
comp in the release having an impact on the comp ratio; would 
be helpful if you could quantify that for us, just so we have a good jump
-
off 
point for next quarter.
 
Jonathan Pruzan

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
We'll look at it for fu
ture disclosures, but we don't disclose that number.

Okay. And just lastly, more of a bigger picture question. I guess really nice 
margin expan
sion in Wealth Management, but organic growth just remains 
poor or weak, whether measured by fee
-
based flows or financial advisor 
head count. I'm just curious if you think organic growth is necessary for the 
long
-
term health of this business?

Why don't I give Jon a break for a minute? And, by the way, we have 
extended this call for about 

 
we're going to extend it about ten minutes 
past the time. We're trying to give everybody a chance to get 
their questions 
in, so we'll be brief. As long as there is inflation of financial assets and as 
long as there is population growth, and as long as the business model 
remains relevant to wealthy investors, that business will continue to grow; in 
addition to
 
the fact, obviously, we're putting more product through the 
pipeline by putting more banking and lending products through. So, yes.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with 
Guggenheim. Your line is open.
 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
Guggenheim Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks ver
y much for taking my question. I just want to understand, 
specifically within FIC as it relates to your broader guidance, would the 
business have been profitable at the current run rate of revenues given the 
expense reduction? And at the projected level of
 
capital extraction, would it 
achieve the 9% to 11% ROE targets?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Again, the ROE targets are for the firm 

 
for all of our capital and, as we've 
mentioned in the past, we are clearly tryin
g to drive improved profitability in 
that business by maintaining the revenues, reducing the capital and reducing 
the costs.
 
Eric Wasserstrom 
-
 
Guggenheim Securities LLC
 
But in terms of sort of the level of run rate revenues to achieve profitability, 
was t
hat accomplished?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
We laid out a plan just this past January that said we were going to try to 
maintain the revenue footprint that we've seen in the past, reduce the 
capital intensity and 
reduce the costs. So we're looking to improve the 
velocity and the consistency of those results.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo 
Securities. Your 
line is open.
 
Matthew Hart Burnell 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities LLC
 
Good morning, thanks for taking my question. First, a quick one. Jon, at 
what point this quarter, if at all, did you all think about utilizing the de 
minimis exception to potentially increase 
your buybacks this quarter since 
they've been pretty steady at the $625 million level over the course of this 
current CCAR cycle?
 
James Patrick Gorman 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We didn't. We chose not to exercise it, because we're more 
focused on the 
annual CCAR cycle. The first time we exercised it was the first time we put 
our toe in the water to do a capital buyback several years ago. Obviously, 
we reserve the right at any point in the future, but this time we were 
focused on getting 
the CCAR plan in.
 
Matthew Hart Burnell 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities LLC
 
Okay, makes sense. And then, secondarily, quickly, in terms of the 
somewhat lower revenue run rate in terms of the 

 
within Wealth 
Management for the revenues per FA, those have been runni
ng at around 
$920 million a quarter. If that level stays and you don't really get much of a 
bounce back, does that imply much meaningful reduction in terms of head 
count in that business as well?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice P
resident
 
Again, that's just a function of sort of the client assets are down given the 
volatility in the market. The number of FAs is pretty stable. We've been 
investing in that business and recruiting. We would like to continue to keep 
that business at ro
ughly that size, and that's just a numerator
-
denominator 
dynamic.
 
Matthew Hart Burnell

Wells Fargo Securities LLC
 
Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with 
Buckingham 
Research. Your line is open.
 
James F. Mitchell

The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
 
Hey. Good morning. Jon, maybe just a quick follow
-
up on energy, can you 
give us the details on what's funded, unfunded, what's non
-
investment 
grade or anything else? I thi
nk last quarter you also discussed what the E&P 
exposure was, can you give us some of those more details?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I'll try to do this very quickly in the interest of time. So, the $14.8 billion i
n 
total funded and unfunded, the numbers haven't changed dramatically, 60% 
investment grade, about 30% drawn, E&P, same thing, about $4.1 billion, 
about $1.8 billion drawn. Mostly 

 
virtually all to non
-
investment grade, and 
then the $2.3 billion of undraw
n is predominantly to investment grade.
 
James F. Mitchell

The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
 
Okay. That's all I have got. Thanks.

Thank you. Our last questio
n comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with 
JPMorgan. Your line is open.
 
Kian Abouhossein

JPMorgan Securities Plc
 
Quick question on the cost side. Your comp level in the IB has been quite 
well managed, year
-
on
-
year down 32%. Just wondering if you coul
d discuss 
a little bit how it relates to the sale of the business, deferred reduction exit 
or comp reduction 

 
real comp reduction and the streamlining business or 
streamlining operation. Just trying to understand better how we should think 
about the run r
ate of the cost line with this Streamline Project coming on.
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Again, I think we made nice progress here early. The Streamline initiatives 
are really sort of towards the back
-
end of this ye
ar and next year, because 
they're more structural and fundamental in nature. That's how I'd try to 
address that.
 
Kian Abouhossein 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities Plc
 
So it's all related to the commodity exit part then?
 
Jonathan Pruzan 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Exe
cutive Vice President
 
No, no. I'm sorry. No. It's definitely not related to the commodity. This is 
broad
-
based savings across the businesses and this initiative is firm
-
wide.
 
Kian Abouhossein 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities Plc
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Jonathan Pruzan

7/22/11,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During 
today's presentation, we'll be referring to our earnings release, financial 
supplement, and strategic update. Copies of which are available

and non

update. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2018 
was a great year that finished on a disappointing note. For the first nine 
months, Morgan Stanley performed strongly. That translated into full year 
resul
ts that included record revenues, record pretax profit and record net 
earnings. Some of those results are listed on slide three and are worth 
noting.
 
That said, the last six weeks of the year in particular were obviously difficult. 
That combined with some 
idiosyncratic items that we'll go through produced 
a below target ROE of 7.7% for the fourth quarter. In a moment, Jon will 
take you through the details of the quarter. Importantly, we do not believe 
the fourth quarter is a new normal. In fact, while it's 
early days, the first 
quarter has started on a similar path to the start of the first quarter of 2018.
 
Now, let me transition and take you through our strategic update 
presentation so you can get a clearer sense of our direction, performance 
objectives, an
d specific action steps. To start, let's review 2018 against our 
2018
-
2019 objectives. So, please turn to slide four. As you can see on the 
right hand side, our results are generally in line with our target ranges. 
Regarding Investment Management, it's fai
r to say we are positioning the 
business for growth, but it's still early days.
 
On capital return, we increased our dividend to $0.30 per share and had a 
buyback of $4.9 billion. The results of 2018 CCAR translated into a flat total 
capital distribution to
 
2017 CCAR, a position we believe we can improve 
upon going forward.
 
Moving to slide five, stability is critical when markets are volatile. When we 
look to reshape Morgan Stanley, our objective was to shift the firm towards 
more relatively stable sources o
f revenue.
 
In our view, relatively stable sources of revenue represent those associated 
with fee
-
based pricing arrangements, financing, and lending. These are 
streams that have generally less susceptible to significant variation when 
faced with market vola
tility. The results of these efforts are apparent. By 
design, the increased contribution to firm
-
wide revenues from these sources 
should help support a base level of profitability during periods of extended 
market disruption.
 
As shown on slide six, capital
 
actions have allowed us to improve our 
dividend and reduced our share count. Our returns are now exceeding our 
cost of capital and we continue to have a sufficient capital base. In the 
future, subject to regulatory approval, we expect to increase our capi
tal 
return while simultaneously investing in our business for growth.
 
Slide seven outlines some of our growth objectives. Our dual mission is to 
drive growth and further enhance the stability of our business.
 
If you turn to slide eight, please. From an ins
titutional perspective, we are 
happy with our footprint and we'll continue to invest in product and 
geographic offerings that support our client base.
 
Our competitive position is strong and we're confident in our ability to 
capitalize on opportunities. We 
believe that the stability of our team and 
business model compared to an industry, much of which is still going 
through change, should enable us to continue to take market share.
 
Moving to slide nine, while the strength of the U.S. economy has been the 
pri
mary driver of global growth over the last several years, we expect Asia 
to play a greater role in the next decade. Our existing strong footprint in 
Institutional Securities, coupled with our growth initiatives, will position us to 
capitalize on this expec
ted regional growth and wealth creation, particularly 
as capital markets become a more important source of financing.
 
Over time, we expect to move to a majority ownership position of our 
securities joint venture in China. A global corporation of our size s
hould be 
able to control its own destiny.
 
On slide 10, as we think about growth in Asia, we shouldn't lose focus of 
Japan, the world's third
-
largest economy. We've had a unique partnership 
with MUFG for almost nine years. As a result, our joint venture has
 
the 
second largest share in that market.
 
Further, our partnership has enabled us to provide material financing for 
clients globally, bringing each of our firm's balance sheet to bear. We work 
together in over 600 transactions.
 
Now, shifting the wealth man
agement on slide 11. We have long discussed 
the relative stability of this revenue base. Scale advantages don't improve 
the story, resulting in a material increase in average sale in revenues over 
time.
 
Looking to the left hand of the slide, on an average 
basis, 91% of trading 
days in 2018 saw revenues above $60 million compared to 81% of trading 
days being below that same threshold in just 2013.
 
Higher average daily revenues, supported by scale and the added benefit of 
U.S. tax reform, have improved the se
gment's contribution to the firm's net 
income. The ROE of that business almost doubled to 20% over the last six 
years.
 
On slide 12, the industry has experienced a secular shift away from 
transactional towards advisory accounts with serve as fee
-
based asset
s. 
We've witnessed a meaningful increase in the allocation of assets towards 
advisory and expect this trend to continue in the medium term, albeit, of 
course, at a slower pace. This shift has reduced our reliance on transactional 
revenue.
 
Over time, we bel
ieve over half of total client assets will be in advisory. As 
shown on the right
-
hand side of the slide, the pool of advisory assets is well 
diversified. While we're not immune to market downturns, portfolio 
diversification should help smooth performance o
ver time as all asset classes 
generally do not move in tandem.
 
Slide 13 outlines the evolution of our investments into Wealth Management. 
While we recognize that many of our clients split their wealth amongst 
several different firms, the technology we have
 
developed creates a 
compelling rationale for clients to consolidate assets with us.
 
We believe this 
--
 
we consider this consolidation to be a meaningful growth 
opportunity going forward. Notably, we've been able to invest in these 
capabilities while conti
nuing to grow our pretax margin, our pretax income, 
and expand our margin.
 
The trade
-
off between revenue growth and margin expansion is important. 
This year, we would be more interested in driving higher revenue growth 
within this margin range that we've b
een public on to necessarily exceed the 
[audio gap]. Many of you have seen our new technology capabilities, which 
we believe will elevate our offering.
 
We plan to further enhance our digital tools as we expand and leverage our 
Stock Plan channel to convert
 
more leads into new clients. We expect this 
channel to provide us with another opportunity for growth over the medium 
term.
 
Additionally, we're open to acquisitions. These types of additions could 
enable us to pursue new client segments through alternativ
e channels or 
accelerate our growth efforts in our core channel.
 
Now moving to slide 14. The U.S. Bank has afforded us the ability to further 
provide services to our client base, both in Wealth Management and 
Institutional Securities. As 
illustrated on this page, we continue to increase 
our high
-
quality lending book.
 
In Wealth, we moved our mortgage origination platform in
-
house this year 
and while we intentionally slowed production temporarily to ensure a 
successful transition, we now hav
e full control of the product's quality and 
customer experience. We expect to increase our mortgage penetration and 
have a strong footing in securities
-
based lending products with our clients.
 
Within the Institutional business, while we're cognizant of the
 
risk in the 
market, including commercial real estate, we have a diversified portfolio that 
is well
-
structured and secured. As always, we aim to maintain a high
-
quality 
book of secured loans and maintain strong velocity of balance sheet.
 
Shifting the page 
to Investment Management, as we noted last year, 
Investment Management is a business positioned for growth and we're 
executing on that opportunity as evidenced by strong growth in our asset 
management fees since we refocused our efforts on Investment 
Manag
ement in late 2015.
 
Across our business lines, we're seeing strong investment performance while 
managing client partnerships and distribution and continued product 
innovation. The focus remains on these drivers to continue our organic 
growth. A key part of
 
the strategy also includes inorganic growth, driven by 
new talent, team lift
-
outs, and acquisitions in areas we believe we can 
deliver differentiated value to our clients.
 
Taken as a whole, slide 16 illustrates the operating leverage of this 
institution. 
Expense management is absolutely necessary in this industry 
given the volatility of revenues. We will continue to focus on driving further 
operating leverage and increase expense management.
 
Please turn to slide 17. Last year, we established clear strategi
c objectives 
for 2018 and 2019, all of which we met, or were in the range of, during the 
full year 2018. Within the year, we saw patches of over
-
performance as well 
as underperformance, obviously, in the fourth quarter. The net result of an 
11.5% ROE, excl
uding intermittent discrete tax items, demonstrates that 
we're on the right track.
 
Notwithstanding 2018 finishing as it did, we maintain our ROE and ROTCE 
target ranges for 2019 and continue to believe the business is well 
positioned to meet those goals.
 
R
egarding our Wealth Management objective, in constructive markets, the 
Wealth Management pretax margin of 28% is not a limit. Our margin will be 
a function of the market and the choices we make on when and how to 
invest for growth.
 
That said, as I said ear
lier, it doesn't serve us well to only focus on margin. 
We are very focused on absolute PBT growth. Additionally, we will utilize our 
capital base to support organic and inorganic business initiatives.
 
For the first time since the financial crisis and the 
acquisition of Smith 
Barney, we bought a business in 2018, Mesa West, a small business but a 
test to find the right way to complement what we're doing in Investment 
Management. The transaction was successful and the ease of integration 
exceeded our expecta
tions. We will be looking for similar bolt
-
on acquisitions 
within both our Wealth and Investment Management businesses.
 
Lastly, while not a point of growth, we reiterate that given our business mix 
and model and our capital base, we will look to achieve 10
0% payout ratio 
going forward, subject obviously, to regulatory approval and any acquisition 
opportunities that may come our way.
 
Our management team remains committed to executing on our long
-
term 
strategy and fulfilling our strategic objectives. We are c
onfident in this 
institution's ability to deliver both future profitability and performance at the 
levels that we've outlined.
 
I'm going to now turn the call over to Jon, who will talk about the fourth 
quarter in detail, the annual results, and then, of co
urse, we'll take your 
questions.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you and good morning. The fourth quarter was difficult. While the 
quarter started off well, during the second half, we saw a pickup in volatility 
and sharp corrections across asset classes.
 
Intraday an
d intraweek volatility impacted the underwriting calendar and 
challenged our market
-
making businesses. Against this backdrop, we 
reported revenues of $8.5 billion and PBT of $1.9 billion. EPS was $0.80, 
ROE was 7.7%, and ROTCE was 8.8%.
 
In addition to the 
challenging market dynamics, factors specific to Morgan 
Stanley further impacted quarterly results. Namely, sharp losses to the 
investments associated with employee deferred compensation plans had a 
considerable impact on transactional revenues in Wealth M
anagement.
 
Additionally, we made slight modifications to the firm's incentive 
compensation, subject to deferral schedules in order to bring them more in 
line with peers. Although these factors are not material to the annual 
results, adjustments can be ampl
ified in any given quarter and impact the 
segments in slightly different ways.
 
Now, to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities business reported 
revenues of $3.8 billion in the quarter, a 22% sequential decline. Sales and 
trading and underwriting resu
lts were both impacted by violent market 
swings at the end of the year. We saw clients de
-
risk and delever in the 
second half of the quarter.
 
Advisory, however, remained strong and we had our best quarterly results in 
over 10 years. For the full year, ISG 
revenues increased 9% to $20.6 billion. 
This represents the seventh consecutive year of growth ex DVA, 
underscoring the power of this franchise. Non
-
compensation expenses of 
$1.9 billion increased 8% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by 
execution
-
related costs and seasonality.
 
While the difficult backdrop weighed on market
-
making, client activity 
remained robust. These flows had commensurate transaction
-
related 
expenses. The compensation ratio for the quarter and full year was 
approximately 31% and
 
34% respectively.
 
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion declined modestly from the 
prior quarter, consistent with lower industry volumes. Strength in advisory 
was offset by declines in underwriting, particularly in the weeks following 
Thanksgiving.
 
Full year Investment Banking revenues of $6.1 billion increased 10% and 
are the highest on record. Advisory revenues increased 44% versus the third 
quarter. Full year advisory revenues of $2.4 billion are the second highest 
ever.
 
Sequentially, equity and d
ebt underwriting revenue saw declines, consistent 
with lower new issue volumes in both products. On a full year basis, we had 
our best year of underwriting revenues at $3.7 billion as the equity product 
had its best year in a decade.
 
Overall, the Investmen
t Banking pipelines and backlogs remain healthy and 
comparable to the same time last year. That said, persistent volatility and 
changes to sentiment could impact our ability to bring transactions to 
market.
 
In equities, the business performed well. Revenue
s declined 4% on a 
sequential basis to $1.9 billion. Volatile market conditions, including the 
severity of intraday and intraweek movements, impacted performance in 
cash and derivatives in the fourth quarter.
 
In prime brokerage, results remained strong. Wh
ile balances declined, 
revenues were supported by strong transactional activity in the first half of 
the quarter. For the full year, equities revenues were the strongest in over a 
decade, increasing 12% to $9 billion. We expect to retain our leadership 
pos
ition and finish number one globally for the fifth consecutive year.
 
Fixed income results for the quarter were weak against a challenging market 
backdrop. Fourth quarter revenues were $564 million. The weakness was 
driven by both credit and macro.
 
Both 
seasonal factors and increased economic uncertainty related to growth 
and rate outlooks for 2019 and beyond influenced markets, resulting in rapid 
movements in spreads and asset prices. Credit was impacted by significant 
widening of spreads towards the end
 
of the year.
 
Macro results were also disappointing, as a breakdown in historical 
relationships weighed on revenues. In both cases, unfavorable market 
conditions resulted in losses as we supported our clients.
 
While commodities represents a smaller part of
 
our fixed income footprint, 
the segment performed well on the back of strong client activity. We 
restructured fixed income over three years ago, and since 2016, the wallet 
has shrunk by over 10%.
 
Despite this market dynamic, we have produced approximately
 
$5 billion of 
revenue each year and gained market share. We are critically and credibly 
sized for the opportunity and are well
-
positioned to continue to support our 
clients.
 
Wealth Management finished a strong year on a weak note, impacted by the 
decline 
in asset prices and the impact of market volatility on investment 
banking revenues. Overall segment revenues were $4.1 billion for the 
quarter.
 
Over the last several years, the impacts from our employee deferred 
compensation plans have had limited impact o
n both revenues and pretax 
margin, but this quarter, losses on deferred compensation plan investments 
had an outsized impact of over 5% to the revenue line. Fourth quarter 
revenues, including revenue impacts of DCP for all periods, were in line with 
both t
hird quarter 2018 and fourth quarter 2017.
 
Full year results highlight the business' operating leverage. Year
-
over
-
year 
revenues, excluding the DCP revenue impacts, grew approximately 5%. By 
comparison, total non
-
compensation expenses grew only 1%. The gro
wth in 
annual revenues and the limited increase to non
-
comp expenses while still 
investing in the platform highlight the business' extraordinary benefit of 
scale.
 
The PBT margin was 24.4% for the quarter. The margin was impacted by the 
difficult environmen
t, increased seasonal expenses, the adjustments to the 
deferral schedule of discretionary incentive compensation, and the impacts 
of DCP.
 
Absent these impacts, the margin would have been more in line with our 
annual results. For the full year, Wealth Manag
ement produced a PBT margin 
of 26.2%. Transactional revenues were $422 million, down $276 million 
sequentially. The DCP impacts accounted for more than the sequential 
decline.
 
Asset Management revenues were unchanged versus the prior quarter. 
Higher asset 
levels at the end of the third quarter helped insulate these 
revenues against the market decline in the fourth quarter.
 
However, not all assets are priced in the beginning of the quarter. And on a 
full year basis, Asset Management revenues increased 9%, a 
function of 
higher fee
-
based client assets driven by markets and flows.
 
Total client assets of $2.3 trillion in the fourth quarter decreased 8% 
sequentially, reflective of broader market movements. We continue to see 
positive fee
-
based asset flows, with fe
e
-
based assets now representing 45% 
of total client assets.
 
Total U.S. Bank deposits of $187 billion increased 7% versus the third 
quarter, driven by higher deposit sweep balances. In particular, our bank 
deposit program benefited from seasonality and clie
nts holding more cash in 
the face of volatile markets.
 
Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 2% versus the prior quarter and 
4% over the full year. We expect 2019 annual NII growth to be in line with 
the loan growth.
 
Given the number of factors tha
t can distort any individual quarter, we 
continue to manage this business with a long
-
term lens. Key indicators of 
the business' strength remain intact. Increased lending penetration, the 
adoption of digital tools, fee
-
based asset flows, and minimal attrit
ion indicate 
an engaged financial adviser population and a business positioned to grow. 
We would expect the margin to rebound in the first quarter, and we are 
confident in our ability to deliver our 26% to 28% margin objective in 2019.
 
Investment Managemen
t reported revenues of $684 million, a 5% increase 
sequentially. For the full year, revenues of $2.7 billion were up 6%.
 
Asset management fees of $628 million grew 4% versus the third quarter, 
driven by a significant amount of the year's performance fees b
eing 
recognized in the fourth quarter. This increase was a result of the revenue 
recognition accounting rule change implemented early this year. The 
increase was partially offset by declines in management fees, which were 
impacted by lower average AUM. On 
a full year basis, asset management 
fees increased a very healthy 12%, reaching $2.5 billion.
 
Investment revenues increased on a sequential basis, primarily driven by 
our private investments within our funds. As we have previously said, this 
line has the p
otential to be lumpy, though we continue to see broad
-
based 
gains in our private alternative strategies. Other revenues were impacted by 
an impairment of a legacy, non
-
controlling interest in a third
-
party asset 
manager.
 
In 2018, we integrated our first ac
quisition, had positive annual long term 
flows and a very strong fundraising year, underscoring the health of our 
franchise. We continue to look for organic and inorganic opportunities to 
grow this business.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential ba
sis, total spot assets of $854 
billion were down from $866 billion on the back of lower client balances and 
inventory. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 26 
million shares or $1.2 billion of common stock and our Board declared a 
$0.30 
dividend per share.
 
Our tax rates for the quarter and full year were 22.1% and 22.7% 
respectively, excluding $111 million and $203 million of intermittent tax 
discrete benefits in the relevant periods. We expect a similar tax rate in 
2019.
 
Turning to the o
utlook, we recognize that the environment has become more 
uncertain than last year. Despite the potential for varying backdrops, we're 
confident in our ability to execute on our stated strategic objectives.
 
While we cannot predict how these dynamics will u
nfold in 2019, we're 
focused on growing and supporting our clients and are prepared to respond 
to market environments with appropriate actions.
 
Although the asset pricing witnessed at the end of the year will have an 
impact on first quarter results, market
s have settled into tighter ranges and 
historical relationships that broke down in the fourth quarter have realigned. 
The market backdrop we saw in November and December has been replaced 
by a clearly more constructive tone.
 
With that, we will now open the
 
line to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
 
Our first question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Your line 
is open.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
The 
first question I wanted to ask was just 
--
 
I recognize that, in Wealth 
Management, there were some moving parts that had to do with two 
different deferred comp programs, one being the one that affects both the 
expense and the revenue lines equally, and we'
ve seen that before. But it 
appears that there was another one that had a onetime impact on costs. And 
I was hoping that you could tease out for us more the numerical impacts of 
both of those and maybe a more fulsome explanation of the one
-
time 
element wit
h respect to deferred comp just so we can understand it better.
 
James Gorman
 
Maybe I'll talk about the 
--
 
what was behind the philosophy and then Jon 
can tell you whatever he can tell you about the numerical aspects of it. 
We've had, I would say, a very ag
gressive deferral program for a number of 
years. Back several years ago, we just thought it was a little over the top 
and we were pushing too much 
--
 
frankly, too much revenue into future 
years, which is mortgaging your future and not healthy. And we adjus
ted 
that one time.
 
In the last couple of years, with particularly our more junior employees at 
the sort of associate VP level, if you looked at where they were deferred 
relative to The Street, they were clearly an outlier. And these are young 
folks and tha
t just didn't feel appropriate.
 
We made those changes, it affected obviously 
--
 
just given the mix of our 
business and the compensation mix; it affects the institutional business in 
aggregate more than it does the other businesses just because it's a much 
bigger with the bonus pool. But it also affects anybody who's at those more 
junior levels across the Board.
 
And the 
--
 
so we made that adjustment. It obviously brings up your comp 
expense and affects the 
--
 
and given that's an adjustment for the full year,
 
the fact is hits in one quarter affects that quarter disproportionately.
 
So, the sort of business rationale for employees and being appropriately 
placed in the market for the younger folks makes a lot of sense. It helps 
with attrition. Clearly, it has an 
impact, not life
-
changing, but that has an 
impact on a business where one point of margin is $40 million, $45 million. 
It has an impact on a business of that kind.
 
On the other side of it, it's bringing compensation this year, not next year 
and the year af
ter. So, it has the other side of the equation, too. So, that 
was the rationale behind it, Guy.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Thanks. And just in terms of the numerical impact?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, I'll try 
--
 
there were two separate impacts. One was the DCP. So, the 
d
eferred cash that our employees invest while they wait until it vests. That 
had the significant impact on the revenues that I mentioned, over 5% in the 
quarter. That had a more limited impact on the PBT. And again, over a long 
period of time 
--
 
excuse me, 
over the annual basis, the deferred comp plans 
have generally been pretty 
--
 
have not really impacted the PBT, but we did 
obviously see a 14% decrease in the S&P in the quarter.
 
And within Wealth, based on the mix of how those employees invest their 
assets
 
and the deferral schedules, you saw a bigger revenue impact there. 
On the one
-
time change and the adjustment, as James said, it's magnified 
because of the quarter. In any one quarter 
--
 
and I would 
--
 
as I mentioned 
in my script, if you take those as well
 
as the seasonality as well as some of 
the volatility we saw in the Investment Banking or I guess, in the calendar 
revenue, which you can see in the supplement, the margin would have been 
closer to the full year margin, had those impacts not occurred.
 
Oper
ator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. 
Your line is open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thanks very much. Just looking for a little color on the inorganic potential 
in Investment Management. I think we all know the tough world and 
backdrop on the traditional side of the business. We know that Morgan 
Stanley sold the retail component of its business and the alternative world is 
growing.
 
So, you gave us a look on check mark in each asset class. But can we 
sharpen that a little 
--
 
focu
s a little bit more and say why now? What 
particular focus? And then maybe how you think about investing in that 
business versus say buying back stock at book value?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. I mean, if the stock stays at 
--
 
if the stock's at $42 or whatever it is
 
going to open up this morning, that's a 
--
 
I kind of like buying that all day 
long, to be blunt. So, yes, I do but I'm trying to think a little longer than 
what's going on today and tomorrow.
 
Listen, the Investment Management platform is very interesting.
 
We are 
--
 
I 
think as the slide shows, we have a very good long
-
only business. Dennis 
Lynch has been number one Morningstar. So, I think two of the last four 
years has had great flows and we've had 
--
 
we've got a great deep value 
team led by William Lock i
n London and a bunch of other teams. So, we 
have a very strong performance in that business. We had very good flows 
into managed equities, which is 
--
 
and obviously, The Street did not 
experience that, so that's a positive.
 
Our fixed income 
business has typically been a small 
--
 
not typically, it is 
smaller than we would like. It's more of a scale
-
driven business, as you 
know. So, I see opportunities where if we could build out and acquire teams 
and/or small add
-
on firms to build out the equi
ty or the fixed income side 
that would be very interesting. Put liquidity aside for a minute.
 
In the Alternatives space, and that's where we did the commercial real 
estate transaction with Mesa West, the California firm. We give them global 
reach. I think 
that integration has gone really well. That was sort of our little 
test tube, getting our foot back in the water. I think it was a couple of 
hundred million dollars, just to get a sense of it. And I think that's going 
great.
 
And those 
--
 
so whether it's ac
ross that real estate platform, our private 
equity platform, our Asia PE platform, our mezzanine platform, the 
infrastructure funds, we've now got two $4 billion infrastructure funds, the 
real estate business has bounced back, there are a lot of spaces, Gl
enn, 
where we can add on.
 
Now, we're not suggesting we're about to do a megadeal in Asset 
Management and you and I and everybody else knows those are complicated 
and not all of those have been successful over time. But what we are 
focused on is 
--
 
we're fo
rtunate to have a platform that plays in pretty much 
every space, including, by the way, fund of funds, which I didn't mention. 
We have real estate and private equity fund of funds, hedge fund fund of 
funds.
 
So, we plan all of those, and if we can drop in 
a series of 
--
 
sort of string
-
of
-
pearl type acquisitions across the platform while we're driving organic 
growth in the actively managed, which is the higher margin business, get 
better scale in the fixed income platform and do this over a period of years 
a
nd not look for a single answer but a series of answers, I think there's a lot 
of space in there. And I think Dan and his team 
--
 
I was over there a couple 
of days ago with the team and I think they're 
--
 
they've got the program 
working well.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Appreciate that. A quickie on trading. I heard all your comments on equities, 
but 
--
 
I know we won't get numbers, but in general, could we 
--
 
could you 
comment on like how much client deleveraging and lower volumes impacts 
things versus trying to stand up 
and facilitate for clients and just taking 
some hits along the way when the market is falling like a rock?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think that was a good characterization. First of all, that business performed 
extraordinarily well we'll be number one. Again, for 
the fifth consecutive 
year, we maintained our leading share in a market that grew probably about 
10%. So, it was a good overall year.
 
Clearly, cash and derivatives were impacted by that volatility. PB hung in 
there. We did see deleveraging. It came down pr
etty dramatically in the 
fourth quarter. We've seen a little bit, probably a couple of points of gross 
balances coming back, but certainly not back to the levels of October. And 
again, the tone is more constructive here in the first couple of weeks, but 
th
e impacts around the equities was really around the cash and the 
derivatives.
 
James Gorman
 
Although I think he's also asking about, in the fixed income side, when we 
stood by our clients on the
--
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Absolutely, sorry. Yes, so in FID, we clearl
y saw a much more difficult 
market. It was a one
-
way market. We stood to support our clients. It was 
tough client flow, and we really saw that both across 
--
 
really, in the macro 
space, the credit clearly impacted by the widening spreads. But we had good 
c
lient activity and we supported our clients.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your 
line is open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. You guys referred to this a 
couple of times, and James, 
I believe you referenced how you all made a 
change to the deferral schedule for comp a few years ago, which was also to 
bring in line with peers.
 
So, my question is what 
--
 
you made reference to the fact that it was the 
junior level, but what processes all
owed the drift away from the competitive 
set over these past few years? And what steps are you putting in place so 
that we can all rest assured we're not going to see a three
-
peat of this 
event?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. I think, Brennan, that's a fair question, b
ut to be totally clear, I mean, 
the change we made several years ago was a big deal. I mean, that was a 
multibillion
-
dollar event. And that was 
--
 
I went to the Board and just said, 
we are pushing way too much compensation into future years. And we are 
mor
tgaging the future and I just don't think that's a good way to run a 
railroad.
 
You've 
--
 
yes, we want to defer comp because we want people to live with 
their actions when they're at this firm. And at the most senior levels, 
obviously myself, we defer most 
of it and we do that willingly. And 
--
 
but we 
didn't actually get the bottom end of the tables right if you looked at it. And 
we were at the outer ends for sort of the associate, VP, and junior ED levels 
and these are regarded sort of good housekeeping.
 
I 
have zero intention of a three
-
peat. There will not be a three
-
peat. We've 
done zero house 
--
 
we've done some housekeeping here. I think it was 
smart to do. And I wouldn't make a meal out of this. It's just something that 
given obviously the disappointing 
sort of sticker at a price numbers of some 
of this stuff; it affects things like the margin in Wealth Management 
because, as I said, $40 million, $45 million is a point of margin. If you 
change some of the comp and put it in this year and you do it all in 
one 
quarter, it affects that margin for that quarter. But I'm not 
--
 
I'm just not 
that 
--
 
I'm not that wound up about it, honestly. And certainly, there is 
--
 
to 
your core question, we are not going to be doing a three
-
peat on this. This 
was just a cleanup
.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. Thank you. And then you guys commented on how we are 
--
 
the first 
quarter is off to a better start. Probably, we're going to see a lot more 
elasticity in revenues bouncing back in the Securities business. Curious if 
you can provide u
s some insights and share some perspectives on what you 
saw in Wealth. When you see several months of sequential declines in the 
markets that are particularly pronounced, there could be some shaking of 
confidence, which tends not to rebound as fast as mark
ets might. Is that 
what we should also expect in Wealth? Might there be a little bit of a slower 
lift in that business? Or are you seeing some meaningful amount of the 
Wealth clients reengage or many of them that did not pull back in the fourth 
quarter? Th
anks.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, Brennan, good question. There are three or four things that can affect 
the Wealth business in difficult times of stress. One is advisers. Do they stay 
or leave? Attrition is extremely low, so that's not an issue. And I think, 
frankl
y, our adviser force, they like working at Morgan Stanley. The 
platform, the support, the brand, the stability of the firm, these are very 
positive. So, that's number one.
 
Number two, did clients pull assets out during the financial crisis? I think we 
lost
 
2.5% of our client assets during the financial crisis. So 
--
 
and that was, 
obviously, a very, very, very different world from what we've been in with a 
little market turmoil here. So, no, there's no issue there.
 
The third is, did clients move more 
money into cash? The answer to that is 
absolutely. You saw our deposit numbers go up. Our cash levels are 
--
 
I 
don't want to say at historic highs, but they're 
--
 
because I frankly don't 
have the full history, but as long as I've been doing this business, 
which is 
almost 30 years, these cash levels are high. And people that's sitting on the 
sidelines, they've had a lot of anxiety served up to them in the last year, not 
just consensus about the economy but political anxiety and all of the other 
stuff going o
n around the world. So, yes, high cash levels.
 
Do I expect clients to reengage if things stabilized? Absolutely. Part of 
reengaging is having products to buy, so new issue coming to market, the 
banking calendar being a positive. Clients see something that'
s attractive out 
there to participate in and they start getting moving, and the advisers are 
calling them.
 
So, I don't see 
--
 
again, I've been doing this a very long time and this is not 
a period where I would say you're seeing any fundamental shift in cli
ent 
attitude or confidence. You definitely have a very low level of transaction, 
which we've had for two years, and it's got increasingly lower and even 
pushed into more money being cash through the fourth quarter. That could 
stay as is. It can't go much l
ower just given where transaction revenues are, 
frankly.
 
I probably have a bias in 2019 that you'd see some rebound on that. I don't 
think you're going to 
--
 
we're not talking bull market rebound obviously, but 
I think you'd see some modest rebound in tran
saction activity. And as the 
calendar picks up, you also have the new issue starting to kick in.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your 
line is open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi, can you hear me?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, good morning M
ike.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Hey Mike.
 
Mike Mayo
 
I'm struggling with the quarter understanding exactly what happens, so I'm 
just going to kind of ask point blank. On the one hand, you can say, this is 
Morgan Stanley acting conservatively, scrubbing the balance she
et, 
housekeeping, new comp program.
 
On the other hand, it could be Morgan Stanley of old, where you had hiccups 
in Fixed Income like the second half of 2015 or 2013 or during the financial 
crisis. So, my question is, how much of this quarter, the fourth qu
arter 
--
 
I 
get you got your targets for the year, but I'm really talking about the fourth 
quarter. How much of this quarter is due to scrubbing the balance sheet and 
housekeeping and how much is due to execution falling short of what you 
wanted?
 
And what w
ould be helpful there is 
--
 
so for the macro, fixed income the 
$500 million, that's half your target per quarter. How much of that was due 
to markdowns versus sales? And when it came to housekeeping, I guess 
were estimating $150 million impact due to the c
hange in compensation. If 
you could give a specific number that was in response to Guy's question, 
too. Thanks.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. Well, listen, I'll have a go at it, and I'm sure Jon will add in. And it's a 
good question, Mike. I don't really see it. I cer
tainly don't see it as the B, 
which is the Morgan Stanley of old, if you will, the sort of episodic volatile 
shifts, overdependence on propositions, big marks, misplaced trades, major 
integrations going on at the same time, selling businesses, writing stuf
f off. 
It's not that. I mean that's 
--
 
we're not remotely close to that.
 
As to sort of housekeeping, cleaning up, balance sheet management, comp 
plan management, I wouldn't put all of it down to that either. I don't think 
that 
--
 
I think that flatters the 
numbers. That was a factor, as we went 
through, in a whole bunch of areas.
 
But on the business side, fixed income, $500 million is hardly a good 
quarter. That's not a satisfactory result from my perspective. We've talked 
about $1 billion a quarter, on aver
age, and we've repeated on average 
because you can't guarantee it every time. We had I think $1.7 billion in the 
first quarter and $500 million and change in the last quarter, so that's $1.1 
billion just on those two quarters. The year averaged at about $1
 
billion in a 
quarter, but yes 
--
 
no, that was not a good result. And we know that, the 
folks 
--
 
the team knows that and we don't 
--
 
we do not expect that to be 
standard operating procedure. So, on a pure operating basis, that was 
probably the biggest gap 
against our expectations.
 
And the third issue is obviously the market. I mean, clients move money into 
cash in times of distress, new issue gets pushed back, calendar gets pushed 
back. There's 
--
 
there are positions you have where you're supporting clients
 
where you're taking small hits along the way. Some of your hedges don't 
work when all of the assets correlate and move together. I mean there was 
a lot of market activity.
 
So, I would put 
--
 
if you were to put probabilities against each of those three 
cat
egories, I would put 0% against sort of the Morgan Stanley of old 
category. I would put 30%
-
plus, 30%, 40% on the sort of the various one
-
off things we did, cleanups and so on, and 60% of the results reflected what 
was going on in the market. And if you wa
shed all of that out against the 
competitive set, I think you'd find our results probably look much more like 
the competitive set when you normalize that.
 
But again, I'm not 
--
 
we're not being defensive about it. It wasn't the 
quarter we wanted. And we mov
e on to 2019 and we expect, as we said, a 
rebound in important areas. Jon, I don't know if you want to add to it.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. I would just say on the 
--
 
to echo James on the point of the Morgan 
Stanley of old reference. If you think about 
--
 
and I
 
was looking at this the 
other day. A quarter where we put up this type of result in fixed income was 
third quarter of 2015, and in that quarter, we were sub 4% ROE, sub $1 
billion in PBT in Wealth.
 
So, the business is on much stronger footing, where that 
business is smaller 
today than it was and the relative contribution is not as important. It's an 
important business for us. We have confidence in it. As we said, we put up 
$5 billion of revenue in each of the last three years in a shrinking market, so 
it's
 
not the business of old.
 
James Gorman
 
And I mean, we still 
--
 
I mean, just to say it. I think the net for the quarter 
is $1 billion, $1.5 billion, a little under that, I think, roughly. In the bad old 
days, Mike, even absent markets and stuff, we were hap
py to hit $1 billion 
net in our best quarters. And the bad old days were like four years ago, 
three. It wasn't 
--
 
this is a 
--
 
I have similar hair as I have back 
--
 
have now 
back then. So, it was 
--
 
we're not talking the real old days. So, yes 
--
 
no, 
I'm n
ot. This is not that.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Just one follow
-
up. How much of the FICC underperformance was due to 
write
-
downs? And I asked because maybe you get write
-
ups if spreads are 
tightening here.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No, I mean, there was no 
--
 
there wasn't any 
major individual event. As I 
said, we had good client activity, part of facilitating our market
-
making 
businesses standing in between flow. And that flow was tough this quarter.
 
So, there wasn't any individual event, Mike. Obviously, we do have 
inventories
 
and inventories move up and down as markets move up and 
down. So, you'll see some of that in the first quarter.
 
James Gorman
 
We did have a write
-
down of a piece we own in the asset management 
business. We're not going to name it, obviously. But we've 
had some 
investments that were done pre
-
crisis, long, long time ago. And 
unfortunately, we continue to live with those. And they're not frankly that 
significant, but we 
--
 
that was something that went on this quarter.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question 
comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe 
Research. Your line is open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Hey good morning. So wanted to kick things off with a question on the 
Wealth Management margin guidance. Certainly encouraging to hear the 
reaffirmation of the 26% to 28% target
. I'm just wondering, given the 
benefit from the roll
-
off of the legacy Smith Barney contracts, I believe you 
guided to 125 to 150 basis points from that alone, whether that benefit 
--
 
should we expect it to fall to the bottom
-
line or will those proceeds b
e 
reinvested in the business?
 
James Gorman
 
Just 
--
 
again, I think it's important to note, and I'm sure your models do 
this. There's seasonality in that business. So, again, that's a full year 
number. I've no idea what the first quarter is going to look lik
e, but we 
typically have FICO, the social security payments in the first quarter, some 
of that stuff. So, it's the full year number.
 
I think we're 
--
 
you're pointing it out right. I think we just had 
--
 
a couple of 
days ago, somebody sent me a note it was 
the 10th anniversary of the 
announcement of the deal, which was pretty exciting. It was January like 9th 
or 12th or something. And I think those deals, yes, they run off towards the 
end of this month, something like that.
 
So, we'll see some of that has bee
n reinvested and will be reinvested in the 
business, but yes, you'll get some 
--
 
you clearly get some margin 
improvement from that 
--
 
against that. We 
--
 
just to say, at least for this 
quarter, obviously, where assets were priced on the equity side for the
 
quarter was lower than they were in the previous couple of quarters. And 
the equity markets are recovering a bit then, so we'll be doing repricing at 
the end of this quarter.
 
So, they'll 
--
 
I would say there will continue to be some pluses and minuses 
thr
ough the first quarter and then things probably stabilize out a little bit 
more.
 
Steven Chubak
 
And the full year number is
--
?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
And the full year number is 
--
 
yes, we're solid on the full year number.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Got it. And just one follow
-
up on some of the comments relating to how 
clients are managing some of their cash given the sell
-
off in 4Q. You alluded 
to the elevated client cash levels. I could certainly see that in the data, 
James. You're clearly a good student of this business. But
 
just given the 
market pullback at year end and the 7% uptick in deposits, I'm just trying to 
gauge how sticky is that cash, in your mind. Especially as equity markets 
grind higher, do you expect to see some immediate engagement? And how 
does that inform y
our NII guidance for the full year?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
So, you're right, we did see a nice uplift in the deposits. Some of that is 
seasonal, but clearly, some of that was activity driven by asset allocation, as 
we've talked about before. That's sort of the pr
imary driver of what people 
do with their money in our system and we did see people change their 
behavior a bit here, either we saw redemptions in mutual funds going into 
cash and cash
-
like products as well as some of the dividends that they 
received not g
oing back into the market. So, we did see a little bit more of 
the deposits than we had expected.
 
To the degree that those deposits stay in the system for longer, you're right; 
they'll have a positive impact on NII. Either way, I think we're very 
comfortab
le with our guidance that the NII will grow in line with our loan 
growth guidance, which is mid
-
single
-
digits. And I think it's a little too early 
to say how people are going to spend that money. We do typically see 
--
 
start to see some of that money flow 
out for taxes and other purposes. But 
again, it's a little early in the year to predict whether that stays 
--
 
that extra 
deposit stay on, but it would have a positive impact.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Bernstein. 
Y
our line is open.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Good morning. Wanted to spend a bit of time on your Wealth Management 
technology investments. I agree that you got to do some pretty interesting 
stuff, especially around the Aladdin integration, et cetera. But help me 
understand how it translates into improved financial performance. Is it that 
you think it will be hard for peers to replicate so you can build a sustainable 
advantage over time? Or should I think about it some other way?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think there's a c
ouple of ways to think about it on both revenue and 
expenses and also time. A couple of things that will be helpful, I think. 
Again, some of the digital tools go around asset aggregation and risk 
analytics. So that should 
--
 
over time, as adoption accelera
tes and FAs are 
using the product with their clients, should help with the external assets held 
away. So, from a medium to longer term, that should help us acquire more 
of our clients' assets, and we know they have a significant portion of those 
assets hel
d away.
 
That will also help them just with the analytics and our Next Best Action and 
things that we have in that area should help them with their time. We find 
that when the adviser has more time, they have more ability to engage with 
their clients, which
 
is always a positive. And then on the expense side, some 
of the changes that we're making eliminate some of the paper that goes on 
in the offices and whatnot and we'll continue to see efficiencies on the 
expense side because of these investments.
 
James Go
rman
 
We're getting close to the end of the hour. We'll extend this for a little bit, I 
think, just to give everybody a chance to ask more questions because, 
obviously, there's a bunch of stuff people are trying to understand. So, why 
don't we go up to 9:15
?
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. I've got one quickly. On the Stock Plan business, I believe Naureen 
Hassan talked about growing the business like 18 months ago. So, maybe 
help us understand the progress since then, what you've been doing 
differently or more in 2019
 
and beyond to drive further growth.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. So, we've made some really critical hires in that business. We continue 
to transfer our plans on to another technology provider, and that process is 
going. It just kicked off this year. And we woul
d expect that with the new 
focus and the new technology, we should be able to effectively touch more 
of those clients that we have in that space. And again, we think it's a real 
nice opportunity over the medium to longer term to bring in more clients 
and m
ore assets into the business.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is open.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about, kind of broadly 
speaking, expense flexibility if macro 
turns down again. And then, I guess, 
specifically within the Institutional Securities, you've had really nice market 
share gain in the investment bank as well as across the trading businesses 
the past couple of years.
 
And should we think about that as prov
iding more flexibility to cut costs if 
you need? Or are you really mindful about protecting those share gains and 
less flexibility to cut costs than maybe we'd suggest?
 
James Gorman
 
Why don't I start on this and let Jon talk about how to think about the 
In
stitutional Business and expense management versus growth. Firstly, very 
important that we've reiterated our efficiency ratio, which was a 2018
-
2019 
target. We say we'd be at or below 73%. I think we've had 
--
 
I don't know 
how many years we've put efficien
cy ratios in these decks, but certainly 
every other one, if not more often, and I don't think we've missed one yet. 
And last year, we're at 72%.
 
So, again, that's something 
--
 
we focus and we care a lot about expense 
management. Obviously, when you have a 
quarter with 
--
 
the way we had in 
the last quarter and some things going on, you 
--
 
if we thought that was a 
12
-
month event, then we'd have a very different view on the expenses of 
this organization. But you don't want to panic. You don't want to have 
--
 
j
ust 
because you have a quarter and suddenly you start throwing out a whole 
bunch of investments that are important for the growth of this firm. I mean, 
we got to focus on more than just a quarter. We've got a focus on three to 
five
-
year growth, and we plan
t a lot of seeds. We'd like to see them come 
through.
 
Now, all of you know a big part of our expense is compensation. I can 
absolutely promise you, if we have a year of flat to 2018 on revenues, our 
compensation will be down. We paid people well for a reco
rd year this year. 
We 
--
 
they deserve that. They've done a phenomenal job.
 
But the other side of that is we've got to find continued growth. And if we 
don't see that, then, obviously, we find that in the expense line. So, comp is 
a huge part of the expense
 
line. And across this organization, I mean, we're 
in, I don't know, how many countries in the world. We make thousands of 
incremental business decisions that drive expenses every day, and yes, that 
is something we will be hyper focused on as we get throug
h about the first 
half of this quarter and get a better sense of where we think things are 
really heading.
 
But we have an efficiency ratio out there for a reason, and we would do 
everything reasonably within our power to drive to that. Jon, do you want to 
talk about the investment within 
--
 
I mean, we've attracted talent so
--
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. No, again, I think that you mentioned it. We have been gaining market 
share, but we do have flexibility and levers. We implemented the Streamline 
program a couple 
of years ago. That discipline has continued throughout the 
building. We have monthly meetings with all the business heads and all the 
units. People have targets and we're going to continue to be very focused on 
the expenses that we can control. And so ther
e are levers, and if we need to 
use them, we will.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. 
Your line is open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Thanks for that. Good morning. I guess first question here 
just on Brexit and 
the uncertainty that's been increasing over there and just how we should 
think about either risks to Morgan Stanley around potentially personnel 
movements or maybe indirect, just related to kind of how you guys are 
thinking about the out
look for the institutional business given that 
uncertainty is pretty high right now.
 
James Gorman
 
In terms of specific uncertainty to Morgan Stanley in personnel, I wouldn't 
--
 
if I were you, honestly, I wouldn't think about it. It's just 
--
 
that's not in 
my 
top 200 issues today. In terms of the potential for Brexit and the ongoing 
saga in the U.K. Parliament to disrupt the markets, to slow down one of the 
most important economies in the world, the U.K., potentially contribute to a 
further slowdown in Europ
e, that's getting in the top, I don't know, 15 to 20 
issues that I deal with.
 
So, yes, we watch it very carefully, but we're a very global firm with 
resources all over the planet. So, we will manage this. And I think our team 
has done a great job setting u
p for both the expected Brexit outcome, which 
is a sort of soft departure or smooth landing or whatever the language is. 
But if it doesn't happen and we end up with a hard or we end up with no 
Brexit or remain, well, we're ready to deal with that, too.
 
Dev
in Ryan
 
Okay, great. And just a quick follow
-
up here just on Investment Banking. It 
was a light quarter for debt capital markets. I know issuance in the market 
was slow. But are you changing your thinking at all on extending balance 
sheet just with some of
 
the volatility that we've seen recently?
 
And then with that volatility, as we're entering 2019, it will be great to get a 
little bit of perspective around the dialogue with clients, either on the equity 
issuance side, where I think there's been some enthu
siasm around potential 
for IPOs this year and then also on the M&A advisory side as well.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I'll try to take that. In DCM, you're right; it was a tough finish in terms 
of volumes in the year, subdued activity levels. I think it was the 
slowest 
quarter since 2011. And from a high
-
yield perspective, it was the lowest 
since, I think, 2009. So, the volatility really shut down that market in the 
fourth quarter. As spreads widened out a bit, some deals got hung, Europe 
was really challenged. B
ut we have seen that sort of reverse itself, as I think 
I mentioned. The high yield spreads have come in 100 basis points. 
Leveraged loans are back to where they were. There was a handful of deals 
on the road, mostly LBOs that are going well and that marke
t seems to be 
reopening. And so we would expect a continuation of issuance there.
 
On the M&A side, and I've mentioned the pipelines and the backlogs, 
dialogues are good, confidence is high, people are looking for growth, and 
we have good dialogues going on
 
now. You saw some of the announcements 
we made earlier in the year and we continue to be involved in those 
discussions. And we feel good about the pipeline.
 
And then lastly, on the equity product, the one caveat here is the IPO 
product in the U.S. as we n
eed the SEC open to price those deals. We have a 
very strong pipeline and hopefully, this issue gets resolved. Then we'll bring 
those to market as soon as they do.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of 
America Merril
l Lynch. Your line is open.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Thanks guys. Jon, maybe just first question for you. Just in terms of the 
environment, you mentioned getting better in the first quarter. Since some 
of the volatile like line items 
--
 
when I think about the Insti
tutional Business, 
like the other line that credit flows through, investment line that was 
negative and then even the deferred comp, was there anything in the fourth 
quarter that was more like realized losses versus mark to market that if the 
market contin
ues to stabilize, we would expect some normalization there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, I mean 
--
 
again, as you know, most of that inventory is mark
-
to
-
market. And so as markets move up and down, we adjust those valuations. 
We have hedging that goes on that helps
 
protect us from those volatilities.
 
But as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw some things that we 
haven't seen in the past or we haven't 
--
 
some historical relationships broke 
down. There was one item that we'd call out in the press release and the
 
other line around that investment we had in the public security. We still own 
that. It's restricted and so things will move around a little bit.
 
But if you step back even further for the full year, if you put all those lines 
together, 2017 versus 2018; th
ey were pretty much 
--
 
pretty 
--
 
I think the 
Delta was a little under $200 million. So, it wasn't really material, again, 
through the overall year. It does have sometimes outsized impact to the 
quarter though.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay, that's helpful. And then
, James, you mentioned just on the strategic 
review M&A a few times. You hit on it in the investment management 
business. I think you mentioned even in the Wealth and just wanted to get 
their sense. So, that you're seeing more, like innovative opportunitie
s out 
there for acquisitions or is it you also some of the capital has been tied up 
and you haven't been able to maybe pay out as much as you want to? Just 
wanted to get a sense on what's sort of driving more of the M&A comments 
throughout the different bu
sinesses?
 
James Gorman
 
Yes. No, it's a good pickup and it's less the capital issue, frankly. And it's 
more a state of mind here. I don't want to suggest that the markets open up 
or not open up. That's very sort of deal and company
-
specific, but it's more 
o
ur attitude. Our attitude is we have some terrific platforms. We are 
interested in finding ways to penetrate new client groups. And we just want 
to continue to build
-
out and obviously, doing deals in wealth and asset 
management is a completely different ba
ll of wax than doing them in trading 
businesses or in banking businesses.
 
So, the bias is obviously, things that are sort of the scale
-
driven, within our 
wheel house and extend us into better penetration of existing clients or new 
clients. And we think we 
have capacity. Yes 
--
 
no, we're 
--
 
it's a focus. 
Obviously, getting deals done, as you all know, that's you know 
--
 
you can't 
guarantee stuff, but 
--
 
if you 
--
 
I know one thing, if you're not intending to 
do them, you won't do them.

Thank you. Our
 
next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham 
Research. Your line is open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Hey good morning. May be a quick question on capital return. In November, 
Randy Quarles talked about maybe eliminating the leverage ratio in this post 
stress s
cenario. How do you 
--
 
does that change the way to think about 
capital return at all? Or any update on that front in terms of kind of 
discussions with the Fed on what the formal approach might be with respect 
to leverage and the stress tests?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes. Unfortunately, there hasn't been a lot of progress. We do know the SCB 
is going to be delayed and therefore, I think those comments probably tie 
into the SCB and how he thinks about the capital regime going forward.
 
Obviously, 2019 str
ess test, I don't think will be impacted by some of the 
comments that he made in May. We haven't gotten the instructions at the 
scenario yet for the year, but we stand by the comment that we believe we 
have sufficient capital and should be able to return 1
00% of it going forward 
--
 
of the earnings, excuse me, not the capital.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Thanks. And a follow
-
up to on liquidity reserve, I noticed that it did jump 
quite a bit. Just by balance sheet coming down. Is that sort of mechanical 
because of the envir
onment? Or is there something else to read into the 
liquidity reserve jumping so much?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, I mean, there's two components one of the primary drivers is really 
deposits we talked about. We saw about an $8 billion increase in those suite 
dep
osits in the quarter. And then the second is, as client balances came 
down, we, obviously, have liquidity to support those businesses, the 
businesses use less of it.
 
We still hold that liquidity because our expectation is that the businesses will 
use it ag
ain and we 
--
 
as we've talked about a lot, we've dramatically 
changed the structure of our liabilities and the durability of our liabilities and 
therefore, we're sized to support our clients, to use less cash in the quarter 
and we still have it in case the
y want to use it again next quarter or this 
quarter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your 
line is open.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Can you guys give 
us some color? You touched a little bit on the leverage 
loan market. Can you give us some color on your exposure to leverage loans 
and the CLOs? And just what you're seeing in that market may be compared 
to prior time periods where you guys are involved in
 
that business?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. Two separate questions. On the event, there's some disclosure, I think 
in the footnotes that gets you to sort of a single 
--
 
or excuse me, non
-
investment
-
grade exposure. It's been pretty stable over the last 
period of 
time. So, I think going into the quarter, we felt very good with the book that 
we had or the exposures we had. They were well priced, structured.
 

And we feel very good ab
out sort of that book of business and being able to 
bring that to market, assuming these conditions continue to hold.
 
On the CLO front 
--
 
as you know we're an active securitizer. We provide 
warehouse for that business. We like that business. That business 
is 
dramatically different and I think, sometimes confused with the business of 
CDOs and other things years ago.
 
For us, the warehouse business, we've got good equity protection. Usually, 
somewhere in the order of 20%. The collateral is well diversified by 
sector; 
it's not all real estate, which it was back in the day. And so we like that 
business. We didn't see any credit 
--
 
any credit negative in that business this 
quarter. We're actually in the market with the CLO currently, hope to price it 
next week. A 
couple of deals might price next week so that business or that 
market is coming back as well. So, we like that business and it was 
--
 
it's a 
good business for us.
 
Gerard Cassidy
 
Great. And just a quick follow
-
up, Jon. We've talked about this in the past. 
O
bviously, you've had a good institutional penetration in equities. Can you 
give us an update on MiFID II? How you're seeing that play out? What 
benefits you're seeing for your business?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
A couple of things. I would say it's sort of consisten
t with the comments we 
talked about in the past. It probably outperformed our expectations a little 
bit although again our expectations was it wasn't going to have a material 
impact on the business.
 
We've outperformed a little bit. We have seen some consol
idation of 
--
 
or 
how people look at their counter parties and consolidating. We've also seen 
some consolidation in the space as they are less providers. So, not material, 
but probably outperforming what we originally thought and also still pretty 
early and
 
we'll have to see longer there on how impacts.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our last question is from Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Your line is 
open.
 
Alevizos Alevizakos
 
Hi, thank you for taking my question. It's a question on the strategy update 
that you gave. 
Mostly interested about the 
--
 
your kind of confidence that 
you will be able to grow the lending, especially on mortgage business, 
because you're practically going against your peers, that they are closer to 
this kind of market segment. So, I was just wond
ering what makes you that 
comfortable with the 5% loan growth.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, we, obviously, have multiple products, mortgage being one, the 
securities
-
based lending and tailored lending within the wealth segment and 
we continue to see good client 
engagement. The reason we are confident is 
that the last couple of quarters, as we've integrated 
--
 
our excuse me, 
shifted from the old platform we have that a new platform, we seen that 
--
 
those balances grow.
 
Again, the number of applications we have, ob
viously, rates came down a 
little bit. So, refinance activity has been a little bit healthier and we just feel 
that we're underpenetrated with our client base. Our clients like most 
products and we would expect to continue to grow them going forward.

4/25/11,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. I will be reading a statement on behalf of Morgan Stanley.
 
Today's presentation will refer to Morgan Stanley's earnings release and 
financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.
 
Today's presentation may 
include forward
-
looking statements that are 
subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ 
materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward
-
looking statements 
and non
-
GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. T
his 
presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
 
As you all know, over the 
past decade, we've dramatically transformed our 
business model. We've grown the contribution of more durable balance sheet 
light sources of revenue, investing in Wealth Management and Investment 
Management, while maintaining our leadership position and tak
ing share 
across our integrated investment bank.
 
The intention has been to provide stability to our firm in times of serious 
stress and to provide strength and value to our clients in times of volatile 
and active markets.
 
The environment for the second qua
rter provided exactly that test. The 
COVID health crisis, economic collapse, and a tremendous surge in 
unemployment, massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, operating with 90% 
of employees working from home, extraordinary client financing demand, an 
increase
 
in corporate defaults and bankruptcies, and record market volumes.
 
Against this extremely challenging backdrop, I'm very proud of my 
colleagues, the way they manage to support our clients, and risk manage 
massive uncertainty, all while working from home.
 
The results we announced this morning build on a very strong relative 
performance of the first quarter with a record breaking second quarter. 
Revenues of $13.4 billion exceed our best quarter ever by 21%. We 
delivered record net income of $3.3 billion and 
an ROTCE of 18.6% 
excluding a discrete tax item with an expense efficiency ratio of 68%.
 
The stability of our platform in the face of record breaking volumes and a 
surging capital raising from clients was critical. Our revenues of course 
benefited from thi
s record activity. But the ROTCE is the function of very 
strong operating leverage with a high degree of expense discipline in the 
face of significant macro headwinds. As importantly, our credit cards were 
relatively limited.
 
This is by design as we have v
irtually no unsecured consumer loans. We do 
not have significant emerging market exposure and we have modest 
exposure to the Small Business segment.
 
Each of our businesses contributed meaningfully to the results, but the 
standout was Institutional Securiti
es. For the post
-
crisis period, ISG had 
record revenues of $8 billion and record equity underwriting, record debt 
underwriting, record equity sales and trading and record fixed income sales 
and trading. Fixed income in particular was the standout.
 
In Wealt
h Management, despite the impact of rates on net interest income 
and some integration costs relating to E*TRADE, our margin was over 24%. 
We saw clients continue to consolidate assets with our advisors, deposit 
growth and loan growth.
 
Investment Management
 
also performed exceptionally well with record and 
industry
-
leading long
-
term flows as well as growth across all asset classes, 
geographies, and investor segments. Assets now are $665 billion, up from 
approximately $460 billion at the beginning of 2019.
 
So
 
what does the future hold? Clearly, it will be challenging for the back half 
of 2020 to meet the record first half results and we expect advisory and 
macro trading to be significantly lower. That said, many parts of our 
business should continue to perform
 
well.
 
Let me touch on the CCAR examine and SCB results. This year, the new SCB 
results confirmed what we had believed for many years that we carry 
significant excess capital. We still believe that our PPNR is understated and 
we will continue to work with 
the regulators to better calibrate the models to 
the realities of our business.
 
Our excess capital position allows us significant flexibility to continue to 
support our clients, invest in our business, grow our balance sheet, and 
continue to pursue inorgan
ic opportunities in our target areas. In the near
-
term, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend of $0.35. Over time, 
we expect to reinstate our buyback and increase that dividend, subject of 
course to regulatory approvals.
 
Let's turn to E*TRADE. I re
main as confident, if not more so about the 
strategic benefit to Morgan Stanley from this transaction. Among many 
positives, it delivers; it gives us strong digital capabilities, a platform for 
international expansion, a world
-
class workplace business, and
 
will further 
enhance our CET1 ratio.
 
Before turning to Jon, let me touch on the recent events affecting the black 
community, particularly in this country, but also in many places around the 
world. It is clear that the racial injustice that exists in our s
ociety for a very 
long time has not been resolved. We at Morgan Stanley want to be part of 
the solution. As part of our continuing efforts in this area, we recently added 
a commitment to diversity and inclusion as our fifth core value and made a 
number of 
other structural and financial decisions to materially enhance the 
opportunities provided to our diverse employees. We will be doing more in 
the coming quarters to ensure that our employee population mirrors the 
broader society in which we operate and live
 
in, and we will provide detail 
around our recently announced Institute of Inclusion.
 
So let me now turn the call over to Jon, who will discuss the results of the 
quarter in greater detail. Thank you.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Thank you and good morning.
 
In the second qu
arter, firm net revenues were $13.4 billion, with net income 
applicable to Morgan Stanley of $3.2 billion. The quarter included an 
intermittent net discrete tax expense of $134 million, which impacted EPS by 
$0.08. Excluding this item, net income was $3.3 
billion and EPS was $2.04. 
Also excluding this item, our ROE and ROTCE were 16.4% and 18.6% 
respectively, and our year
-
to
-
date basis ROTCE was 14.2%.
 
As part of our decade long business transformation, we have taken a highly 
integrated approach to client c
overage. Our business segments and divisions 
work together to deliver a wide range of solutions and the firm's intellectual 
capital to our clients. This long
-
term coordinated approach has allowed us to 
provide a deeper level of service and stronger partner
ships with our clients 
and has positioned us for our results this year.
 
Throughout we remain disciplined around our expenses working diligently, to 
manage down our efficiency ratio, and our fixed cost base. This quarter 
illustrates the significant operatin
g leverage in the model especially in 
Institutional Securities. Quarter
-
over
-
quarter, ISG revenues was up over $3 
billion, while non
-
compensation expenses were down over $100 million.
 
Our firm efficiency ratio was 68% in the quarter. High levels of client 
activity 
led to elevated transaction
-
related expenses, which were offset by a 
dramatic reduction in marketing and business development and continued 
discipline around professional services costs.
 
We continue to support our employees and 
communities through these 
challenging times through financial, equipment, medical, and other means of 
support. We remain focused on opportunities to work smarter and more 
efficiently. We have learned a lot about our organization and its cost 
structure thro
ugh this period and we will leverage that learning to continue 
to optimize how and where we work and how we use our technology.
 
Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities reported revenues of $8 
billion, a post financial crisis record and nearly $2 bi
llion higher than the 
prior best quarter. Record results were realized across various businesses, 
products, and regions.
 
Our Integrated Investment Bank benefited from our coordinated and client
-
focused approach. We saw significant demand for our leading re
search and 
bankers to help clients navigate these uncertain markets. Corporate clients 
took the opportunity to raise capital and liquidity and sales and trading 
investors actively repositioned their portfolios given the rapidly changing 
environment. Robust
 
underwriting volumes also contributed to increased 
levels of sales and trading activities.
 
Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.1 billion increasing 79% from 
the prior quarter. Underwriting drove the results delivering its strongest 
performance in 
over a decade.
 
From a geographical perspective, all regions saw sequential improvement 
with particular strong results in the Americas.
 
Advisory revenues increased 28% from last quarter to $462 million 
benefiting from higher completed M&A industry volumes d
riven by an 
increase in larger transactions. Year
-
to
-
date announced industry volumes 
are down over 40% and we expect M&A to remain muted until there is more 
clarity on the path of the recovery and stability in prices. However CEOs and 
boards are engaged in
 
strategic dialogue is integrated into our clients' 
discussions.
 
Equity underwriting revenues more than doubled versus the prior quarter to 
$882 million, driven by increases across products, follow
-
ons, converts 
blocks and IPOs.
 
Issuance accelerated in the
 
latter two months of the quarter. Global equity 
volumes were the highest in nearly a decade as clients bolstered their 
balance sheets and monetized equity stake. The quarter saw record 
convertible issuance as near zero interest rates and elevated volatili
ty led 
issuers to favor equity linked instruments.
 
Fixed income underwriting revenues were $707 million, up 59% from the 
prior quarter driven by bond issuance. Global high yield new issue volumes 
in June represented the highest ever recorded. Investment gr
ade market 
also saw record issuance volume.
 
Activity has been driven by a combination of companies looking to fortify 
their balance sheets and others taking advantage of the very constructive 
financing environment.
 
After unprecedented levels of capital rai
sing, issuance levels are likely to 
slow from the current quarter pace as we enter the summer. Pipelines 
remain healthy, particularly IPOs, and if markets remain constructive, we 
would expect active issuance in the latter part of this year.
 
Equity sales an
d trading revenues increased 8% sequentially to $2.6 billion. 
Strong performance in cash and derivatives as well as a rebound in prime 
brokerage balances contributed to results.
 
Cash and derivative revenues were the highest in over a decade driven by 
stron
g trading results across regions as we continue to help our clients 
navigate through this period of unprecedented uncertainty. In cash in the 
face of historic volumes, we executed for clients and help keep markets open 
and functioning. And in derivatives r
esults were strong across product types.
 
Prime brokerage results were resilient and in line with the prior quarter. 
Balances rose significantly from March lows as market levels trended up and 
certain clients re
-
levered. Although second quarter average bala
nces were 
about 15% below the first quarter.
 
Fixed income sales and trading had its best quarter in over 10 years 
excluding the impact of DVA with robust performance across all major 
businesses and geographies. Revenues of $3 billion increased 38% from the
 
strong first quarter. Results were particularly high in April as macro 
benefited from elevated volatility and wider bid offer spreads and credit 
markets retraced much of the first quarter movements. Clients were 
especially active in the beginning of the q
uarter and remained engaged 
throughout, the market spreads normalized and volatility evaded. We 
continue to see improvement in client penetration as we gain mindshare, 
especially amongst leading asset managers.
 
Micro revenues increased significantly driven
 
by securitized products and 
credit corporates. Macro performance is strong across products, though 
declined versus the robust prior quarter.
 
Commodity results also remained strong, benefiting from continued elevated 
levels of market volatility in oil and 
metals.
 
Across other sales and trading and other revenues results improved 
dramatically from the first quarter. The three main drivers across these lines 
include investments associated with deferred cash
-
based compensation or 
DCP, performance of our $41 bi
llion held
-
for
-
sale portfolio, and our provision 
for credit losses for our $43 billion held
-
for
-
investment loans. The sum of 
these components was approximately $200 million this quarter versus a 
negative $1.1 billion in the first quarter. Spreads tightened
 
throughout the 
quarter leading to approximately a $250 million gain on mark
-
to
-
market of 
our held
-
for
-
sale portfolio, net of losses on our hedges. Our provision for 
loan losses was $223 million, down from $273 million in the first quarter and 
DCP swung po
sitive this quarter as markets recovered.
 
Our ISG loans declined by approximately $11 billion from the prior quarter 
driven primarily by pay downs in our corporate and event book, as clients 
took advantage of open and active capital markets to replace shor
t
-
term 
funding with longer
-
term capital.
 
Our funded ratio of corporate loans peaked at over 25% of commitments in 
1Q and now stands at 18%.
 
Our allowance for credit losses on loans increased to $756 million which 
represents a 43% build in our allowance ove
r the quarter.
 
Our loan book continues to perform well, and we had no charge
-
offs in the 
quarter. Currently, we've approved less than $1 billion of requests for 
principal and interest forbearance across ISG loans.
 
As you can see in our new disclosure on Pa
ge 11 of the financial supplement, 
our allowance for corporate loans increased to 3.8% and our allowance for 
commercial real estate increased to 3.1%. Across the entire held
-
for
-
investment portfolio, our total allowance rose to 1.8%.
 
Now turning to Wealth 
Management. Second quarter revenues were $4.7 
billion, DCP losses of approximately $425 million from first quarter reversed 
almost entirely and prepayment amortization declined. These factors drove 
the sequential increase in revenues. Pretax profit was $1.
1 billion and pretax 
profit margin was 24.4%. The underlying growth drivers remain strong. On 
the heels of the technology and risk management investments we have 
made, client asset consolidation continues. We increased retail asset capture 
and retention an
d lending penetration with our existing clients. Additionally, 
net recruiting has materially improved.
 
Transactional revenues were $1.1 billion. After excluding the impact of DCP, 
transactional revenue was down versus a prior period reflecting a decline in
 
client activity from the extremely high levels of the first quarter.
 
Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion down 6% sequentially; lower 
starting asset levels drove this decline.
 
Lending growth in the first half of the year has been strong at over $5 
billion, with balances of $85 billion, up 15% versus the prior year driven by 
securities based lending and mortgages. The loan portfolio continues to 
perform extremely well. We saw mortgage forbearance remain stable at 
approximately 2% of the portfolio and
 
our 90
-
day delinquencies are at 24 
basis points.
 
We've granted approximately $1 billion of forbearance on commercial real 
estate loans in our tailored lending book, each of which has personal 
guarantees from ultra
-
high net worth clients.
 
We had less 
than one basis point of net charge
-
offs in our wealth lending 
book year
-
to
-
date and provision for loan losses of $23 million was in line 
with last quarter.
 
Net interest income was $1 billion. Excluding the impact of prepayment 
amortization, NII was relativ
ely flat compared to prior
-
quarter and exceeded 
our expectations. The impact of lower rates was offset by elevated LIBOR 
levels and spreads at the beginning of the quarter and higher lending and 
BDP balances. We expect to see NII drift lower for the remain
der of the year 
as LIBOR and spreads have normalized.
 
Growth in our lending businesses and higher levels of stable bank deposits 
should continue to offset some of the pressure from lower interest rates.
 
Total U.S. bank deposits were $236 billion. The meani
ngful increase in bank 
deposits that we saw in the first quarter was sustained and we continue to 
see BDP balances grow. Clients remain cautious as cash and short
-
term 
securities levels remain over 20% of total assets. We expect to see an 
outflow for delay
ed tax payments.
 
Total expenses were $3.5 billion, up 19% sequentially. The increase was 
driven by higher comp expenses principally related to DCP.
 
The Solium integration and execution of our Morgan Stanley at Work 
strategy are on track and are important p
recursors to our integration of 
E*TRADE. We continue to add new corporate clients approximately 180 this 
year, and 525 since the announcement of the Solium acquisition. We 
continue to prepare for the expected closing of the E*TRADE deal in the 
fourth quart
er and have started to incur expenses in advance of the closing. 
Excluding these integration and acquisition
-
related costs in the second 
quarter, the margin would have been over 25%. These integration and 
acquisition
-
related expenses will likely erode the 
margin by 50 to 100 basis 
points this quarter as well. After we close E*TRADE, these integration costs 
will be more substantial and we will provide further breakout at that time.
 
Investment Management revenues increased 28% to $886 million 
representing the
 
second highest quarterly level in over a decade. Total AUM 
rose 14% to a record high $665 billion of which long
-
term AUM was $397 
billion. Long
-
term net flows were also a record at $15.4 billion across 
strategies from a broad base set of global investors.
 
This equates to an 
annualized rate of 18%. Total net flows were $36 billion. Strong fund 
performance, our deep global client partnerships and the power of our brand 
have driven this industry
-
leading flow growth. Our clients are entrusting us 
with their as
sets. We continue to deliver differentiated value to our clients 
across both public and private markets as well as through our global 
solutions capabilities.
 
Our global active equity strategies continue to deliver significant 
outperformance and are attract
ing robust flows from institutions and wealth 
management clients, both internationally and from the United States. 
Liquidity inflows remain strong with positive flows across strategies. Asset 
management fees of $684 million increased 3% sequentially driven
 
by 
higher management fees on higher average AUM.
 
Investment revenues were $230 million in the quarter. The sequential 
increase was supported by the rebound in global markets. We continue to 
invest in the investment management business and to focus and exe
cute on 
multiple organic and inorganic growth opportunities to meet client needs.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets rose to $975 billion in line 
with their recovery in equity markets and high levels of client activity. 
Standardized RWAs were 
flat at $416 billion as an increase in market risk 
assets was offset by a decline in credit risk assets. Our standardized CET1 
ratio rose 80 basis points to 16.5% compared to our recently announced 
SCB of 13.4%. Our board declared a $0.35 dividend per shar
e.
 
Our tax rate was 22.6% for the quarter excluding $134 million of 
intermittent net discrete tax expense. We continue to expect our full
-
year 
2020 core tax rate will be approximately 22% to 23%.
 
The second quarter illustrates that our strategy is working 
and highlights the 
power of our differentiated model. We were at the forefront of serving our 
clients when they needed us most.
 
As for the operating outlook, the dispersion of potential macro outcomes is 
high. The pass
-
forward will largely be determined by
 
the course of the 
COVID pandemic, the shape of the economic recovery and potential 
additional fiscal stimulus.
 
We continue to see reasonable client activity in the first few weeks of the 
quarter, but would expect a reversion to more normalized levels as w
e head 
deeper into the summer. Aspects of the capital markets business will likely 
normalize and a rebound in M&A activity will take some time.
 
In Wealth, we would expect to see continued momentum around new assets, 
new clients, and lending growth as we be
come a destination of choice for 
financial advisors.
 
In Investment Management, our record flows will support fee growth and 
investment returns will depend on the macro environment. We will continue 
to focus on what we can control, serving our clients, mana
ging risk, and 
controlling our expenses.
 
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions].
 
Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now 
open.
 
Brennan Hawke
n
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick note like the 
DFAST results, recent results certainly reflect the improvements and 
resilience that you guys have made in the model and that must be a nice 
affirmation for all the hard work you've 
been putting in, so congrats on that. 
When we think about the wealth management business and the pretax 
margin, how should we think about, is it just backing out the 425 DCP from 
both revenue and comp and would that result then in the sort of core pretax 
m
argin being demonstrably higher and is it fair to say that just maybe the 
headwinds from the environment were not quite as profound as you 
anticipated, and profitability in this business is going to be better as far as 
the outlook? Or is it not that simple
?
 
James Gorman
 
It's sort of that simple. Firstly, thank you for your kind comments. To 
address the broader with the DFAST, SCB numbers and these results and 
the upcoming closing on E*TRADE assuming the shareholder vote happens, 
which is imminent, which I e
xpect it will. I clearly feel that we're at a 
different inflection point that we've been building towards for many years. 
So these results affirm that and I'm sure we'll talk more about it.
 
On wealth management I mean you can do Brennan obviously, you can 
do 
the math on the DCP, which basically nets revenue against comp expense. 
The wealth management margins, the material change in those margins was 
the net interest income change in rates and as we move to zero rates now 
you can have a view rates will be pe
rmanently zero in which case we'll have 
to do other things to enhance that business by the way E*TRADE operates 
with margins around 40%, 45% at the moment. So with some of the 
restructuring that we'll be doing putting those two businesses together, 
there c
learly is margin enhancement opportunity just from that trade alone.
 
But in the last few months, we had low market prices at the points where we 
price the fee income, that's obviously improved. We had a little bit of a rush 
of activity, but we had not near
ly as much because our clients are very 
stable and very fee
-
based.
 
So, in the wealth business, what I look at is the fundamentals, assets are 
growing, flows are growing, fee
-
based flows are growing, loan book is 
growing, deposits are growing, advisor attri
tion is basically zero. We're 
attracting net advisors, we're consolidating E*TRADE, we're opening up 
some international growth platforms. We've got a lot of opportunity to make 
the business more efficient and more technology driven. And interest rates 
will
 
look after themselves at some point. So I remain extremely optimistic 
about the business.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay, great. Thank you for that. I appreciate that James. And when 
following
-
up on that, when we think about NII, Jon, I think you said you 
expect it to drift lower by is it that the impact turned out to be a little bit 
more muted than you all expected and this is the right jumping off point 
with a more modest headwind from here or is there 
--
 
was there some one
-
time noise in the quarter aroun
d NII within the wealth business?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
I mean, I think it's, as I said in my prepared remarks, Brennan the 
performance is better than we expected. If you recall, in the first quarter, we 
thought that the impact of all the rate cuts, we sort of tried 
to size that for 
you. And it's performed better. The primary drivers are as I said the 
elevated LIBOR. Now that's normalized. And so that's why I'm suggesting 
that the NII is going to drift lower. I think the first two quarters if you 
eliminate the prepaym
ents have been pretty, pretty neutral and stable in 
terms of NII and that normalization is going to cause the drifting down 
slightly of the NII going forward, and then it should be stabilized.
 
What we are seeing is that some of that loss that we expected, 
we picked up 
in terms of just the balances both the lending balances and the excess 
deposit balances have abated some of those headwinds. So it's better than 
we expected but still clearly impacted by the zero rate environment.
 
James Gorman
 
And just to buil
d on that, I mean, we can't control the NII, obviously, very 
little given where rates are. But what we did see and what I saw in the last 
financial crisis, those institutions that have strong and stable attract flows 
disproportionally. In the last crisis, 
we were obviously not that institution. 
And we're in fact losing outflows not dramatically, but we certainly weren't 
adding and we were losing 
--
 
we were losing a little bit on the margin. This 
crisis, the reverse is happening. We're attracting positive fl
ows and 
significant and positive FA talent. And that's just a function of strength and 
stability. So I think that does very well for the future of that particular 
business.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your 
l
ine is now open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thank you. So I heard you loud and clear on the first couple of week's 
leasable activity and expect the summers to settle in. I do think we're still at 
a volatility level that's almost double like last year, so it might se
ttle in at a 
higher level. I'm not asking you to comment on that. But I do want you to 
comment on the FICC franchise. Obviously the world changed and lots of 
repositioning happened but you're way over where you used to think your 
expected quarterly levels 
will be. So what I do want to ask is what have you 
noticed on the client front in terms of the coverage taking on new clients, 
client wallet penetration because we haven't seen everybody's results but I 
think these results show you taking share in a great 
quarter, great quarter 
for everybody but taking share despite that.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Yes, I think it's really a little of everything, every business contributed. We 
risk managed extremely well and recognized the team now has been 
working together for about three
 
years. They're really working well. I've 
commented about some progress we continue to make in mindshare of our 
FID clients, particularly around asset managers in penetrating those 
accounts, through the coordinated approach. So it's been a really strong se
t 
of sort of backdrop, but also playing to the sort of the work that we've been 
doing in that business and investing in. Clearly the market or the wallet is 
significantly up this quarter. And we participate in that growth and we 
believe we captured more sh
are to the degrees that the wallet shrinks.
 
We feel very good about the positions that we've established and we expect 
to continue to maintain that share but it's really going to be the results being 
driven by what the wallet size looks like going forward.
 
James Gorman
 
I would add, I mean I'd take it back and Glenn, you've been covering us for 
a long time, so you know the history. But let's get back to 2015 and when 
Colm and Ted restructured the FICC business and I think it's the fourth 
quarter, November/De
cember, we cut the RWAs; we cut the people and the 
expenses by 25%, which was seen as pretty brutal at the time. The RWAs 
came down from I forget the original numbers but somewhere around $300 
billion to about 140 over a couple of year period. And we got o
ut of the 
physical commodities business, we had a much smaller footprint in the 
structured trading business, the SPG business was run a lot more tightly. 
And I think the work the team put together to create an integrated 
investment bank leveraging the incr
edibly strong equities franchise with 
many of the same clients who are dealing with that fixed income franchise 
and at the same time building up DCM which created obviously further 
opportunity across all of fixed income. So it's a series of things.
 
Now we 
always said that the business was long
-
term if it couldn't do a billion 
in revenue in a quarter, it really wasn't a viable business, so it was never 
going to meet its cost of capital. And we sort of set that target that there 
was a minimum threshold agains
t the backdrop of doing $500 million, $600 
million for two quarters in 2015. So that was pretty modest backdrop, and 
obviously our competitors were doing multi
-
billions at that point. We then 
consistently delivered the last couple of years ran a $1.5 billi
on a quarter; 
we kind of normally raised our minimum target to $1 billion in a quarter 
acknowledging you might have a bad quarter occasionally. But we derisk 
that enormously. So the swings are much less volatile.
 
On the downside here, we benefited from the
 
massive financing wave very 
active markets. I think a really good integrated investment bank led by Ted 
Pick, Sam Kellie
-
Smith running fixed income, who'd been previously number 
two guy in the equities franchise for a long time. Putting all of that the 
ma
nagement together, the culture together, the risk management together 
and away from the big structure their liquid positions and away from 
physical commodities. And it's all started to come together.
 
So we're picking up share, and when you have a market ex
plosion that 
everybody's numbers are up, I don't know 60%, 80% then off our base; you 
can stop posting really respectable numbers. And that that's sort of where 
we've got to, so it's really a multi
-
year story.
 
Now are we going to do $3 billion in fixed inc
ome revenues this quarter? No, 
we're not going to $3 billion revenues at least from what I see in the 
outlook, but that doesn't mean we're going to have a bad quarter by any 
stretch. So it's that kind of backdrop that I feel, I feel really good about our 
s
hare position globally against the banks who never have some of the big 
macro businesses that the big universal banks have particularly in FX where 
we just have a much smaller footprint but nonetheless our macro business 
traded really well.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
We
ll, that brings us to the follow
-
up is now that the Fed has realized what 
you and many others thought about your capital 
--
 
excess capital position. 
You've mentioned in the past about using some of it to augment the 
franchise and asset management. But let'
s say the shackles come off 
sometime next year doesn't matter when, what's your thought process 
around deploying capital? Are there places to meaningfully deploy capital 
across the markets franchise or is the plan the same? Use it to augment 
Asset Manageme
nt return the rest like how are you thinking about the 
excess capital now that the Fed suddenly agrees?
 
James Gorman
 
I don't think this is either this or that. We're in a great position now. We've 
got under the SCB about 200 basis points of excess capital 
will pick up. Jon 
is saying actually 
--
 
Jon Pruzan
 
300.
 
James Gorman
 
300 I'm sorry, short changes by 100 basis points who knew that could 
happen? We've got the CET1 will be enhanced further by the E*TRADE 
closure. And obviously, it's not at that level, but
 
it's still additive to our 
capital base. If we come in with an SCB shortfall, we'd be looking at doing 
things with the RWAs in the business, there'd be more pressure on that, we 
don't have that pressure.
 
So the share gains that we've picked up, we can 
maintain or even enhance 
and strategically we'll look across the trading franchise not to go 
gangbusters on that but are there opportunities where we can continue to 
pick up share possibly. We're certainly open to that.
 
In asset management, as you know, we
've talked about this for a number of 
years because we're 
--
 
our asset management franchises, as I said our 
numbers have gone from beginning of 2019. I think there are $480 billion 
we're over $630 billion, $640 billion now attracting really good flows to 
p
latforms building out well. We'd love to augment that, so that's a clear 
intent.
 
Wealth management we did it with E*TRADE. So the opportunity to use 
capital at four. One, around further balance sheet expansion, if we want to 
do that, and advices to be cons
ervative. To be fair, we don't but the good 
news is we're not going to have to restructure or shrink our business 
because of some capital shortfall. So number one that. Number two Asset 
Management transactions. Number three, just investment in our platform
 
and our technology to continue to modernize Morgan Stanley. Number four, 
a dividend we're paying out about $0.35 a quarter, which is about $2 billion, 
bit over $2 billion annually. We made in the first half of this year about $5 
billion. So we've covered 
almost two
-
and
-
a
-
half years of dividends in the 
first half of this year. So our dividend coverage is very comfortable. I would 
love to expand the dividend in time I've always said, I think we should pay 
out effectively what we make in wealth management as 
dividend and think 
of that as a yield stock and think of the institutional business as the growth 

 
And then obviously getting back on the buyback train. We've still got, we've 
got a $1.5 billion and a change of shares outstanding. W
e started this at 
about 2 billion. We'd like to continue to drive that number down. We don't 
want to sit on this capital not put it to work for shareholders. We want to put 
it to work.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Au
tonomous. 
Your line is now open.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Good morning, James and Jon. Maybe Jon, to clarify 
--
 
ask again what 
Brennan asked, but just to clarify in the Wealth Management NII at the 
jump
-
off points for 3Q is $1 billion in 2Q and that will drift lower
 
from $1 
billion right just because there's confusion around 
--
 
you're talking about ex 
prepaid numbers et cetera. I just wanted to clarify that it's really the $1 
billion in this quarter. And that's how to think about where the jump
-
off 
point is.
 
Jon Pruz
an
 
Yes, the first two quarters again were approximately $1 billion.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay, perfect. Okay, thank you for that. And then just more broadly, I think 
you alluded to learn a lot about the expense structure of the business over 
the last few months.
 
So maybe just provide a bit more detail on kind of how 
you're thinking about what you've learned. And then sort of like how you 
think that ultimately affects the long
-
term efficiency ratio potential of the 
firm?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
I would say, Christian that firs
t of all, the crisis is clearly not over. We're still 
in the middle of this and we're continuing to learn about our infrastructure 
and our employees and what's the most efficient way to work. So those 
comments were really around first we have to get throug
h this. And then 
longer
-
term, I think there's some interesting things that can come out of it. 
Clearly, the work
-
from
-
home as a backup 
--
 
as a backup or DCP planning 
measure is clearly an acceptable one. We've been now at 90% of the folks 
working from home
 
for a while now. And the plan continues to hold up quite 
well. So I think there's some things that we can learn from that as well.
 
And so I think again, longer
-
term real estate decisions take a long time, 
given leases and ownership. But I think that we'll
 
take a look at the footprint 
over time. But our first priority right now is to get through the health crisis 
and keep our employees safe.
 
James Gorman
 
Let me just say a couple of things about expenses. And about that real 
estate comment in particular beca
use something I said, I think, on the last 
call, or on a TV interview was picked up and blown out of proportion.
 
First of all on the real estate footprint, I said we've learned to live with all of 
our people working from home or most of them and therefore 
that gave us 
an opportunity to rethink our real estate strategy. That was interpreted by 
some in the media, as we're going to radically shift our footprint in major 
locations, that's not going to happen. We committed to the major cities in 
this world where
 
we have our headquarters here in New York where I am 
today with Jon although socially distance, London, Frankfurt, which we've 
moved in consolidators how European headquarters Tokyo and Hong Kong. 
That doesn't change; Morgan Stanley will remain a major pl
ayer in the 
commercial real estate market globally.
 
However, when we think about at DCP backup centers, when we think about 
our consolidation in various offshore centers and identity management, 
when we think about some of our excess capacity across our br
anch network 
is this the time to start addressing those issues? Clearly, we have more 
flexibility to do it than we would have under normal circumstances. And 
that's what we're talking about. Are we going to be radically expanding real 
estate across the fir
m over the next five years? I doubt that very much, 
whether are we going to be radically shrinking it, I doubt that very much. So 
hopefully that that puts a more reasonable tone on what was picked up in 
those comments.
 
On the non
-
comp expenses, just to say
 
we put on $3 billion of extra revenue 
this quarter. And we put on about $100 billion of extra non
-
comp expenses. 
This business has unbelievable operating leverage. Now, to be fair, it goes 
both ways, right? If you lose $3 billion in revenue, you can't bri
ng down your 
non
-
comps that quickly, so it goes both directions. But if we're in a growth 
mode, and we can control the zone comps and obviously comp except in 
wealth management is simply a ratio that we can manage. You have 
embedded huge operating leverage
 
in the business and that's why we saw 
the ROTCE numbers that we saw this quarter.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of 
America. Your line is now open.
 
Mike Carrier
 
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.
 
First seems like forever 
ago but just how are you thinking about some of the strategic initiatives, 
that you highlighted at start of the year just given the current environment, 
obviously a lot of puts and takes and however it is still uncertain, just an 
update would be helpful.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, I'll touch on maybe Jon wants to also add a little bit. Just on the 
--
 
I 
think we went public with three metrics, pretax margin sort of medium
-
term, 
and then long
-
term aspiration, efficiency ratio the same and RO
TCE the 
same. Now not to be crude about it. But in this quarter, we achieved the 
long
-
term aspiration of efficiency ratio on the ROTCE. I'm not pretending 
that that's a steady state right now, I'll be very happy if we go back to 
achieving what we said we d
o in the two
-
year period and we're only six 
months into that two
-
year period.
 
So 
--
 
but as I said, we have the non
-
comp operating leverage. So the 
efficiency ratio through revenue growth, I think is slam dunk. The ROTCE 
again with this kind of operating le
verage and without the credit provisions, 
if you have revenue growth, I'm very comfortable with those.
 
The wealth management one that's more challenged because we did not 
expect to go to effectively zero interest rates at the beginning of the year. 
That sa
id even with this environment and with the pretty lousy print at the 
start of the quarter, and with some of the integration costs that coming from 
E*TRADE build in, they still hit margins of over 24%. And I think they will 
grind their way back up into the 
zone that we talked about. How quickly 
that's going to happen, Mike, I'm not going to predict, but it's not going to 
be forever.
 
So overall, we stand by the strategy, but we can't nobody in this world can 
predict. Goodness, what the next month is 
going to be like, let alone the rest 
of this year and we've got a Presidential election coming. All sorts of massive 
uncertainty. Some of that uncertainty as we just demonstrated plays to our 
favor. So I don't, Jon, I'm sure will have a view on when these 
medium term 
goals, when it's realistic come and talk seriously about them again, but it's 
too early yet. But it is interesting that through the first half of this year, 
we're basically on track for two of the three of them.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
And the only other ob
servation I would make is when we laid out those 
goals, we hadn't announced E*TRADE transaction yet either. So we're going 
to 
--
 
I think the course of the rest of the year and getting the deal closed 
and seeing where we end up and then when we come back in
 
January, I'm 
sure we'll update you on what we're seeing and how we feel about those 
goals.
 
Mike Carrier
 
Okay, makes sense. And just a quick follow
-
up on E*TRADE, just given a lot 
of the industry changes in wealth and online banking. You guys mentioned in 
providing you with online brokerage in like the corporate platform, how are 
you thinking about like the online banking to kind of aspect and in addition 
to that RIA custody platforms?
 
James Gorman
 
The online banking is clearly additive building out digital
 
banking across our 
millions of households and our wealth management using the E*TRADE 
platform so that's clearly additive.
 
The other question was, I think the RIA platform, early days, but I always 
--
 
that's a decent business model. It just isn't one that
 
we've had. Now we've 
got an opportunity with it through E*TRADE and I like why not, right. That's 
an opportunity for us to pursue, but it's very early days, it's a tiny business 
for them. Our major obviously the elephant is that core advisory business, 
an
d that's not going to be disrupted. But we'll take a look at the RIA stuff as 
we get into it next year.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Yes, and I would just add that, the E*TRADE, E*TRADE has performed 
exceptionally well, during this period sort of validated many of the reaso
ns 
why we're so excited about during the transaction. Customer activity levels 
are at record highs, exceptional net new asset and account growth at this 
point through their public disclosures through May, they've sort of 
outperformed on new assets and clie
nts sort of all of last year. The plant has 
held up very well. The technology is excellent. They've had no hard outages. 
And all the reasons why we bought the company, I think have been 
enhanced and validated through this period.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our ne
xt question comes from Andrew Lim with SocGen. Your 
line is now open.
 
Andrew Lim
 
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Great results. I just thought that if you 
could talk a bit more about your both E*TRADE ambitions. I know obviously 
the numbers and your ta
rgets are going to be disclosed later. But 
strategically can you talk more specifically about what you currently 
achieved with the integration in terms of like maybe like ambitions on 
revenue synergy front? Or would it need like a scale gain obviously like
 
the 
big UI in asset and wealth management, plus efficiencies you get. And then 
secondly, a few of your competitors have talked about the shape of fading 
for the second half. I was wondering what your expectations were for the 
second half versus the first 
half, but also versus the second half of 2019. 
Thank you.
 
James Gorman
 
Well, I will touch briefly on the strategic rationale for E*TRADE. We did that 
earlier this year. But I'll repeat that and Jon I'm sure will have a crystal ball 
on what the second half 
is going to look like versus the second half of last 
year. I'll be interested to hear his crystal ball because we're all kind of 
curious how it's going to unfold. But I will say I'm very comfortable with 
Morgan Stanley as an institution through the second 
half of this year. We 
have many, many businesses and much of our revenues that are not driven 
by the volatile trading activities. So anyway, I'll let Jon handle that one.
 
Just quickly on E*TRADE, Andrew as you know and I think as we said very 
clearly at th
e time, it makes us I think the largest player in the workplace 
sector in this country which is the third channel for client acquisition behind 
some sort of advisory personal interaction and digital. It makes us the 
second or third largest player in the di
gital space and we're the first largest 
player in the core advisory space. So we're on all three channels. It 
diversifies our revenues as an institution by adding $3 billion of revenue, it 
improves our CET1 ratio. It gives us a platform to stay digitally 
i
nternationally; it creates an opportunity for us to build the digital bank 
across our wealth management business.
 
They have a small RIA platform which I mentioned, which is interesting. We 
have obviously some expense consolidation across the two platforms.
 
They 
have a terrific brand for a younger generation of investors; they have a 
terrific brand for more active trader investors and options trading investors, 
which we're excited about. So there are a long line of things that make this 
attractive and the te
st was how did they hold up in this period of incredible 
volatility. And as Jon just said, they hold up extraordinarily well. They've 
attracted hundreds of thousands of new accounts.
 
But with that has come real money, not just kids playing. This is real st
uff. 
They brought in billions of dollars of net new assets and deposits. And their 
platform has remained very stable. So that is the E*TRADE story. It's a 
continuing evolution of the Morgan Stanley strategy and a nod to the fact 
that having stronger digita
l capability across our wealth management 
business is critical and a nod to the fact that we're interested in expanding 
internationally.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
I will not attempt to make a crystal ball prediction. But given some of the 
comments that I made in my openi
ng remarks, clearly, we have a 
differentiated model with wealth and IM which is sort of the stability of that 
model. And those businesses should continue to perform quite well.
 
And then the 
--
 
which we referred to historically as wallet, and then the ISG 
c
reates some of the alpha. As James said, it would be hard to see how we 
reproduce the first half results and the second half results. But we also think 
we'll continue to do quite well given the market share gains that we've made 
and the client penetration 
that we have and it's really just going to be a 
function of what the wallet size is in the second half. And I don't think 
anyone has the ability to predict what that will be.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. 
Your line is now open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Right, great. Good morning, I guess first question here with respect to 
DFAST and thanks for the color and obviously overall positive outcome. But 
James, you mentioned working with the regulators is stressed scenarios 
aren
't I don't think necessarily reflecting how the business actually behaves. 
And we've seen that in trading over the past couple of quarters in what's I 
think a real world stress test. So I'm just curious if these are normal 
conversations just around future 
DFAST assumptions and modeling that you 
kind of always have, or is it related to the 2020 outcome? It sounds like 
some peers like Goldman are potentially petitioning for some relief so just 
kind of curious around that comment.
 
James Gorman
 
Yes, I think Dev
in, I don't want to get ahead of the regulators and we 
haven't obviously discussed anything relating to capital and capital 
requirements in the light of these earnings, but it's a more fundamental 
view. If you go back to 2008/2009 regulators would be entir
ely justified and 
being highly skeptical of Morgan Stanley's business model at that point, 
given the trajectory coming out of the financial crisis. And the early days 
when the integration of Smith Barney looked to be slower than what most 
people had hoped 
had never bothered me by the way, but most people were 
anxious about it.
 
So there was kind of a period of let's just wait and see. And I think some of 
the market models that they put in place that affect all of the banks 
disproportionately hurt Morgan Stanley. As the time has progressed and the 
business model has played out and the stability the franchise is now fully 
tested here and was producing ROE over 15% and most of the competitive 
set are 400 to 800 basis points bel
ow that. It certainly gives pause to reflect 
on the stability of the business model.
 
Now, let's play it out a couple more quarters. I've said for a long time that 
PPNR results do not reflect certainly what we think about the business. And 
for that we belie
ve that there is a model issue relating to financial advisor 
compensation, how fixed that is believed to be when in fact, it's not fixed at 
all. It's a commission based structure. So there's potential further regulatory 
relief on that, which we've been arg
uing for many years. And I think it's well 
understood now by the regulators.
 
But listen, Morgan Stanley is not the Morgan Stanley it was 10 years ago, 
we're different, we're a different institution. We didn't have the credit 
provisions that everybody else 
had. That's not luck, that's by design. We 
don't have exposure on secured consumer credit, we have very little 
emerging market credit, we have very little small business, middle market 
lending. It's by design.
 
So at some point if your model is built, not t
o endure the credit kind of hits 
the other banks naturally have given their portfolio. And you don't have the 
illiquidity that you had in your trading businesses. And you have the balance 
of the wealth management and the repetitiveness of those revenues an
d 
earnings then you're a different kind of animal. And that's really what we've 
been arguing for a long time.
 
I'm not going to get ahead of the regulatory discussions, we've got another 
CCAR test, Jon coming, I think in the next couple of months. So clearl
y, that 
test will reflect the COVID type world more explicitly than the last one. And 
we'll play it out, we'll play it out. But Morgan Stanley currently has excess 
capital. And I believe 
--
 
we just accreted another $3 billion. I believe we're 
going to crea
te excess capital through the rest of this year and be sitting 
with many billions of dollars of excess capital at year
-
end and we want to do 
something with that.
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Let me just add a couple of quick observations. One, there is a formal 
appeals proc
ess. We are not entertaining that. These are just natural and 
normal dialogues we have with our regulators and as James said, we've 
been talking about it with them for years; I do think that we saw some 
recognition of that in this year's results. Some of t
he PPNR modeling is more 
reflective of more recent results. And obviously, given the transformation 
that we've gone through, we started to see some of that in the results. But 
again, we think there's more there.
 
And then on the last point of a resubmission
, as James said, the Fed did 
release sensitivity analysis, it was very geared towards lending and credit 
losses. As we mentioned, we do have a differentiated portfolio not only in 
terms of its makeup, but also in terms of its size. We've avoided unsecured 
consumer, very limited small business, middle market, small commercial 
banking. So it's just a much different model. And I think it will fare quite well 
in the resubmission. And obviously, we've all seen what the trading results 
have been through this mini
 
stress test.
 
So we feel good about the capital position, we feel good about where we 
stand in CCAR and we continue to talk to our regulators about sort of the 
results and the transformation that this company has gone through.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our 
next question comes from Robert Rutschow with Wells 
Fargo. Your line is now open.
 
Robert Rutschow
 
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First question is on 
deposits. How did the delay in the tax deadline impact deposits in the 
second quarter? 
Have you seen a run
-
off in the last couple of weeks as we 
approach the deadline? And is there still an opportunity to reinvest some of 
those deposits at higher rates to pick
-
up some yield?
 
Jon Pruzan
 
Sure. So it clearly has had an impact. The payment date 
was yesterday. 
Typically, we see the runoff sort of post the payment date. Historically, it's 
sort of been in and around $5 billion to $6 billion. So we would expect 
something comparable and similar there.
 
But I think the interesting dynamic around the dep
osits are, as you said, we 
have the excess position, we've seen sort of a rotation into the markets 
really flowing. So if you look at this period, we saw about $20 billion of cash 
come into the system from a combination of dividends and interest, but also 
new cash into the system. And only $15 billion of that went into the market 
so net up $5 billion in BDP.
 
As I just said, we would expect to see some of that flow out with tax 
payments. But what we've definitely seen is last year this period, that 
number wo
uld not have been positive at all, it was about a negative $10 
billion. So the deposit levels have really stabilized and started to creep up. 
And I think what the opportunity for us is, as the durability of these deposits 
increase, and we've seen them pret
ty stable now. We'll probably just 
continue to pay down some of our higher costs, wholesale liabilities, we've 
got about $25 billion of CDs that are run
-
off over the next 18 months, we 
clearly don't need to replace those and some other third
-
party arrangem
ents 
as well. So it's really going to be around reducing some of the wholesale 
liabilities and then continue to deploy that into the lending growth that we're 
seeing in that business.

1/24/11,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations.
 
During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and 
financial supplement, copies of which are available at 
www.morganstanley.com.
 
Today's presentation may include 
forward
-
looking statements that are 
subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ 
materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward
-
looking statements 
and non

GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This 
pres
entation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.
 
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. After 
a 
challenging end to 2015, and frankly difficult start to this year, Morgan 
Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter.
 
The major strategic goals we outlined are trending in the right direction. 
Wealth management's pre
-
tax marg
ins hit the lower end of 23% to 25% 
range for next year. Fixed income is on course for an annualized quarterly 
revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter and project streamlines progress is 
evidenced in 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter. The 9% to 11% RO
E target 
for next year remains our focus. Traditional businesses of strength namely 
equities and investment banking remain solid. Additionally, investment 
management rebounded from its underperformance a year ago but more 
progress needs to be made.
 
We're c
omfortable with our strategy in competitive positioning but by no 
means are we complacent. We have much more work to do.
 
On the business side, expense management program has to run its full 
course. Fixed income needs to evidence continued consistency and o
ur 
wealth management business needs to adapt to ongoing changes such as 
DOL and digital innovation.
 
On the regulatory front, we need to successfully meet our obligations that 
include resubmitting our capital plan and addressing shortcomings in our 
recovery
 
and resolution plan. Furthermore, we have to ensure we're 
prosecuting our business optimally given the proposed inclusion of the GSIB 
buffer into CCAR and any other regulatory changes.
 
The firm is well positioned to move past these challenges and then foc
us on 
growth opportunities.
 
Finally, we must remain extremely vigilant about our collective actions and 
constantly reaffirm Morgan Stanley's core values. Putting our clients first and 
doing the right thing essential to our culture. If we embrace these simp
le 
objectives every day of work and every time we face the decision, I'm 
confident that the inevitable outcomes of these efforts will be achieving our 
financial goals.
 
Needless to say, we can never control for all the vagaries of market and 
geopolitical un
certainty, but our job is remain nimble as circumstances 
warrant and mitigate risk when called upon. Our senior team is battle 
hardened, loyal, and highly motivated to succeed. I'm proud of the way they 
are leading our employees through these ever changing
 
times and I have 
every confidence they will continue to do so.
 
I'll now ask Jon to discuss this specific quarter in much more detail.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you, James. Good morning. The third quarter results demonstrated 
progress against the strategic obj
ectives we outlined earlier this year. While 
slower summer markets generally impacted client activity and volumes, our 
business mix generated solid results. For the quarter, we reported firm 
revenues of $8.9 billion unchanged versus the second quarter. PBT
 
was $2.4 
billion and EPS was $0.81 a sequential increase of 8%. The results yielded 
an 8.7% ROE.
 
Before discussing the businesses performance I want to touch briefly on the 
progress we have made on projects streamline. We remain on track to 
achieve our ob
jective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year
-
end 2017 
on flat revenues. Year
-
to
-
date non
-
compensation expenses have decreased 
by approximately $800 million or 10% versus the same period last year. 
While some of that benefit is related to lower revenu
es, the vast majority of 
the 200 expense initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will 
continue to be carried out through year
-
end 2017.
 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence and have hired 
more than 650 employees in lo
wer cost locations. The vast majority of these 
hires have been offset by a corresponding reduction in the headcount in our 
core locations. We are progressing towards our target of hiring 1,250 
employees in our centers of excellence through 2017. We have be
gun to 
recognize savings from shutting down the two North American data centers 
and are on target to close the remaining two next year.
 
Further last year's restructuring of fixed income sales and trading continues 
to be a tailwind through the overall non
-
c
ompensation expenses base. In 
addition to the meaningful divisional headcount reduction, we have also 
realized savings in operations and other support services.
 
In addition to support service efficiencies, our streamline targets were 
predicated on compensa
tion savings and lower litigation spend. Year
-
to
-
date 
our ISG compensation to net revenue ratio was 36% compared to 38% over 
the same period last year, excluding DVA. Litigation expenses have also 
decreased year
-
over
-
year. Our targets continue to assume th
at we will not 
see any new outsized litigation expenses or penalties.
 
Our CCAR resubmission as well as potential future cost associated with 
Brexit, will serve as headwinds to streamline. The CCAR resubmission has 
demanded resources both people and money a
nd will remain a medium
-
term 
expense.
 
Despite these cross turns we are on track to deliver the $1 billion reduction 
in expenses by year
-
end 2017.
 
Now to the businesses. Our institutional securities franchise performed well 
in the third quarter. We showed l
eadership in our businesses of traditional 
strength, equity sales and trading, advisory and IPOs while continuing to 
make progress in fixed income sales and trading. ISG net revenues were 
$4.6 billion essentially unchanged on a sequential basis. Non
-
compen
sation 
expenses were $1.5 billion for the quarter up slightly on a quarter
-
over
-
quarter basis but down versus the prior year. Compensation expenses were 
$1.7 billion and year
-
to
-
date our ISG comp ratio was 36%.
 
We remain disciplined on compensation and are
 
committed to our target 
ratio of less than or equal to 37%.
 
In investment banking we generated $1.1 billion in revenues in line with our 
2Q results. Year
-
to
-
date we were number one globally in IPOs and number 
two in announced M&A, completed M&A, and equit
y and equity linked 
offerings. Pipelines are stable and markets are generally constructive but as 
one would expect the timing and pace of future deals will be a function of 
the market backdrop, issuer confidence, and investor appetite.
 
Advisory revenues fo
r the quarter were $504 million up 1% versus 2Q '16. 
M&A announced volumes are running approximately 35% below last year's 
heightened levels as lingering uncertainty and increased regulatory scrutiny 
have weighed on activity. However the pipelines remain h
ealthy and clients 
are engaged and interested in discussing strategic transactions.
 
Equity underwriting revenues were $236 million, down 11% versus 2Q. Debt 
underwriting revenues were $364 million, up 6% sequentially. Equity 
underwriting activity remains w
ell below historical levels. We saw a slight 
pick
-
up in IPO activity toward the end of the quarter and we will have to see 
if that trend continues. In equities, we expect to be number one globally. 
Revenues were $1.9 billion representing our best third qua
rter in recent 
history with solid results across regions. Revenues were down 12% versus 
the strong second quarter impacted by a lack of specific macro events, a 
muted underwriting calendar, and light volumes that are traditionally seen 
over the summer mont
hs.
 
Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives as 
performance was aided by a number of meaningful corporate transactions 
underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank.
 
Results were offset by a 
sequential decrease in cash revenues on lower 
volumes and lower prime brokerage revenues driven by seasonality.
 
Fixed income sales and trading had a solid quarter with revenues of $1.5 
billion, up 14% versus the second quarter. A more constructive backdrop
 
in 
the last two quarters resulted in an improved trading environment.
 
The benign credit environment with tightening spreads broadly and in 
Europe in particular following the Brexit vote yielded stronger sequential 
performance in corporate credit. SPG also
 
benefited from a favorable credit 
environment and increased volumes in agency trading further benefited our 
micro businesses. In macro, we witnessed an increased level of client 
engagement in rates largely attributable to divergent expectations around 
cen
tral bank policy.
 
Fixed income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $344 billion at 
September 30. Fixed income revenues year
-
to
-
date are $3.6 billion. We 
remain comfortable with our objective of maintaining the revenue footprint 
we had over the last
 
few years. This restructuring is a multiyear process and 
we remain focused on supporting our clients and delivering results.
 
Other revenues were up versus the second quarter primarily driven by gains 
on our relationship and event held
-
for
-
sale loans as a 
result of an improved 
credit improvement.
 
Lastly, average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million down 
versus $46 million last quarter and $53 million last year. The de
-
risking of 
our balance sheet as we continue to adjust the composition of our 
inventory 
contributed to the reduction in VaR.
 
Wealth management performed very well and continued to provide stability 
in the third quarter. Net revenues were up 2% to $3.9 billion which is a 
record for the business. The PBT margin was 23%. Despite retail
 
investors 
remaining cautious, we have good momentum in this business. Total client 
assets increased 3% sequentially to a new high of $2.1 trillion. Fee based 
assets increased 4% to $855 billion which is a new high both in absolute 
terms and as a percent o
f total client assets. The increase included $13.5 
billion in asset flows. These trends position us well for 2017.
 
Asset management revenues increased 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter reflecting 
positive flows and generally higher indices. Net interest income was u
p 7% 
sequentially and 18% year
-
over
-
year. The sequential increase was 
attributable to both loan growth and lower amortization driven by a 
slowdown in mortgage prepayment fees.
 
Bank lending balances were up approximately $3.5 billion quarter

year on track to meet our lending goals.
 
Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged 
from Q2 but down sequentially when excluding the impact of mark to market 
gains on our deferred compensation plans
 
as client engagement remains 
subdued.
 
Total expenses were essentially flat on the quarter. Non
-
comp expense were 
down 3% reflecting continued execution of our expense initiatives, 
notwithstanding continued investment in our digital platforms and 
enhanceme
nts to our infrastructure to ensure compliance with DOL.
 
Investment management saw stable asset management fees and less 
volatility in the investments line. Total net revenues were $552 million, down 
5% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. AUM grew to $417 billion due to
 
market 
appreciation and positive flows primarily in our liquidity products as a result 
of money market reform.
 
Asset management fees for the quarter were $508 million essentially 
unchanged versus 2Q 2015.
 
Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 millio
n essentially unchanged 
versus last quarter reflecting a more stable investing environment. Overall 
expenses were down slightly 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by lower non
-
compensation expenses.
 
We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of investments i
n and 
relationships with legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule across 
the firm. While we expect to request additional extensions for the 
overwhelming majority of these investments, we continue to consider 
various alternatives to be in compliance
 
with the rule, including sales, 
redemptions, and liquidations where the amounts we ultimately realize on 
these investments may be less than their current carrying values.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $814 billion on September 
30, down f
rom $829 billion on June 30. The spot decrease was primarily due 
to a redesign of our wealth management client suite 
--
 
excuse me client 
cash suite program in light of money market reform and a decrease in firm 
liquidity following Brexit.
 
Pro forma fully p
hased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be 
approximately $368 billion essentially flat to the second quarter. Our pro 
forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio 
increased approximately 20 basis points to 15.9%. Our pro for
ma 
supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was up approximately 10 basis 
points to 6.2%.
 
During the third quarter we repurchased $1.25 billion of common stock or 
approximately 41 million shares and our board declared $0.20 dividend per 
share. Our tax 
rate in the third quarter was 31.5% and going forward we 
continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. We have good momentum in our 
business and have made demonstrable progress towards our 2017 9% to 
11% ROE target. That said we have more work to do. We must con
tinue to 
execute on the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year including the 
implementation of our bank strategy and focus on expense management.
 
We also continue to invest in our businesses through digital offerings, 
electronic trading capabilities
, preparation for DOL, and additional regulatory 
conformance. We will continue to focus on the levers within our control and 
we feel confident that our ROE target is achievable.
 
Currently markets are constructive but both markets and investor sentiment 
wil
l be impacted by some major events on the near
-
term horizon, including 
the upcoming U.S. election, the outcome of Fed policy action, and the Italian 
referendum to name a few. Closure around some of these risk events will be 
an important factor for investor
 
conviction and corporate confidence.
 
With that, we will open up the line to questions.
 
Question

Answer Session

[Operator Instructions].
 
Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning. Tha
nks for taking the question. One I guess starting out on 
FIG, not really, really encouraging to see the solid back to back results here 
this quarter and last. Can you help us understand whether or not there may 
be might have been some changes to risk manag
ement that has gone along 
with the new leadership team and may be could you have any facts you can 
share behind it may be, inventory loss facts or something along those lines 
to support may be a higher base line results or at least less volatility?
 
Jonatha
n Pruzan
 
Sure, I'll take a try. I think when we said out on this restructuring what we 
said is we wanted to have a credible and critically sized business that was 
relevant to our clients and supported adjacencies that exist within our ISG 
franchise, for example, leverage finance with our M&A business. We also 
said we wanted to maintain the revenue footprint while reducing the balance 
sheet, the capital, the expenses, and the headcount in this business. We're 
three quarters into it Brennan, 
we've generated $3.6 billion of revenue year
-
to
-
date so that put us on track to maintain our revenue footprint that we 
saw over the last couple years.
 
I think the success that we've had have has boosted confidence and the 
team continues to jell. But it is 
early. This is good results for the quarter but 
we need to do this over multiple years not multiple quarters. I think the 
leadership has started to jell and bring the sales and trading businesses 
together. Consolidating, as you said, the risk management an
d some of the 
infrastructure support behind that and we've seen some real learning's from 
that experience and I think that's been a positive from a results perspective. 
But this quarter also benefited from just a good backdrop particularly for our 
business
es around new credit and SPG line items, we saw tightening 
spreads, better environment in Europe on ECB buying, better distressed 
trading volumes, better volumes in SPG, so good backdrop and good 
performance against that.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
That's helpful, tha
nks Jon. Do you have 
--
 
can you give us a sense, is it 
possible to give a sense about how much you guys might guess the positive 
environment helped result this quarter; is that just too difficult to try to see 
that?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Any question where you a
sk if you want me to guess, I'm going to have to 
say no. Thank you.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
All right. And then shifting gears on to the wealth management business, 
can you share any plans that you might have around Fiduciary rule 
compliance, a very large competito
r of yours has confirmed their direction, 
which is to not use the deck and so curious about what gets into your 
approach there and whether or not, you see potentially divergent policies as 
the business opportunity here as we move forward?
 
James Gorman
 
What
 
whether or not, I'll touch on that. Firstly the team is going to be 
coming out making some announcements over the next couple of weeks. So 
Brennan I would like to get ahead of them but I think it's fair to say our firm 
view is that optimizing choice for o
ur clients given them the choice of how 
they deal with the firm, services to access, how they pay for those services, 
is critical to how we operate as a firm. At the same time obviously we're 
operating on whatever the regulatory constraints are. But the ch
oice has 
been a fundamental sort of guiding like for the firm and that is unlikely to 
change.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. That's very clear, it's very clear, thanks James. And then I guess one 
more question I would have is on 
--
 
also on wealth management. We saw 
the deposits drop quarter
-
over
-
quarter and isn't it that 2Q is sort of a soft 
base to build off of given the taxes. So could you help us understand what 
drove the change in deposits this quarter versus last within wealth 
management; is there any shift happ
ening there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
From a fundamental perspective there is no real shift in sort of client 
behavior as I mentioned Brennan in our 
--
 
in my prepared remarks that we 
did change our client cash management suite program because of money 
market reform
. We had clients that were in prime funds that we're going to 
go to a floating NAV and with the gates and so forth, we did make a change 
in sort of how we sweep deposits based on thresholds and client preference 
first into BDP and then into government fund
s, so that had a slight decrease 
overall but it did actually improve the liquidity of those deposits as uninsured 
went down and insured went up.
 
But the BDP number is relatively flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter, so we haven't 
really seen any major change in behav
ior and as I said before it's still pretty 
subdued in terms of the investor sentiment.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay, terrific. Thanks for clarifying that, much appreciate it.

Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore 
ISI. Your line is 
open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Thank you. Jon two quick follow
-
ups from some of the comments you made 
earlier. One I appreciate all the color you had on project streamline. I just 
want to make sure, did you or can you give us a number of what of the 
billion is in the current run rate or what's less? And then your comments 
around as we approach the July 2017 deadline on broker compliance, I 
appreciate the potential filing extension, but what is the size and type of 
funds that we're talking about I'm as
suming it's some of the real estate 
funds that we built with Asia but such size and type of funds and are they 
above or below cost base right now? Thanks.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'm going to go back to the first question first which I now actually forgotten.
 
Glen
n Schorr
 
Project streamline, what is in there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Streamline thank you. So again there are a couple of different components 
to it. I think it's what I would say is that we're going to 
--
 
we feel very 
confident about the $1 billion. We've shown
 
good 
--
 
we've shown good 
progress on the controllable expenses around as I said. If you look not 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter but year
-
over
-
year around occupancy, around T&E 
around some of the professional services that $800 million I'm not going to 
go line by li
ne there is some benefits from the fact that revenues are down a 
bit, but we feel confident that we're going to hit both or the $1 billion target 
which obviously includes compensation savings.
 
On Volcker its $2.3 billion which is why we 
highlighted that number there 
has been some confusion around it. And we have our intent is to file for 
extensions through the overwhelming majority of that. We have options for 
the other funds well as it relates to the July deadline.
 
And then to your quest
ion I mean obviously currently the funds are at NAV 
now. They are basically historically whether it be real estate or private 
equity but it's the mix of the businesses and asset classes that we have been 
in historically.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
I'll go appreciate tha
t last follow
-
up or it's question may be James. RWA is 
down a lot it's like down 16%, you got 15.9% CET1. You had a great result 
in capital return but capitals buildings is this high class problem you have, I 
think you'd be at the high
-
end of your ROE targ
et range now if you had a 
similar capital ratio to the peers and you're above 10 on a tangible so. Can 
you talk about how you address that in terms of just keep doing what you're 
doing try to get more out is the give and take but it's kind of capital.
 
Jame
s Gorman
 
Yes, it is. I mean Glenn we're you know this is not a trend, it's obviously a 
marathon we're trying to build a firm that's resilient forward times, we're 
trying to be ahead of whatever the regulatory requirements are. That has 
been as you and ever
ybody else know is a moving piece. We have the GSIB 
buffer coming into play obviously there is going to be some netting against 
that, if I read the speeches right around the shape of the balance sheet 
growth and around whether one is told to buyback commit
ments for the nine 
quarters.
 
So we need to see the GSIB buffers. We took our buyback from zero to 500 
to 1 billion to 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion in the last several years. We took our 
dividend from $0.05 to $0.10 to $0.15 to $0.20 a quarter. So pretty 
sign
ificant progress. But you're right; we have a high class problem. I mean, 
I was amused watching some of the pundits on TV the other day talking 
about ROE and how different is from pre
-
crisis and I was one the yellow, the 
screen yellow well that might have 
a little bit to do, with the capital being a 
little different pre
-
crisis.
 
We had $30 billion of capital pre
-
crisis; our ROEs would be comfortably 
above $0.20 now if we were operating the business like that, but clearly that 
would not be a good or appropria
te operating model.
 
So we are approaching I think we were at or near the top of the large banks 
in terms of payout ratio. I can't remember exactly but I think it was in the 
high 80s or even 90% ratio. This year we're continuing to create at a pretty 
spotty
 
numbers as you point out and but we've got somewhere to talk in 
between times. We've got a resubmission on CCAR; successful resubmission 
would dictate whether our current capital program remains intact. So that 
has all of our attention. And then the 2017 
CCAR program is just around the 
corner in April I think the submission is. So if you got to have a problem in 
terms of returns in this business that might rather be because you got too 
much capital. That I would argue as our problem.
 
Achieving a 100% payou
t ratio is obviously a terrific position for us to target 
and that's what we're targeting and then we'll sort of take it from there. But 
this has been a multiyear restructuring, I don't think any bank has wanted to 
try and get ahead of the capital ratios g
iven that all of the rules have not 
been fully baked in as Jon just said we're dealing with the Volcker 
dispositions that will happen and whatever extensions we get from June 
2017 but obviously we got some dispositions going, we've got the GSIB 
buffer in a
ction, the resolution plans are still working, working their way 
through, all the banks are resubmitting those, so there is a still a lot of 
moving parts.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Fair enough. Thanks James.
 
James Gorman
 
As a shareholder, frankly I as a shareholder tak
e comfort from the fact that 
we have the capital that we have.

Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi. Another question on fixed income and I hope you can appreciate some 
concern 
about fixed income given the record over the last 10 to 15 years 
they were certainly much better than expected. To what degree are the fixed 
results are taking more risk, page six of the supplement shows VaR is down 
for rates in FX and commodities but up i
n the credit portfolio and to what 
degree are the better results in fixed result are taking shares say from 
European banks and if you can address prime brokerage too?
 
James Gorman
 
I may be just start on that Mike and I will let Jon get into it. But listen 
we're 
not and did not in the second quarter run any victory lap around fixed 
income. We said we're targeting a $1 billion a quarter on annualized basis. 
We said there will be volatility around that by the very notion, very aspect of 
the markets. We're obvi
ously did much better than probably anybody 
thought this quarter and part of that is the functional mix of our fixed 
income business but a more credit dependent business.
 
But that said we have made real changes to this business. We did bring 
down the RWAs 
from $390 billion to about $125 billion now. We did take out 
25% of the total headcount cost and people in December of last year and 
we're currently on track for the $1 billion run rate in fact a little above it but 
again we're not too focused on the quart
er
-
to
-
quarter moves and I think the 
question underlying it is, the teams do something on the risk front which 
was sort of further standard deviations out from what we have typically been 
doing the last couple of years, I think the answer is clearly no.
 
And
 
we can, Jon, will take you through some more details if it's more to add 
to it but this is the business which, as you know, and if you look at the 
street numbers, I think all of the banks surprised on the upside but it was a 
better macro environment, ther
e was more volatility post
-
Brexit, there was 
more volatility around rates because of the Fed multiple talking voices of the 
Fed and the credit markets turned out.
 
So if you're in the fixed income business, you're going to have a better 
quarter, we're in 
--
 
we had a better quarter, what I am pleased about is we 
did it with 25% less people. Jon, do you want to add anything?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Not now. I'll add Mike with other parts of I'm sorry 
--
 
with the other parts of 
the question that James didn't addresses 
it you like me to tackle.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Well at least, I guess the flip side is the market share gains, I mean to the 
extent that you have to potentially use your balance sheet more than some 
global banks that are restructuring, how much of that is a factor in
 
FEC or 
trading or capital markets generally?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen I think what we've generally said is that we feel very comfortable with 
our competitive position, you can see our ranking quarter
-
to
-
quarter share is 
sort of hard to look at 
because as James mentioned these businesses move 
around. But certainly over the medium to long
-
term, we have a very strong 
position, we've got a nice global footprint, we have got to defined strategy, I 
wouldn't say not all of our peers could probably say 
that, so I think over the 
medium to long
-
term, we think our competitive position will bode well for us.
 
Mike Mayo
 
All right, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. 
Your line is open.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Go
od morning. May be just a clarification of project streamline, just unclear 
you've done $800 million in expenses so far versus the $1 billion target, 
does that imply $200 million to grow by 2017 or am I wrong?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
There is a couple of things. O
ne is the project streamline is a total expense 
number, so that would include comp and non
-
comp, the $800 million is a 
non
-
comp number that's number one.
 
Number two the premise around streamline was a $1 billion expenses 
assuming a flat revenue environment
. But if you look at year
-
to
-
date 
although we've shown nice progress in the second and third quarter as you 
recall, the January and February market environment but also the first 
quarter was quite soft. So we're actually running year
-
to
-
date below our 
reve
nue from 2015 and so therefore the apples
-
to
-
apples comparison is a 
little more challenging. So I don't think you can do the math that you just 
did.
 
The one thing I will say is that we're confident even with the incremental 
CCAR and Brexit planning expense
s that are probably in the budget at this 
point. We're confident that we will be able to get a $1 billion of expenses out 
of that total $27 billion expense line from last year in 2017.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then just on sal
es practices, I'm 
wondering if you can comment on the Massachusetts securities officers, 
enforcement action around your sales practices, you have to change 
anything, does that impact any your kind of efforts to increase lending 
penetration.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No it doesn't. We are not changing things we are 
--
 
we put out a public 
statement related to Massachusetts we're not going to comment on that. We 
run our business consistent with the base of doing everything we can to 
support our clients, we'll continue t
o do that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with 
Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to have a couple of follow
-
up 
questions on equities and fixed. In equities, you ha
d mid
-
 
single
-
digits 
revenue growth year
-
over
-
year and of the five global dealers reporting so 
far there is once again a big separation between the three firms that have 
sizable prime brokerage activities yourselves and the other two and the 
other players 
who have really fallen behind. Can you talk about that is this 
sort of a coincidence or can you see real evidence that because of the 
strength of that business may be ability to reprise or concentrate share of 
flows that you really 
--
 
you're really able to
 
break out.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I will try Guy listen we are number one in the world in this business. And I 
think we're seeing the benefit of being able to provide clients with value 
across the globe. As I mentioned the third quarter was our strongest in 
equi
ty since the crisis. So we are seeing the benefit of being the number one 
in the world and I think you're going to see just like in many other financial 
services products the concentration of market share among the top players 
and that's what you're seeing
 
in equity.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
And in fixed, can you give us a sense or the degree to which may be a long 
side strong flow activity that you commented on that that revenue might 
have been supplemented by positive marks on legacy long
-
dated derivatives 
or other
 
position?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Listen Guy certainly some of our fixed income businesses we carry 
inventories in those businesses as particularly in our credit and SPG areas 
and tightening spreads around the world we benefit from that. But I can't 
--
 
I 
won't comment on the 
--
 
I think your derivatives but it was a good 
constructive backdrop for this business.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
And just as a follow
-
up to a follow
-
up on that one those types of positions 
are they still absorbing meaningful amounts of capital dr
iving the significant 
part of the RWA that that persists and when we get back to the whole idea 
of long
-
term capital return potential should we be looking over the next 
three to five years for a significant free up of capital from positions of that 
type th
at don't generally generate pretty much revenue.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
The way I would think about is we have a $125 billion of fixed RWAs today. 
We are not meaningfully above or above 2017 target which was $120 billion 
and our longer
-
term target. So we 
continue to move towards those goals. 
We're positioned to running off overtime as we've talked about given the 
liquidity we saw I made a comment that we have been working on our 
composition of our inventory. We saw opportunities to come out of some of 
the 
liquid positions. We've seen a trend towards our clients wanting to trade 
in more liquid products given their view of the world. So we're going to 
continue to manage that business, we're going to continue to run those 
down overtime, and I think we're prett
y close to the ultimate targets in that 
on our balance sheet perspective as it is today.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. 
Your line is open.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Hi, thanks good morning. On GWM may be bigger picture, i
t still seems 
disconnected from history here that retail engagements so as to do it against 
the backdrop where risk assets have performed well and municipal assets 
are growing. So I'm just wondering is there any data or anecdotes that you 
point to that wou
ld suggest that this isn't a secular change around your 
products or demographics?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No, I think, listen there is just been a lot more headlines, there has a been 
lot more volatility, yes markets have been trading up over the course 
certainly 
at this quarter and we're seeing indices at reasonably high levels. 
But on the flip side transaction revenues have historically been driven by 
underwriting calendar, where we've seen a very slow 2016. I think the 
geopolitical risk and some of this politica
l risk and some of these risks that 
are much harder for retail or actually any investor, the probability way can 
get their hands around and probably push people to the sidelines. I don't 
know if it's secular or cyclical at this point but certainly it's at 
very low level.
 
James Gorman
 
I think as having watched this business over two or three decades, I don't 
think I've seen transaction levels lower than this. And just supposed against 
that that the business had record revenues is a testament to the managed 
m
oney side of it, the banking side of it, the deposit side of it, things that 
frankly 15 years ago really didn't exist to a highly dependent transaction 
activity. And the world has changed, investors have changed but we're 
sitting on $2.1 trillion of assets
. And their behavior has changed whether the 
transaction stuff picks up; I don't know post the election, post the Fed 
moving it remains to be seen. My guess is over time it does, I feel just 
intuitively, it feels like a low but can it go low, I guess it co
uld go low but 
probably there is a bias to moving up rather than moving down of the next 
couple of years that said more and more money is going to fee based 
accounts.
 
Devin Ryan
 
Got it, great. That's very helpful and then you guys have $27 billion debt 
mat
uring over the next 12 months. How should we think about the delta 
between those rates relative to the current market rates to try and get a 
sense of what is the magnitude of impact assuming you replace that?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well I think a little way back 
we said that we had a good funding tailwind as 
the maturing debt was much more expensive than what we're putting on. I 
think at this point that has run its course in terms of our new issuance is 
generally in line with what's been rolling off. So I think th
ere is still some 
benefit of sort of annualization and things of that nature but we come to 
probably the end of material end sort of the funding arbitrage that was going 
on.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital 
Markets. Your line is open.
 
Fiona Swaffield
 
Good morning. My question was about net interest income in wealth 
management. Could you talk more about margins and they do seem to be 
pretty strong in the third quarter. But if you adjust for the prepayment whic
h 
I don't think you really knew how much that's impacted Q2, could you help 
us on the trends in margins in wealth management. Thank you.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes at 23.2%, it's obviously at the low end of our range, what we saw in the 
second quarter if you reca
ll in June, rates are coming down, so then 
prepayment fees were accelerating, so we had a negative impact from that. 
We had obviously the opposite this quarter as generally rates have been 
rising throughout the quarter, was not significant contributor to t
he margin, 
we feel good about the progress that we've made. And at the low
-
end of the 
range that is 23.1% 
--
 
excuse me 23.2%, you should also recognize some 
seasonality in this business in terms of the expenses in the fourth quarter 
but again as James said
 
and I said in my prepared remarks given the flows 
in managed money given the lending progress that we've made, we feel 
good about the margins and sort of the progress that we've made here.
 
Fiona Swaffield
 
I'm trying to check on the net interest income mar
gin specifically there is no 
funny that that's a good base from which to focus going forward is just so 
much higher as percentage of assets and it's been for a while?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes that's a good basis, there is going to be some 
--
 
some nominal volati
lity 
because of prepayment fees as our mortgage book grows but that's a good 
base.

Michael Carrier
 
Thanks guys. I guess either for Jon or James, just 
on the DOL, James you 
mentioned you are providing customers with options, just wanted to get 
your sense on how to manage that versus say like the legal side or the legal 
risk. And then I think in the past, you guys mentioned that you didn't expect 
any sign
ificant impact on revenue or expense meaning like the margin, so I 
just wanted to confirm that as we get more information and you guys 
continue to work on strategy.
 
James Gorman
 
Mike as I said, I think the team is going to be saying some here the next 
couple of weeks, so really to be fit, I don't want to get ahead of it, I will give

legal exposure in fact

that just seems a lower counterintuitive. So I'm 
not 
--
 
we run a large complicated business and we do it in full compliance 
with the regulatory rules and we try and optimize what's always in the best 
interest of the clients. So that's the basic pr
inciple.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
And Mike on the second half of your question obviously there were drafts to 
the DOL rule out last year so we were informed when we gave you the 23% 
to 25% margin target. What we said about this is that, we think this is going 
to be
 
manageable both from our clients perspective and from a results 
perspective and we're going to work with our clients to make sure that we 
were providing compliant solutions.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay, got it and then just as a follow
-
up Jon, on the buyback, it
 
looks like 
the pace is just ahead off, I guess what you did in the last CCAR universes, 
what you can do in this cycle. And so just wanted to get a sense on you 
have more flexibility in terms of frontloading it and then when I think about I 
think Glenn had
 
the question on just where the capital ratios and the ROE, 
you James, having too much capital definitely in this environment is a good 
spot to be, when you look at the global firms. But on the other hand it does 
weigh on the ROE and on the multiple. So wh
en you look at what you guys 
are doing strategically in terms of focusing on wealth management, you're 
taking down some of the risk on the balance sheet is that starting to 
resonate with the regulators and so did you have the potential to get that 
CET1 rat
io back I guess around the industry average 
--
 
versus at these 
elevated levels?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think as it resonate as regulators, I mean you'll look at the track record. 
We've increased the dividend four years in a row; we've increased the 
buyback four
 
or five years in a row. It's we operate in a world which has 
been an evolving world from a regulatory front and we try to stay ahead of it 
and I think we frankly have done that in terms of where our capital is and 
I'm not going to repeat what I said I thi
nk was related to Glenn or somebody 
on what our plans are but we try and optimize within the rules of what we've 
said at the same time be appropriately conservative until we see where are 
the rules flush out. We'll get a much better sense when the GSIB stu
ff is 
finally written down and then we will know pretty much where we stand.
 
James Gorman
 
And then on the first part of your question as you highlighted we did 
buyback a $1 billion in the quarter this in the third quarter we have a $3.5 
billion authorizati
on that we do have $2.25 billion less to do over the next 
three quarters.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Lim with Societe 
Generale. Your line is open.
 
Andrew Lim
 
Hi, thanks good morning. Just a follow
-
up question on capital. Follow
ing Dan 
Tarullo's remarks on the distressed capital buffer, mostly you've got a very 
strong CET1 ratio but presumably you've also got a very high distressed 
capital buffer but your minimum requirements will be quite high. And I'm 
just making that implicati
on there from the impact on your CET1 ratio under 
the 2016 CCAR process. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are there 
as to what you think your SAP should be what your minimum capital 
requirements could be, I know the rules on classified yet and how 
you 
expect how close you'll get?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Let me try to take a crack out at this. So I would say a couple of things one I 
think it's a little too early to start estimating at STVs and sort of impact. This 
is obviously going into effect in the 2018 C
CAR. So for 2017 what James has 
said and what we said at the beginning of the year is that we were capital 
sufficient and we would like to try to return capital above the current levels 
that we have and we're going to continue to do that follow that strate
gy in 
'17. And then in '18 as the NPR becomes rule and we have a better sense of 
what the ins and outs and the takes are will be in a better position to tell you 
what we think the capital outlook looks like then.
 
The one point which is reasonably clear fro
m Governor Tarullo speech is the 
integration of sort of stress testing into the baseline capital ratios in business 
as usual and that's a trend that we've seen for a while, so I think broadly 
speaking although there were some lack of some of the details th
e speech 
was sort of broadly in line with our expectations.
 
Andrew Lim
 
Right. Thanks for that. And then just a follow
-
up question just with 2016 
CCAR and the comments people have been making about the FIG business 
possibly you've got quite a big impact the
re on the 2016 CCAR versus the 
severity [indiscernible]. And I was just wondering, how you're trying to up 
with the bank over your business, why would that be the case especially 
given that you're relatively light on FIG versus some of the peers, is it the
 
case that maybe that's a reflection of maybe higher risk that you might be 
having in FIG and the way you got them done?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'm not sure, I fully understand the question. I will say that I think of the 
large banks we were the only bank that ha
d their stress losses go down 
year
-
over
-
year. I think that is reflection of the actions that we've been 
taking around the risk of the overall risk in our balance sheet. We continue 
to look at inventories and manage those businesses and try to shrink where 
we can I mentioned that in my comments. So again I'm not sure, I 
understand what you're driving at but I think we are and I think our absolute 
stress loss is relative to the other big banks were also below those levels. So 
I think we are starting to see th
e benefit of the risk reduction that we have 
taken and I think that will continue to persist.
 
Andrew Lim
 
Right but the absolute delta in your starting CET1 ratio and then where it 
alludes to under the severity adverse scenario and that's relatively quite 
l
arge versus all the U.S. banks and I was just wondering well why you think 
that would be the case?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No again I think the way I would look at it is, we have been able to increase 
our capital return quite dramatically over the last several yea
rs and our 
ratios in CCAR last year ended up higher than the year before. So I think 
there is recognition of the risk reduction and the transformation that we've 
taken both on the revenue and the risk side.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from 
Eric Wasserstrom with 
Guggenheim. Your line is open.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Thanks very much. Jon I'm sorry if I missed this but in the institutional 
securities, what drove the non
-
comp component up sequentially? It was up 
about 5% 
quarter
-
on
-
quarter.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes I mean on a quarter
-
over
-
quarter basis it's going to bump around as I 
highlighted year
-
to
-
date for the firm non
-
comps are down dramatically. So 
to be honest if these things are not straight lines but we feel confiden
t that 
we've got 
--
 
we've got good expense management in place.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Got it. I mean I guess I was wondering if it was just a function of the 
business mix given that some of the market revenues have more volume 
related components.
 
Jonathan Pruza
n
 
No I mean I think that was not really a driving force you do know we have a 
retail CCAR resubmission in 2000 excuse me in December of this year, so 
there was some incremental expenses that we didn't expect to have from 
that perspective. But again these t
hings are going to bounce around quarter
-
over
-
quarter and we feel very good about the $1 billion target we set for 
next year.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Great. And if I can just maybe follow
-
up on the capital question, as we think 
about the longer
-
term targets, can 
you just help us frame whether that 
target contemplates or what it contemplates, I guess is really the question in 
terms of capital levels like in other words like to getting to the high
-
end 
assume stable or lower levels or does it continue to reflect an e
xpected 
amount of capital accretion?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I'm sorry the high
-
end.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
So if you look at the 9% to 11% target, all right, what is the equity 
assumption underlying that relative to where we are today, is it continue to 
capital accreti
on and net income is just expanding ahead of that accretion or 
is it some expectation of reduction?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Well again I think when we laid out the 9% to 11% for 2017 in the beginning 
of the year, we said we had sufficient capital and therefore we 
wanted to try 
to maintain that capital level. You've seen that we've accreted a bit because 
obviously the payout ratio is based off of net income and we do issue equity 
to our employees as part of compensation, so we are accruing a little bit of 
equity. It
 
was predicated on that sort of general math that it would creep up 
but nothing dramatic. And what we said in January, which I think is actually 
even more consistent now with some of the comments around Governor 
Tarullo speech about actually implementing t
hose changes in 2018 is that 
--
 
that's our current thinking for '16 and '17. And then we'll obviously analyze 
the new rules as far as '18 CCAR, see where the progress that we have 
made on the balance sheet in the fixed income restructuring and then make 
an
other assessment at that point.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with 
Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Hey, good morning. May be quick follow
-
up in the ROE targets the 9% to 
11% next year you
 
are sticking with this but as we look at the presentation 
from January you were sort of under the expectation that revenue growth 
would be 3% to 5% annually obviously year
-
to
-
date that 
--
 
we haven't hit 
those numbers. So what gives you the confidence or w
hat's changed in 
terms of your ability to still hit the 9% to 11% is it just greater expense 
confidence how do we think about that in the context of clearly consensus 
with employing an ROE below 8% doesn't clearly believe you can get there?
 
Jonathan 
Pruzan
 
Listen, I think we've shown some really good progress against the goals as 
you do mention the revenues are down '16 versus '15 year
-
to
-
date. But the 
target was for 2017. We think we can continue to make more progress on 
the margin and wealth. As I m
entioned some of the flows and where we are 
in terms of our assets under management and our lending progress helps 
position our business for '17 continued leadership in equities and IBD where 
we like our positions in our global footprint. So we'd like to c
ontinue to press 
our advantage there. And we have more streamline to go.
 
So first quarter very challenging but we put up 8.3% in the second, 8.7% in 
the third and we're a lot closer to that 9% to 11% we clearly need 
constructive markets but I think that's 
what our confidence is being driven 
by we're closer to that number and we still have some of the initiatives and 
slightly we expect to realize them in '17.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Okay, that's fair and then may be on the capital size. I think CET1 clearly 
very strong
 
but the SLR I guess is where if you look at your progress to
-
date, it's been not as rapid on the RWA side in fixed income is that what's 
driving the slower progress on the SLR and you still feel confident you can 
get to the targets?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, t
o the last question obviously the SLR is the just a bigger denominator 
and therefore the changes that we have been making accrue more slowly to 
that number. But at 6.2% relative to what the minimums are and what our 
expectation is on CCAR is a strong numbe
r as well.

10/21/10,Morgan Stanley,"Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During 
today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial 
supplement, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com. 
Today's presentation may include 
forward
-
looking statements that are 
subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ 
materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward
-
looking statements 
and non
-
GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This 
pres
entation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.
 
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James 
Gorman.
 
James Gorman
 

introductory remarks and then Jon will take you through the numbers and of 
course we both as always look forward to your questions.
 
Our results this quarter reflect solid performance in an improved but 
obviously still relatively fragile environment. Our te
am had several 
objectives coming into the quarter as follows: managing the uncertain 
macroeconomic environment; continuing the momentum we are building in 
fixed income while preserving stability in our other businesses; maintaining 
expense discipline; and 
obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR. 
By and large, we met these objectives and despite the overall lack of 
commission in the market, we executed on our strategic plan and performed 
well in the areas of traditional strength. We saw continued 
stability and 
progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with 
expectations given the environment. We made particular progress in fixed 
income and commodities where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in 
revenue, up significant
ly from the first quarter. Jon will take you through 
each of our businesses in a moment.
 
On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline but tactically and 
through project streamline. We're now a simpler organization and therefore 
must be leaner and 
more efficient in our spend. We discussed initiatives that 
are currently underway last month at our financials conference and are 
pleased with product streamlines progress to date. Our ROE for the quarter 
was 8.3% and demonstrated progress towards our 2017
 
target.
 
Finally, we received the non
-
objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 
capital plan. We believe this decision reflects the changes we undertook as 
well as our business mix stability. The approval enables us to increase our 
dividend to $0.20 p
er quarter and to repurchase up to $3.5 billion in 
common stock over the next 12 months commencing in the third quarter. 
CCARs outcome reinforces our aim to steadily increase the return of capital 
to shareholders over time and indeed it marks the fourth co
nsecutive year in 
which we have done so. We were also asked to resubmit our plan due to 
certain deficiencies that the Federal Reserve found in our capital planning 
process. We're working extremely hard to ensure a successful resubmission 
towards the end of
 
this year.
 
On the macro environment a lot was going on. Britain's decision to leave the 
European Union created uncertainty that is likely to persist for some time as 
the market grapples with the political and economic paths forward. As we 
said publicly, w
e consider this outcome suboptimal, but it did indeed provide 
us with a live stress scenario as we endured record high volumes and spikes 
of volatility, our liquidity remains strong, our systems ran smoothly and our 
clients access the market quickly and in
 
size.
 
I will now turn over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail and again look 
forward to your questions in a few minutes.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Good morning. As James said, the environment in the second quarter was an 
improvement over the first. However, we
 
continue to see macro uncertainty 
and with that periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events including 
Brexit have kept market participants on the sidelines as they wait for clearer 
trends to emerge. Despite this backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivere
d solid 
results.
 
For the quarter, we reported revenues of $8.9 billion versus $7.8 billion in 
1Q. Non
-
interest expenses for the first quarter were $6.4 billion versus $6.1 
billion last quarter. The increase is primarily driven by increased 
compensation exp
ense on higher revenues. Profit before taxes for the 
quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q 2016 highlighting the 
operating leverage we have in the business model.
 
Project streamline remains on track. In mid
-
June James highlighted some of 
the k
ey initiatives that have been identified to meet our objective of 
reducing our cost base by $1 billion by 2017. These initiatives will continue 
to be carried out through the next 18 months but substantial progress has 
already been made. We continue to leve
rage our global centers of excellence 
to optimize workforce costs. We have hired 250 employees with our 
objective of hiring 1,250 employees through the end of 2017. Offsetting this 
headcount has come down in our metro higher cost locations. We're 50% 
compl
ete with our objective to close four North American data centers and 
are on schedule to close the remaining two by 2017.
 
We continually seek ways to deploy technology to drive efficiencies and 
automation. To that end, we just rolled out a cloud based procu
rement 
platform which will drive future savings through more straight through 
processing and payments, and greater intelligence and purchasing decisions. 
We continue to show greater discipline around our non
-
essential travel and 
have achieved a 50% reducti
on through the first half of the year as 
compared to the first half of 2015.
 
Turning to Institutional Securities, revenues were $4.6 billion, up 23% 
quarter
-
on
-
quarter. Non
-
compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the 
quarter, essentially flat to the fi
rst quarter. Streamline initiatives offset costs 
associated with rising revenues. Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion. 
Our ISG year
-
to
-
date compensation to net revenue ratio was 36%. We 
remain committed to our compensation ratio target of less than or 
equal to 
37% we set out at the beginning of the year.
 
In investment banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, up 12% 
sequentially. Year
-
to
-
date we were number two globally and announced 
M&A, completed M&A, IPOs and equity and equity linked offerings.
 
Advisory 
revenues for the quarter were $497 million, down 16% off of a strong 1Q. 
Dialogue and interest in strategic transactions remain strong but below the 
2015 pace.
 
M&A announced volumes are running 20% to 25% below last year and we 
would expect that 
to persist. Equity underwriting revenues were $266 
million, up 66% versus 1Q and debt underwriting revenues were $345 
million, up 44% sequentially. Although we saw improvements in 
underwriting, activity remained below historical levels. As we have 
mentione
d on past calls, we have a healthy pipeline of transactions waiting 
to be executed. Issuer confidence and investor appetite will be critical for the 
results in underwriting to improve. In equities, we remained our leadership 
position and expect to be numbe
r one globally with revenues of $2.1 billion, 
up 4% sequentially.
 
Second quarter 2016 was a strong quarter across products and regions as 
we continue to work with our clients through uncertain times. Cash equities 
was up sequentially. Derivatives remained 
robust. Prime brokerage 
continues to be a steady performer and we improved the efficiency of our 
balance sheet. Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues 
were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter.
 
Revenues improved sequentially across 
credit, macro and commodities 
businesses. Our credit businesses benefited from a tightening of spreads. In 
particular, securitized products performed well against this backdrop. In 
macro, we provided support to our clients leading up to and through the 
Bre
xit referendum were prudent risk management contributed to higher 
revenue sequentially.
 
Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market 
conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits resulting in an 
increase in client activity. 
Fixed income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR 
exposure was $353 billion in the quarter. Other revenues were up versus 
first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for a held for 
investment and held for sale relationship loans.
 
Lastly, average
 
trading VaR for the second quarter was $46 million, flat to 
last quarter. VaR was generally range found over the quarter inclusive of 
Brexit. Wealth management performed well in the second quarter with 
revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially. Even th
ough we have not seen 
a pickup in retail engagement, this business continues to provide stability 
against an uncertain macro backdrop.
 
Total client assets of $2 trillion increased 2%. Fee based assets hit a new 
high of $820 billion. And flows in the quarte
r were $12 billion, up from $5.9 
billion in the first quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat 
sequentially, though up 12% year
-
over
-
year. Lending balances were up $3 
billion quarter
-
over
-
quarter and $11 billion year
-
over
-
year. which has 
resulted 
in a significant increase in interest income.
 
This growth was partially offset by an increase in amortization as a result of 
a pickup in mortgage prepayment fees as rates declined. Our bank NII 
forecast that we shared in May remains unchanged and we are on
 
pace with 
our bank growth target for 2016. Transactional revenues were $798 million 
this quarter, up 10% sequentially. This improvement was driven by mark to 
market gains on our deferred compensation plans and not a rebound in 
activity.
 
As mentioned befor
e, transactional activity remains subdued. On expenses, 
compensation was up 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our compensation ratio 
decreased to 56.5%, which reflects the benefit of our strategy to grow non
-
compensable revenues. Non
-
compensation expenses were esse
ntially flat to 
1Q. We continue to invest in digital and our infrastructure to ensure 
compliance with the DOL.
 
Our PBT margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 1Q 2016. We 
remain confident we will hit the 23% to 25% pretax margin target we set fo
r 
2017, despite the slower than expected pace of future interest rate 
increases. In investment management, revenues were $583 million, up 22% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter 
were $517 million, essentially flat vers
us 1Q.
 
AUM was also essentially flat at $406 billion, a continuation of the trend that 
we have seen over the last several quarters. Investment revenues in the 
quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q 2016, driven by 
improved performance across a
 
number of funds including private equity and 
real estate investments.
 
Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices 
adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic. Overall, 
expenses were up 7% quarter
-
over
-
quarter
 
driven by higher compensation 
on investment gains.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $829 billion at June 30, up 
from the $807 billion at March 31. This spot increase was driven by a high 
level of activity at the very end of June, primarily 
due to Brexit as we 
supported our clients. We have seen the balance sheet retreat from this high 
in the first few weeks of the third quarter.
 
Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be 
approximately $365 billion, down from 
$385 billion in the first quarter. Our 
pro forma fully phased in advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 
15.8% versus 14.6% in the first quarter. Our pro forma supplementary 
leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1%, up from 6% in Q1. As James 
menti
oned, during the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of 
common stock or approximately 23 million shares and our board declared a 
$0.20 dividend per share.
 
Last night, we announced that we will redeem all of the issued and 
outstanding TruPS by Augus
t 18, 2016. The TruPS carry a blended cost of 

Our tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5%. Going forward we continue to 
estimate a tax rate of 32%.
 
After a difficult start to 2016,
 
the markets and improved in the second 
quarter. However, the world continues to experience significant geopolitical 
uncertainty and with that the potential for economic underperformance. The 
Brexit vote and upcoming US elections have only added to a cloud
y outlook. 
It is too early to predict how the second half will play out.
 
On the one hand, the political uncertainty casts a negative shadow over the 
markets, and will undoubtedly cause some corporations to pause over future 
Capex and other expansion plans 
and many investors, particularly 
individuals remain cautious. On the other hand, the movement in currencies 
and the improvement in commodity and some equity prices is leading many 
clients to begin to position for what might be a volatile second half.
 
Our p
ipelines remain healthy and our business is well positioned, but 
whether this translates into near term business is an open question. As the 
coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client 
opportunities, while staying rigorous to our projec
t streamline and other 
expense initiatives.
 
With that, we will open up the line to questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Guy 
Moszkowski, with Autonomous Research. Your line is open
.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Thank you, good morning.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning Guy.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
First just a question on fixed, obviously a very solid result, and you alluded 
to post Brexit activity, but generally, if you could comment on the ability to 
produce $1
 

out the sale of the oil merchanting and the 25% headcount reduction, at the 
end of last year, is there any warning on sustainability here that you want to 
issue and if not, maybe just give us
 
a sense for how it is that you could have 
done a headcount reduction that wasn't as significant as it was and still see 
revenue in that kind of range.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

our pla
n in the beginning of the year, we talked about being a critical 
incredibly size fixed income business that was relevant to our clients, but 
also supported are other businesses. And what we said is that we were going 
to 
-
 
the goal was to maintain our reven
ue footprint that we had had on an 
absolute basis in the last couple of years. Year
-
to
-
date, our performance is 
at around $2.1 billion to $2.2 million so it's in
-
line with that revenue 
footprint.
 
We saw broad support and broad improvement across all the pr
oducts 
actually in the second quarter. I highlighted SBG tightening spreads help, 
strong performance in agencies, FX was aided by the volatility we saw from 
Brexit, commodities clearly better credit performance we had a much more 
stable backdrop. Oil price
s going from 38 to 48 versus the wild swings that 
we saw in the first quarter, so broadly a very strong performance. It is only 
one quarter. In the first quarter when people were talking about our 
performance we warned that it was only one quarter. We made
 
a lot of 
changes that we think will help this business and this will take time, but 
we've been pleased with the progress that we have seen to date.

Sorry, go ahead.
 
James Go

year and the century, it would appear. Listen, my view was that there was a 
general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC and from the middle of 
last year through th
e first half of the first quarter and I saw very little 

million a quarter I thought the downside risk is very small. The upside risk 
was actually quite high. And that's why we said, we t
hought on a relatively 
normalized basis, a billion dollar run rate a quarter was entirely reasonable. 
The headcount we took out at the end of last year actually many of our 

remarkable a
gainst the context of what was going on in the market. We just 
did it at one point in time.
 
And clearly we were overstaffed at that point in time. And we came to a 
fundamental view at the end of last year to do two things, one is to realign 
the staff for w
hat we thought was a $1 billion run rate business and maybe 
it's more and maybe we're not going to get ahead of ourselves obviously 
there's more this quarter. But we don't think it's materially less than that to 
be honest.
 
At the same time, the second thin
g we did was to align all of our sales and 
trading businesses together. And with that come lots of operational 
synergies, risk management synergies, overall management client coverage 
synergies with our SRM our senior relationship management program and I 
think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the 
realignment, but we felt pretty confident in the months and years following 
it, it would and maybe we're starting to see some of that.
 
Thirdly just on the particular mix of 
our business, obviously we're more 
credit centric to macro, but we do have a very good FX business that 
benefited, you have seen a lot more volatility in rates and clearly the credit 
markets as Jon said recovered not just in the core fixed income business,
 
but in commodities. So, the combination of all of these things said that yes 
it's a good number this quarter. Are we shocked by it? Not really. We 

doing $500 million, $600 million. And t
hat's we're not going to get ahead of 
it. We set a $1 billion run rate and let's see how it plays out over not each 
individual quarter, but over the next couple of years.
 
Guy Moszkowski
 
Okay that answers the question quite robustly thank you. Second big to
pic 
of the century in wealth management is that we keep hearing about is robo 
advice, clearly fees for advice is the core of your wealth management 
business proposition. A lot of talk about the application of robo advice to 
different size accounts, how do 
you intend to protect the franchise against 
revenue attrition from this type of incursion and are there ways that you can 
use these types of technologies to your advantage?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

e heard us 
say in the past we've been spending significant energy and dollars into 
investing in our digital platforms in wealth management. As you know, we 
hired Naureen Hassan earlier this year to run that effort for us. We think 
that the right business m
odel and the winning hand here is a combination of 


some recognition and awards, but there are really three areas 

been focused on.
 
One is around data and analytics so providing our clients with better data 
and analysis so they can more informed and better decisions. Secondly, 
efficiencies around automation; that will be helpful not only from an expense 
stan
dpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not 
focus on paperwork and doing other things like that. And then lastly, most 
importantly, is how our clients interface with us.
 
We have 3.5 million households in our footprint. With man
y different 
investing needs, but also many different requirements and idiosyncratic 
wants and likes, and so we have been building out a broader platform in 
terms of how we interface with our clients whether that's video, whether 
that's in person with their
 
FA, whether that's mobile, whether that's text, 
and we have been doing that for quite some time. So, we have been 
investing in this area. We've told you it's going to be important to the overall 
business. We believe secular trends here are for advice with
 
technology. And 

 
James Gorman
 
And again just to add to this one because it is a critical question, I think that 
one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this 
country is actually extremely di
verse. In our own book of business, only 2% 
I think of our client assets are in households with less than $100,000. We 
have nearly $800 billion in households with $10 million or more. So you got 
to look at the segmentation. You got to look at the complexit
y of the client 
needs of which access through distinct technologies is a clear need, but it's 

million. Portfolio allocation superior product access to our underwriting 
calendar al
l of the other things, which we bring to the party including our 
intellectual capital through our research. So, it's a very important 
development the whole digital development in finance. In my view, it is the 
most important in the payment sector followed 
by the consumer credit 
sector followed by the wealth management sector. But we're making the 
investments. As Jon said through a digit team that we have hired and on 
arranged leadership and we have made the investments and will continue 
making them.
 
Guy Mos
zkowski
 
Great, thanks very much.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your 
line is open.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Good morning James and Jon.
 
James Gorman
 
Good morning.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
One more on and FIC here, you hit on the incr
eased volatility towards the 
end of the quarter leading into Brexit and then coming out of it. Do you 
think that that opportunity allowed you to over earn somewhat in FIC this 
quarter or at least present a more unusual and robust revenue opportunity, 
which
 
is why you were able to punch above that $1 billion per quarter run 
rate, and as we think about that run rate seasonally, when we look into the 
back half, should we think about that being lower or is it going to be less 
seasonal because of the changes you
 
made to the business?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Hi, Brennan. So, the way we would describe Brexit in the impact, I think in 
the first quarter if you recall and then through sort of the conference season 
we said that January and February were very challenging market
s. March 
was more stable, a better backdrop for the businesses that we are in, and 
then April and May looked a lot like March. What we saw in June was sort of 
a continuation of that trend as we approach the Brexit referendum we saw 
people start to realize 
the potential impact of this outcome. And we saw 
more risk management and hedging activity. And then for the couple of days 
right before and right after we saw heightened volatility and significant 
volumes.
 
I would tell you that broadly speaking one or two
 
days does not make a 
quarter for us. It's a much more balanced business than it. Given also all the 
changes that we made particularly around the Oil Merchanting business and 
some of the other actions. We would expect less volatility than we've seen in 
the
 
past. But we are obviously not going to print the billion dollars every 
quarter on the nose, so we're going to see fluctuations in that number. I 
wouldn't say that we over earned. I would say that the volume helped for a 
day or two, but again doesn't driv
e the overall performance of the quarter. 
And then, we've been pleased with the results. I don't think that the changes 
that we made restricted our ability to earn. We weren't constrained in terms 
of capacity or personnel. And it was a good quarter.
 
Brenna
n Hawken
 
That's really terrific. And then on the seasonality front, how should we think 
about it just from a modeling perspective? Can you give us any help there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think it's a little early to call. I would historically tell you that Augus
t is 
generally been a pretty slow month, but we are seeing a lot of new trends 
this year that we've never seen before. So, I leave it up to you to make 
those determinations.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay.
 
James Gorman
 
I would just caution it. From my long 
experience of doing these calls and 
discussing fixed income here and observing our competitors it's pretty hard 
to model quarter
-
to
-
quarter every 13 weeks what the fixed income markets 
are going to do. So good luck with that, but we take a slightly longer 
term 
view and again, our base case is billion dollar run rate a quarter we think is 
what the business should be producing in this time and environment and if it 
does better than that great, and that's kind of where we are at.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Thanks. Thanks 
for all that color. That's helpful. And then, a couple on the 
wealth management business, nice to see a recovery here in the margin. As 
you think about this business a bit longer term, as well and you think about 
some of the changes that are coming, from a
 
regulatory perspective, how 
much do you anticipate your product shelf for commission accounts may be 
impacted? Could you give us a sense about whether that's going to shrink 
and maybe frame up how that might shrink and how that might have an 
impact on rev
enues, and then whether or not the uncertainty from the 
fiduciary rule is having any impact on the recruiting market from your 
perspective.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Okay. I think the way that I would try to answer that is a couple of things. 
One, as you said, we ha
d a nice recovery in the margin that was both driven 
on the revenue and the expense side. We are confident in our 23% to 25% 
margin target that we put out there. When we put it out there, we had the 
draft to the DOL requirements, so we were informed when w
e put out the 
targets. I mentioned we have been investing for the ultimate implementation 
of that new rule. And we also saw this quarter some of the streamline 
initiatives that are ultimately going to help this business.
 
I think we are well positioned for 
that change. We have the largest advisory 
platform in the industry. We are making the investments in digital. We do 
believe as a model Brennan that we're going to have that our wealth clients 
want advice and they will pay for that advice. But the ultimate 
mix and shift 
of products that they want and that they need is going to be a function of 
time. But we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow this 
business going forward, even though we have seen lower levels of 
engagement given the uncerta
inty in the market.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. And no color on the impact in the recruiting market?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
You know, I think attrition is clearly running low, and it's been like that for a 

 
James
 
Gorman
 
No, it's not going to be affect it.
 
Brennan Hawken
 
Okay. Thanks a lot.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA, 
your line is open.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Hi. Another question related to FIC. The debt underwriting year
-
ov
er
-
year 
performed the worst for you guys versus peers. And the question is, is the 
reduction in FIC on the trading side impacting the debt underwriting side?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I wouldn't say that Mike. I think our debt underwriting business has been a 
good b
usiness for us. We generally perform better from a quarterly 
perspective, particularly in markets where we see a lot of the non
-
commoditized that business being robust. In any 13 week period, 
particularly in low velocity environments, you can get some SKU 
if you are 
not in some big deals around the event space. This quarter there were a 
couple of events that we didn't participate in on the financing because we 
were on the sell side from an M&A perspective. So that will impact the 
numbers on a quarterly basi
s, but again, we feel good about this business. I 
don't think any of the changes that we've made in fixed income are 
impairing our ability to do business here. And we are focused on it and we 
think it's a good business.
 
Mike Mayo
 
Second question, retail cl
ients on the sidelines due to Brexit, have they come 
off the sidelines what are you seeing among retail investors now?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think Brexit is only one event. We've seen sort of subdued transactional 
revenues for quite some time if you remember i
t really started back in the 
summer when we saw some wild volatility in the US markets, but also in 
Asia and around the world. Those levels have remained low. They picked up 
a little bit this quarter. It was benefited from some mark to market in our 
deferr
ed comp. So if you look at the core trends they remain still quite low 
and subdued. So, I would tell you that we put a good quarter despite the low 

material pick up just yet.
 
James Go
rman
 
I would just add from watching this stuff. I would say the downside risk on 
the transaction revenue at this point is low. As Jon said it was very subdued 
in the last several months. The upside risk is whatever it is, if currency 
engages. So, I don't m
ean there's a lot of downside from this point, on 
transaction and we would just see how the macro events that clearly move 
the investors psychology pretty significantly through this year and as we all 
know sadly there have been lot of things in the news.
 
M
ike Mayo
 
And then last question, you had a good quarter, but still just an ROE of 
8.3%, I think I heard you reiterate the 9% to 11% target for 2017, so 
what's left. I guess you have $1 billion of targeted savings for project 
streamline. How much has 

general, how do you still get to that 9% to 11% ROE from here?
 
James Gorman
 
Mike, I think we've had this question before. But, listen, it was an okay 
quarter. I don't, honesty I think it was good in bids. The ROE of 8.3% 
against the standards that we were shooting pricing was okay. It feels good 
in this environment, but the 8.3% a
lso recall as Jon pointed out the tax rate 
was pretty high this quarter. And we had the preferred in there this quarter. 
So you've got a lot of things going on, is there upside from here? Obviously, 
we have a pretty concrete game plan on the quarter around
 
going forward 
around what we can do in wealth management where rates ultimately will 
impact the pipeline that we have in the investment banking calendar, and I 
think the broader changes going on in the global investment banking 
industry. And I think Morga
n Stanley is emerging from that pack if you will 
as one of the institutions that is strengthening at this point. So, but again, 
we are not speaking to the third quarter numbers here obviously. We are 
speaking to the outlook as you point out over next year 
and we stand by our 
9% to 11% by the end of 2017.
 
Mike Mayo
 
I'm sorry. Project streamline what you have left or what have you achieved?
 
James Gorman
 

want to talk about where we are
 
in some of the broader project streamline. 
But we've had, I described the wind so far as being largely tactical stuff that 


just let him talk about it.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thanks. So Mike, you heard some of the comments in my script about some 

best way to look at it is both comp and non
-
comp on the non
-
comp 
if you 
look at year
-
to
-
date results were down about $350 million versus last year. 
A good chunk of that related to these streamline initiatives and litigation. 
There is clearly a benefit unfortunately from a lower revenue number, but 
there is good progress
 
in the non
-
comp side. On the comp side, also a 
reflection of revenues, but as you heard, the ISG comp ratio year to date is 
36% versus I think it was 38% ex
-
DVA last year year
-
to
-
date. So good 
discipline on the comp and good discipline on the expenses and
 
we're 
confident that we're going to be able to hit the $1 billion target.
 
Mike Mayo
 
All right, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with 
Evercore. Your line is open.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Hi, thanks. One last one on 
FIC. I know you're not going to give us the 
number, but I'm looking for anything directional on, profitability must have 
improved a lot given headcounts down 25%, RWA is down a lot and 
revenues are now well. I wonder if you could help on any soft comments 
about overall profitability?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think you characterized it well.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
No number. Okay. In the past you've had a lot of seasonality in your FIC 
numbers. Part of that was the commodities business and you have since sold 
Oil Merchanting

comment the pacing of that $4 billion a year target goal, whatever you want 
to call it. Will it be a little bit more balanced than in the past?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think you highlight the most i
mportant factor. This is a volatile business, no 
doubt that we had incremental volatility given some of the commodities 
businesses that we were in, so we would expect less volatility, but again, I 
think we've answered what our goal is in our target for tha
t business.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay Jon. The nice drop in RWA in the quarter is down 5%. 15% year
-
on
-
year, but GAAP assets had actually increased, I think in your prepared 
remarks you said something about supporting client activity related to 
Brexit, but just cu
rious if you could expand on that a little bit, RWA following 
GAAP assets up more...
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Unfortunately, it's just math. We continue to make progress on our 
initiatives to take out some of the high, higher density if you will RWA 
assets. At the 
end of the quarter, we saw a spike as you said supporting our 
clients, a lot of that was in sort of low intensity RWA assets and that sort of 
drives the discrepancy there.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
Okay. So the trend of the RWA going down is what you should focus on 
an
yway. And then, maybe last quickie is two quick number ones, in the past 
I think the difference between your our ROE and your ROTC is in the range 
of 130, 140 basis points, nothing should change that right, we should be 
about that same spread now, just bec
ause everybody else gives their return 
intangible I want, just wanted to do apples to apples.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

intangibles and goodwill and if you do the math you get that 130 basis 
points.
 
Glenn Schorr
 
All right, awesome. Thanks Jon.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with 
Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Great, good morning guys. So couple more quest
ions on costs. The 
operating leverage in ISG was pretty impressive. Is that 35.5% comp ratio 
and remotely sustainable on a go
-
forward basis if FIC revenues are modestly 
weaker? And then, also if you can comment on any cost implications of FIC 
in the CCAR i
ssues?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

do have to resubmit by the end of the year. That will take some resources 
both dollars and people. I think it's a little too early for us to try to size that
 
and whether that has an impact on streamline, so we'll come back to you as 
we get more deeply engaged in that. We clearly have started to work and 
are focused on it and will dedicate the appropriate or required resources that 
we need to make sure that we 
are successful in our resubmission.
 
On the second point, I think the target that we laid out is the 37% 
-
 
ISG 
comp ratio year
-
to
-
date 36% I think looking over the total year is more 
important than any given quarter but we are also benefiting from the 
headc
ount changes that we made in the fourth quarter. And we do think that 
this is a sustainable ratio and that we will continue to pay for talent and be 
able to retain and attract talent going forward.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Perfect, very helpful. I'm not sure if I ca
ught this right, but on the cash 
equity business, did you say it was up sequentially, pretty surprising given 
industry volumes were lower just I was curious if you guys gaining share or 
any particular initiatives anything you can buck the general industry 
trends.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, you did hear me correctly. On a quarter
-
over
-
quarter basis, we were 
up. We had some improved new issue, volumes were up a little bit that was 
helpful and less volatility. So yes we were up.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay, thank you. And t
hen just very quick clean
-
up question, the trump 
redemption, what does that show up in the income statement?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
We announced it last night. We're going to call it's going to be, there are two 
different call based but by the middle of August th
at will all be gone. As I 

quarter 

 
just the lack of it in the third quarter.
 
Christian Bolu
 
But just from an income statement geography perspective, where does that 
show up? I
s that in the treatment revenues?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

$2.8 billion on a stack of $160 billion or certainly unsecured and then 
secured debt. So it will flow through that line. It

$6.20 we're issuing depending on tender issuing that closer to 3% to 3.5% 
at this point. The trucks have lost most of certainly all of their Tier 1 
treatment and most of their Tier 2 treatment and that was going to continue 
to 
phase out so it's sort of expensive debt at this point which is why we 
obviously redeemed it.
 
Christian Bolu
 
Okay great. Thank you very much and congrats on a strong quarter.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
And your next question comes from 
Michael Carrier with Bank of America. 
Your line is open.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Thanks guys. Jon, maybe first question, just on the capital ratios you see Q1 
up to 15.8, at least in the U.S. obviously at the extreme end. If we do get 
some opportunity as we get in
to next year that you get to release a chunk, 
when you think about where that ratio is, where your SLR is, and if you are 
able to release capital from a business mix standpoint, do you feel like you 
guys are where you need to be and the gist of it is if yo
u are able to release 
the capital obviously you will see one can come down but your SLR will be 
somewhat impacted. And then just wanted to when you look at the business 
mix and how you're positioned for that potential opportunity, do you feel like 
you are 
situated in a relatively well?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think despite, we clearly put together our business mix and our business 
model based on the best estimate of what the future is going to look like. 
We were very happy that we returned more capital this year 
versus last 

do that. As you've heard James and I talk about, we are expecting some 
changes in CCAR. We expect to hear something in this half of the year about 
how the G
-
SIB is g
oing to be incorporated into the stress test, how SLR is 
going to be incorporated into the stress test. So I think there is some 
unknowns out there in terms of which of these ratios will ultimately be the 
binding constraint, but I think the business mix th
at we put together is the 
right mix and if we have to adapt it we will but it is the right mix to generate 
9 to 11 ROE that we are targeting.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay that's helpful. And then just a quick one on the wealth management 
business if you will. You 
guys hit on cost and the margins, I think James you 

low just given retail engagement. On the flipside, it seems like for the 
industry we will see a continued trend and maybe an 
accelerating trend from 
commission based accounts into fee
-
based account. So just wanted to kind 
of balance the 
-
 
what type of growth we could potentially see on that side 
which is maybe more annuity like versus the more volatile transaction side 
of busine
ss. And then, for the advisors, do you expect any consolidation in 
the industry and probably away from your type of platform but to other 
platforms and then some compensation pressure just given the different 
models out there?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

o tackle some of the components of that. We have, as you know, 

-
based accounts. We are currently at 
about 40% of our client assets are in fee
-
based, the 820 which is a new high 
for us. We saw acceleration of those flows
 
in the second quarter. I think it's 
a little early to predict what GOL is going to do those flows. There is a 
scenario that would help accelerate those flows into the fee based 

plays out. We do believe again the secular trends and a lot of the driving 
force behind the merger, the acquisition of the Smith Barney platform was 
that people want advice, and they want and we needed to be of scale. And 
those are the two drivers that dro
ve that transaction and we're still of the 
view that that is the longer term trend here. So it's still got time to play out. 
We feel good about the investments that we are making around the GOL but 

from a client 
perspective and a results perspective we do believe it's a manageable 
impact.
 
James Gorman
 
And the industry will keep consolidating because this is a high fixed cost 
industry.
 
Michael Carrier
 
Okay, thanks a lot.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next q
uestion comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo 
Securities. Your line is open.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just I guess an 
administrative question on the trust preferreds, will there be any charges 
related to the calling of t
he trust preferreds?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, we highlighted in our fixed income call that on that redemption. There 
will be some write down of some amortized fees and we will take that. It's 
not a material number but there will be a charge for that.
 
Matt Burn
ell
 
Okay, thank you. And then in terms of wealth management, the commission 
and fee line was down about 4% year
-
over
-
year. Even though you do have 
positive growth in fee
-
based client account assets, is there a mix shift going 
on particularly in the fee bas
ed client account asset portfolios that is causing 
a little bit of pressure on the asset management revenue line within wealth 
management?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
It's sort of hard to parse through. I think the primary drivers are really the 
underwriting calendar 
and the subdued engagement levels that have been 
driving that activity.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Okay. And then just finally from me, could you give us an update on the 
energy exposure and whether or not that has had any effect on the reported 
lending balances in 
the supplement?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. So as I mentioned, better credit performance this quarter than last 
quarter. From a metric standpoint, we're down to about $30.5 billion in 
energy loans and commitments. That's down from $14.8 billion last quarter. 
Tha

characteristics of that portfolio are generally the same, i.e. about 60% of 
that is to investment grade counterparties, about 30% of that is funded. In 
terms of the mix that we've given histo
rically around held for investment 
versus fair value held for sale, the held for sale fair value portfolio is down a 

that we have made in that portfolio.
 
E&P also a good 
story there, down to $3.5 billion from the $4.1 billion that 
we reported earlier. So we continue to make progress in reducing some of 
our exposures in that sector. Just as a proxy, last quarter we took about 
$127 million allowance for loan loss. We told yo
u back then that a lot of that 
was being driven by our energy exposures. This quarter we took a $3 million 
allowance. So, clearly much better performance than last quarter.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Sure, thank you for the detail. Just one follow
-
up Jon, you've got abo
ut 40% 

was FIC results benefited from a lower mark
-
to
-
market on the energy 
portfolio specifically?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
As I said, about 35% of that portfolio is fair value held for sale
 
and that does 
flow through the revenue line item but I wouldn't say it was significant.
 
Matt Burnell
 
Okay thank you very much.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 

 
Matt Burnell
 
Okay, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question
 
comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is open.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Good morning. Can you give an update on the bank effort in wealth 
management? You have continued good loan growth this quarter, deposits 
were down a little bit versus last quart
er but still up nicely year
-
over
-
year. 
Just how you're feeling about the outlook for both loan and deposit growth 
going forward.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. So as I mentioned, $3 billion of loan growth this quarter, $5 billion 
year
-
to
-
date, continued good growth
 
there and I think we feel pretty good 
about that trend. As I mentioned, our NII guidance that we gave as part of 
the fixed income deck, we still feel good about that. On the deposit side, 

season. 
So at $150 billion, down $2 billion that was a primary driver. I think the 
investments that we are making into digital and some of the cash 
management products make us feel good about our ability to continue to 
grow broadly our deposit base and aga
in I think the bank strategy has been 
a real bright spot for us and we would expect that to continue going forward.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Just a couple of number clarification questions. How much were the mark
-
to
-
market gains on the deferred comp and wealth manage
ment this quarter? 
And are there offsets on the expense side or is that 

 
does not follow the 
bottom line?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Yes, there are definitely offsets on the expense side. It's generally the net 
impact is generally reasonably small, and we don't brea
k out that number 
given the relative size.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Okay. And then just lastly, the premium amortization that was a drag within 
wealth management, what was that this quarter versus last quarter or 
recent periods?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, it was clear as
 
rates drop this quarter, prepayment fees increased 
and that was the driver of it in the first quarter and rates were pretty stable. 
So again, that was what caused the NII to be flat this quarter.
 
Matt O'Connor
 

t?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
No.
 
Matt O'Connor
 
Okay. All right, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham 
Research. Your line is open.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Hi, good morning. May be we could just sort of dig into the RWA 
decline this 
quarter, I think you were down $20 billion, FIC was down $8 billion, so you 
actually had more outside of FIC. So when I think about high density RWA, I 
think typically that would be more in FIC. So just maybe help us understand 
where the RWA d
ecline is coming outside of FIC and is there more of that to 
go?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think the $20 billion, another way to think about it is about half of that 
came from credit RWAs and that was a combination of FIC mostly in the 
securitization area but also
 
from event. Lending, our balances are down in 
that business given the light activity. And then the other half was really 
around the market RWAs which is a function of both the balance as well as 
the stress bar which was down a little bit.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Is 
that sustainable outside of FIC the stress bar and those kind of drivers or 
is there more to go I guess outside of FIC? Because we know your targets 
are FIC I'm just trying to get a sense of the non
-
FIC?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, on the non
-
FIC the event is g
oing to be driven by activity level. So I 
think the RWA number that we used was, I don't even remember, in the mid 
350s and that number I think is sustainable given what we see in the 
outlook.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Okay, so it's going to be episodic?
 
Jonathan Pruza
n
 

significant changes in volatility. I think the composition of our book as you 
said we are making some minor, we continue to bring down our FIC RWAs 
but we made a lot of progress t
here, so I would expect it to be pretty 
comparable.
 
Jim Mitchell
 
Okay, great. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with 
Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Thanks very much. In this year's CCAR ex
am, it looked like your leverage 
ratio was under the adversely stress scenario, but I was approaching the 
lower bound and obviously that might be exacerbated a bit by the capital 
return although maybe there's some [indiscernible]. But could you just 
clarif
y how you're thinking about leverage particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory regime?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Sure. I covered a little bit of this in one of my prior answers. I think what 
you have to remember we are managing multiple ratios. We have the risk 
w
eighted asset ratios, we have the leverage ratio, we have SLR, how that 
gets incorporated into CCAR is going to be important. But I think the critical 
point to recognize here is we did increase our capital return this year and 
our minimum ratios through th
e stress test actually improved across the 
board, both the Tier 1 and RWA ratios but also the leverage ratio was up 
about 30 basis points. So we continue to accumulate capital and that's really 
a reflection of the business mix in the de
-

undertaken.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Okay. Thank you for that. Another project streamline question, are the costs 
being removed more or less coincident with the initiatives, or are the 

ident
ified, how many of them are in process and how far along what ending 
are we in in terms of the actual initiatives themselves?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think these are being 
-
 
these are proactive actions that we are taking, so I 
think we are driving this 
change. I mentioned the datacenters that we're 
closing, the workforce deployment strategy that we are implementing. So 
these are proactive steps that we are taking given the simplification of our 
business model. In terms of innings, I would say unclear. We
 
are in the early 
stages, we made progress and we are confident on reaching our $1 billion 
target in 2017.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
Thanks very much.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Not a big baseball fan.
 
Eric Wasserstrom
 
All right. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next questi
on comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura. 
Your line is open.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Hi, good morning.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Good morning.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Jon, I wanted to follow
-
up regarding some the questions on capital. So first 
on the G
-
SIB surcharge, it looked like as o
f year
-
end, you are right on the 
cusp of the 3% threshold. And given the reduction that we've seen over the 
last couple of quarters and many of your more risk intensive assets, where 
do you believe the surcharge is today and how you are thinking about 
mana
ging to that going forward given some of the opportunities not just to 
mitigate but potentially to even grow in some of the trading areas as 
competitors return?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
As you said, our surcharge for 2016 is 3%. As we said in the past, we're 
going 
to continue to try to manage and mitigate that if we can. And so if 
there are opportunities to bring that number down or change that number, 
we will obviously take a hard look at it.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Got it, okay. And then, one follow
-
up regarding some of 
the remarks you 

in the latest exam and that the Fed is incorporating as you noted a tougher 
SLR requirement, it still looks to us that even if we include the G
-
SIB 
surcharge in f
ull pre
-
mitigation that the SLR or leverage could still be your 
binding constraint. And I just want to get a better sense as to whether the 
mitigation plans that you outlined are still on track I believe it was at the 
early part of the year and the strateg
ic review on the SLR within FIC and are 
there other opportunities that you see to drive that lower given that that 
could actually prove to be the determinant of how much capital you need to 
hold?
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
Again, I think I tried to answer this questi
on clearly not as well as people 
had liked. Until we actually see what the new requirements are in CCAR, that 
question is challenging. We do have initiatives in place in fixed income to 
bring down the SLR. We did build capital on a leverage ratio this year
 
versus 
last year through the test how the SLR is incorporated will be a driver of 
some of the decisions we make going forward. And the buffer is as you know 
is on the risk weighted asset ratios, not on the leverage ratio. So I think we 
need to see a littl
e bit more before we can be more precise.
 
Steven Chubak
 
Thanks, Jon. And one follow
-
up for me on the wealth management side. 
James, actually at the Morgan Stanley financials conference, you made a 
comment regarding loan penetration levels among some of you
r retail 
clients. I think the numbers were 2% for mortgage and 16% for SBLs. The 
16% number actually struck me a bit high and yet we continue to see really 
strong growth within that channel. As we think about modeling out the long 
term growth opportunity h
ere, what should we think or what do you believe 
a reasonable penetration level that you can achieve across both of these 
channels to drive further growth?
 
James Gorman
 
I don't know that I want to try and put out a penetration on this be it loans. 
I actual
ly don't agree that it's a high number. It reflects the mix in the 
business as you move from single stock marginal lending to portfolio 
annuitized asset based lending. The SBL is going to go up and margin as you 
would think would go down, actually our marg
in book has been relatively 
stable, but the SBL is just a function. We have a lot of wealthy clients who 
have positions they don't want to liquidate, they want to invest in other 
things, they want to use money for lots of different sources and whether it's
 
purchasing assets or whatever, so I'm not terribly surprised by it 
[indiscernible].
 
Steven Chubak
 
That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
 
James Gorman
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 

turn the call 
back to management for closing remarks.
 
Jonathan Pruzan
 
I think we're good to everybody. Thank you. We will see you next quarter.

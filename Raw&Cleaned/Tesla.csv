7/23/20,Tesla,"Great. Thank you for taking my question and good afternoon. The first 
question I had was, going back to some comments you had made on the last 
quarterly conference call around gross margin visibility. I think if I heard it 
correctly, you 
basically said you had a pretty good feel where the fourth 
quarter was going to be about a month before the fourth happened. Now, 
given the sequential gross margin expansion that we saw in the third 
quarter, what update are you able to give us for the four
th quarter at this 
point? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
We expect to track to 25% gross margin in the fourth quarter, excluding Zev 
credits, so it's excluding the zero emission vehicle credits. Yes. I feel pretty 
confident about that outcome unless there is some 
forced reserve of that. 
Also, almost we were roughly halfway through the fourth quarter, so I think 
that's almost affected, so I think that's a pretty secure.
 
Then we will probably deliver more cars. I hope it was clear in the 
shareholder letter, but maybe
 
it wasn't, is that we really are production 
constrained not demand constrained, so we are working hard to address the 
production constraints and then improved the effective deliveries.
 
The thing that people still don't quite get is that we are different i
n a 
fundamental way from other car companies and it doesn't make sense for us 
to do things to amplify demand if we can't meet that demand of production, 
so on what we spent our time doing here as a management team is try to 
figure out how do we ramp up pro
duction faster and us to maintain the 
quality and keep improving the product. That's where we expect to 
-
 
a lot of 
these production constraints next year.
 
Jamie Albertine

Stifel
 
That's great. As a quick follow
-
up maybe, some of the announcements that 
you
 
have made intra
-
quarter and you alluded to in your shareholders' 
newsletter what is your sort of feel on the current assembly
-
line capacity as 
it stands today. Look like today versus maybe how you felt you three 
months ago. Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
The main cons
traint on our production is really is the cells, and I think I 
have mentioned that before in talks and I think I alluded on that on prior 
earnings call, so we were addressing the cell supply constraints and any sort 
of constraints that are non
-
cell constra
ints that exist, but the critical thing is 
the cell production constraints.
 
We announced the deal obviously with Panasonic, which is for a much 
increased volume and when we think about constraint on growth that's the 
biggest item that gets much broad atten
tion. Like I said, I think we will see 
some relieve from that constraint next year.
 
Operator
 
Okay. Thank you. We will take our next question from Craig Irwin from 
Wedbush Securities.
 
Craig Irwin

Wedbush Securities
 
Good evening. Thank you for taking my qu
estion. Elon, I wanted to ask a 
more philosophical question of you. We are hearing from different sources 
that the cost of your Model S drivetrain is more or less parity with some of 
the conventional ice vehicles out there, some of the premium vehicles in 
the 
market.
 
Now with the visibility on battery cost coming down fairly significantly over 
the next few years, when you look at the gen
-
three vehicle, would you still 
want to price that at a premium versus comparable vehicles where you 
would basically be be
nefiting from the ROI that you offered the customer 
basically less expensive gas in the tank considering they are not using, but 
certainly they will be using clean electricity or would you consider pricing 
that you more or less parity or possibly the disco
unt versus the conventional 
competition?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think as far as that we wanted to price the gen
-
three vehicle at around the 
$35,000 price point. When you consider the savings from gasoline, today 
when we consider gasoline to be at that point, I mean, 
is effectively like 
buying a gasoline car in U.S. for maybe $28,000 or a gasoline engine car in 
Europe for maybe $22,000. That makes it pretty competitive. And over time, 
we are going to get better and better at lease offerings with lower interest 
rates an
d just better access to capital with a track record and more visibility 
into residual value. I mean I think our residual value is going to be very 
good. But to get loads of cost capital you have to prove that and I think, 
long
-
term, just like with Solar Ci
ty, I feel leasing as being overwhelmingly 
the path to go for electric cars because it just brings the cost of 
transportation, it makes it immediate. Because you have the lease and you 
look at your amount you are paying per months for electricity versus yo
ur 
gasoline car lease plus gasoline car and then the gasoline cars also get 
inherently require more maintenance cost as well and with a lease you don't 
have to worry about like capturing a savings over some period of time or 
worry about the battery life or
 
anything like that. You just experience the 
savings immediately. So until I see leasing as being the main way that 
people buy a car and then its going to seem like a very compelling value 
proposition.
 
Craig Irwin

Wedbush Securities
 
Great. Then the secon
d question I wanted to ask was about the priorities for 
R&D investment in '14 and I guess over the intermediate term. Can you 
discuss the breadth of projects that you would be looking to fund and 
whether or not this is an acceleration from your prior plans
 
or if this is 
consistent with what you have been thinking previously?
 
Elon Musk
 
It's more or less consistent. The thing that we are looking at doing in '14 is 
expanding Model S deliveries worldwide, particularly into Asia and then more 
broadly into Europe
 
and as well as the other parts of the world. So it's kind 
of an international expansion and volume production expansion with Model S 
and then development to the Model X. It is just refining all of that, getting it 
really in place and building out a really
 
high volume production line, kind of 
next generation production line for the S and X. Next year, we will also be 
doing the design work with the styling, since we have the third generation 
deco because what we have done with the Model X styling essentially
, the 
fine brush strokes in the next few months. So next year it is going to be 
really getting that the line of third generation car done. But then it is going 
to take us a while to build out the capacity for that third generation vehicle 
and we are going 
to sort of selling battery pack capacity, maybe because 
ultimately when you produce 500,000 vehicles, from a new plant then we 
need self capacity that's commensurate with that which is maybe bigger 
than all the lithium
-
ion production in the world today or 
at least on par with 
it.
 
Craig Irwin 
-
 
Wedbush Securities
 
That's one. And then my last question, if I can squeeze it in. The Panasonic 
agreement. 1.8 billion cells over four years. My back of the envelop math is, 
if we are seeing 85 kilowatt hour Model S i
s probably one of the larger 
batteries what you are going to produce over the next few years, something 
like 30,000 cars, there has obviously been a lot of press coverage of your 
discussions and qualification of Samsung, I am going to guess there is 
increm
ental demand on top of that that you anticipate to have. Can you kind 
of shape that for us how you potentially see the ramp and how you would 
look for the staggering in these supply agreements to work?
 
Elon Musk
 
Certainly people shouldn't look at the X num
ber of sales over four years and 
assume that that's the number of cars that we will make. I think we will 
make towards the back end of that a lot more cars and so there needs to be 
other agreements with some combination of Panasonic, maybe with others. 
Pan
asonic is also our primary partner, but when it comes to the high volume 
third
-
generation vehicle it's clear that there is going to need to be 
incremental production capacity created at this existing look today, so we 
are in the process of figuring that ou
t and there is going to need to be some 
kind of giga factory built.

Bank. Dan, please go 
ahead.
 
Dan Galves

Deutsche Bank
 
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the 
kind of the current level of demand. We have seen it's apparently the order 
to delivery time has expanded over the last couple of months, customer 
de
posit, account went up quite a bit in Q3, and you kind of confirm that you 
are seeing demand increases. Can you quantify that all in terms of how 
many orders you took in Q3 versus Q2 or just in kind of a more order of 
magnitude is the U.S. demand continuin
g to increase? Where does Europe 
stand compared to where you were let's say at the same point in kind of the 
U.S. launch process?
 
Elon Musk
 
U.S. demand of regular van has continue to increase. We have actually had 
to stop North American demand in order to 
feed Europe, so if we had 
European customers they have been waiting for long time, so we have had 
to constrain deliveries to North America in order to get the people their cars. 
They have been waiting some cases two or three years.
 
I think, we could sustai
n 20,000 cars a year in North America, and maybe 
more than that, but it doesn't make sense for us to try to amplify demand if 
we aren't able to deliver to that demand. Basically we are happy, so where 
we are in Europe is we are still at the early stage. I 
mean, we are kind of in 
Europe where we were in U.S. maybe in January or February of this year, so 
European demand is 
-
 
demand is like from sort of it's on the order of maybe 
10,000 units a year, but again it doesn't make sense for us to try to drive 
that 
demand higher if we aren't able to meet it.
 
We want to make sure that we are laying the ground work for future 
demand increase and I think we could get demand in kind of Greater Europe 
to be similar to that of North America and it seems like that seems pre
tty 
achievable to me.
 
Dan Galves 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. Great. I just wanted to ask about kind of the production ramp. I 
mean, you said that kind of cell capacity or cell is kind of the biggest 
constraint. Right now, you seem to be addressing that. Where do
 
you see 
kind of production per week going over the next few quarters? Also, I would 
expect you would continue to deliver significantly less than you produce 
-
 
as 
you continue to have more and more vehicles on ships at the end of the 
quarter versus the pre
vious quarter. Is that correct?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean, as our deliveries to Europe increased and we necessarily have 
more inventory in transit. Then as we start adding Asia, but 
-
 
more in 
transit, we will probably have 60% plus of our sales going outside t
he US to 
Europe and Asia and across the globe as well, I mean, I think in Gulf States, 
South Africa, South America and so forth over time.
 
We can expect a majority of our inventory to be on the water or trains like I 
think over time and until that being a 
capital issue, I think that's probably 
not going to be capital issue because we can get pretty low cost funding for 
inventory and transit to customers. There is no question, unlike a lot of 
other products, these cars are going to customers, like to people 
who 
actually brought the car. It's not speculative as to whether they actually 
want the car. We are shipping them their car.
 
Dan Galves

Deutsche Bank Securities
 
Got it, and just one more quick one. I mean we heard this morning that the 
City of Beijing an
nounced that they would further constrain license plate 
issuances, but at the same time they would issue about 15% of the license 
plates they issue next year 20,000 units is going to be reserved for EVs and 
PHEVs and that percentage goes up to about 60,000
 
vehicles by 2017 
reserved for EVs. Do you know if Tesla imported vehicles would qualify for 
that? And what are your next steps in terms of getting deliveries started into 
China?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I believe we would qualify, we are assuming R and EV and ZEV. 
So I 
suspect we would qualify. We have our Beijing store which we have done a 
soft opening on and then we will start delivering cars in the first quarter, we 
are aiming for February but it could be March, but we are aiming for 
February. We have passed all 
of the China homologation requirements.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
That's right. The homologation is behind us, which is great.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So we have all the potential approvals from the Chinese regulatory 
authority to ship the car and we expect to probably ship out
 
our first cars in 
January and so they will be arriving in February, if things go according to 
plan. We will still be somewhat production constrained. It doesn't make 
sense for us to expand the scope of our sales territories too that if we are 
production c
onstrained which just amplifies the set of boundary that we have 
to deal with it, but we do want to get some cars to China in the first quarter 
and lay the ground work in terms of service centers, superchargers and so 
forth for, hopefully, a significant gr
owth in the rest of the year in China.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And despite the soft initial opening, we are seeing pretty good initial demand 
in China from the market.
 
Elon Musk
 
We are not really even trying. We are soft as, when we should say soft, what 
it really me
ans soft. We not doing anything. It is word of mouth maybe just 
not really anything beyond that. So, yes. It seems like things are going to 
probably go pretty well there, I think.

from Dougherty & Company. So, Andrea, please go ahead.
 
Andrea James

Dougherty & Company
 
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Thinking back to the cell supply issue 
again, and you have got this great track record of in
-
sourcing and building 
your own ERP system and the like, and I guess, can we assume that you 
have at least looked at building yo
ur own battery cell plant? I just wondered 
what your thoughts were there.
 
Elon Musk
 
We are not quite ready to make a big announcement on the cell and battery 
giga factory, but we are exploring a lot of these options right now and if I 
were to guess. I thin
k that we would do that giga factory with the raw 
materials coming in all the way to finished packs with partners and that's 
probably my best guess and that factory most likely would be in North 
America, but we are investigating other options as well.
 
Andr
ea James 
-
 
Dougherty & Company
 
Well, thanks for that. And what is that rank? I imagine, if you look at 
building a more mass market vehicle car, the cell issue would be probably 
one of multiple. Where does that rank? Is it in the middle of all the 
challenge
s you would look at or is it close to the top?
 
Elon Musk
 
The cell production is the biggest single constraint but I mean there are 
certainly many others that would one look at that on too far behind it, but I 
think if you look at say what's the critical ma
ss item it is cell production, and 
I think we can ensure that everything else is no slower than the ramp in cell 
production.
 
Andrea James 
-
 
Dougherty & Company
 
Thank you. Then just one final. The raw materials, Is that correct to assume 
that's not an issue
 
raw materials supply?
 
Elon Musk
 
Raw materials are not an issue. That is correct. I wouldn't worry about say 
lithium supply, or there is a lot of lithium out there and the main 
constituents really in the cell are, by weight or actually nickel and cobalt, 
a
luminum then lithium. Lithium is like maybe 1% of the cell in that. Maybe 
2%.

Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the new 
Panasonic supply agreement real quick, does this require a new factory or 
lines on their 
part or is the significant portion already covered by their 
existing capacity. In other words, how should we think about what needs to 
happen on their side to meet the supply obligations?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think as far as next year is concerned they got cover an
d we have been 
working closely with them and it was we spent a of lot time in a Panasonic 
batteries, As said, we have got high confidence that Panasonic can deliver on 
their commitment.
 
Elaine Kwei 
-
 
Jefferies
 
Okay. Great. The shareholder letter mentions t
hat you have accelerated 
development work on the X. Does that mean the launch might not be quite 
as late in 2014, and if you are starting gen
-
three design next year are we 
still looking at that 2017 timeframe for production as well?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think for t
he X, we are aiming for maybe a few units at the end of next 
year, but volume production is 
-
 
it's a high volume production is probably Q2 
2015, so high volume mean volumes comparable to the Model S at that 
time.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
That's the normal ramp up prod
uction as we while maintaining a very high 
level of Model S production in the factory, so these are very large numbers 
at that point.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Exactly.
 
Elaine Kwei 
-
 
Jefferies
 
Okay. That's very helpful. Just lastly in the letter you also 
mentioned that 
you will be starting production support to launch by Daimler in 2014, Could 
you just remind us what vehicles you will be supporting and are there any 
new ones that would under the consideration as well?
 
Elon Musk
 
The main one is really the S
eries B class which is going to be the biggest 
electric vehicle program in Daimler history and it's going to be a car. I think 
it would be the most compelling sort of four wheel electric car in the market.
 
Elaine Kwei

Elo
n Musk
 
There is 
-
 
beyond that.
 
Elaine Kwei 
-
 
Jefferies

Elon Musk
 
I mean, it's just particularly when you look at revenue helps supply 
constraints. It doesn't make sense for us to be finding new ways to used 
cells.
 
Elaine Kwei

Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Kallo from Robert W. 
Baird. Ben, please go ahead.
 
Ben Kallo

Robert W. Baird
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A good quarter. As you guys
 
think about 
what you have learned from logistics shipping to Europe and then looking 
ahead to next year, is there risk around that or have you guys got that 
ironed out as far as you are shipping to a different continent and delivering 
there?
 
Elon Musk
 
I t
hink, we have mostly got it ironed out with Europe. There were initially 
end number of challenges shipping, because we ship partially built cars to 
our assembly facility in the Netherlands. Then they can put it together there. 
We are actually ramping up ou
r investment in our plant in our Tilburg plant 
in Netherlands adding more and more capabilities to that and just making 
that whole process a lot more efficient. In addition to the myriad of 
challenges delivering it does in different countries, there are al
so the 
challenges with the electrical system.
 
So it's just the nature of the electrical grid that almost every country has 
their nuances, which you experience as a consumer when you got this 
plethora of plugs. We experienced that same sort of thing with el
ectric cars 
and like Norway is our highest sales per capita but one of the challenges 
there is it has a floating grid. So it's got somewhat unique electrical system. 
So it takes a bit of an effort to make sure that we are able to charge 
properly in Norway.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And overall, we had delivered zero cars in Europe in Q2 and in Q3 we 
delivered over 1,000 cars, and the first of the cars got delivered in early 
August. So in just a matter of two months, we could deliver over 1,000 cars 
which was a significa
nt achievement for the company despite the logistics 
that Elon mentioned several countries as well as different electrical 
infrastructure.
 
Ben Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird
 
Yes, I agree. I have heard some customers in different parts of Europe that 
have waited l
onger for deliveries and the rumor out there is that the 
shipping to hauling ahead of a tax reset, how do you balance situations like 
that and meeting customer satisfaction?
 
Elon Musk
 
It is tricky. In some countries there are some tax credits that were 
due to 
expire or that we thought might expire because they have not yet been 
renewed, as was the case in the Netherlands. So obviously if there is a 
danger of some tax credit not being renewed, then I think the right thing to 
do is to accelerate deliveries
 
to that country which is what we did with 
Netherlands. They then went ahead and extended the tax credit, so it turned 
out to be a false alarm but in balancing like what's the right thing to do, it 
seemed like the right thing to do was to try to accelerate
 
deliveries to 
Netherlands to make sure that people could take advantage of the tax 
credit. Now we are more in kind of a normal delivery mode.
 
Ben Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird
 
Great. My final question is, as you think about the battery capacity for Gen 
3, what 
kind of time frame, if we are building in North America, a factory for 
cells, would you need and then how difficult of a permitting process is that? 
And I will jump back in queue. And thank you guys very much.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, like I said, this isn't the ri
ght time to talk in detail about our plans for 
kind of a giga factory but except to say, obviously, we are acknowledging 
the fact that one needs to be built and we are looking at a variety of 
different locations. I don't think permitting is going to be the
 
driver here. 
This is going to be a very green factory. There going to be a lot of solar 
power. It's going to have essentially zero emissions and there are no toxic 
elements that are going to come out of this factory and we will build in 
recycling capabili
ty right into the factory. So old packs would come in one 
side and get reprocessed as new packs. So a way to think of this is like a 
factory is the machine that works for machine and that itself has a version, 
just like you have a version of a product. It'
s like a version of the factory. So 
we are trying to figure out what's the right way to do version one at this 
giga factory and we want to be thoughtful about it and it is going to be a 
really giant facility, like say we are doing that something that's com
parable 
to all lithium
-
ion production in the world in one factory.

y
 
Thanks, everyone. I don't know if this is a question for Elon or for Deepak, 
but I was curious if the third quarter, or even your outlook for fourth quarter 
benefits from any true
-
ups, some suppliers who might have been gauging 
you on production that the
y didn't expect you to do and you were able to do 
and we are hearing there could some potential for true
-
ups. Curious if you 
can comment on that?
 
Elon Musk
 
No, Adam. No such luck. Again, no such one
-
time benefits from suppliers 
that have been booked. So th
is is a clean quarter.
 
Adam Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. That's good. Could you comment on the wait time for car ordered 
today in Europe on average? I know it can vary dramatically by country, but 
maybe you can give us some examples of an order placed tomo
rrow 
morning, for example, how long someone could expect to wait for a car and 
also for China, mainland.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right. Well, bear in mind that from the point at which a car is manufactured 
in California, it's about six weeks
-
ish to seven weeks that it a
ctually gets in 
the hand of the customers, because we make the cell assembled car kit that 
then gets transported to Netherlands and get assembled and then the car 
and goes through final checkout then it will be scheduled for delivery to the 
customer. So al
l of that let's say takes six to seven weeks. Then there is a 
bit of backlog. So I think it's something on the order of three to four months. 
(Inaudible) three to four months, because there is a couple of months of 
lead time on top of that.
 
Adam Jonas 
-
 
Mo
rgan Stanley
 
And then for China and Brazil, we will add then just for your live launch for 
the Beijing dealer, for example like you had a couple of months on top of 
that or is that China?
 
Elon Musk
 
If you order a car for delivery in China right now, you wo
uld probably get it 
in mid to late Q2. I mean I would certainly recommend anyone in China who 
does want to order a car to place their order fairly soon, because I mean it 
looks like that wait time maybe accelerating. In other words, the longer you 
wait, th
e longer you will have to wait. At least that's what it looks like.
 
Adam Jonas

Got it. Elon, just finally, any update on when you are going to take that 
cross country road trip with your family. Everyone is kind of curious to see 
how that 
goes or you already done it and we just didn't see the production 
of it yet. Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
No. You would have seen. I have been looking at kids' schedules and 
everything, it looks like we might do that trip during spring break instead of 
over Christmas
 
holidays, because it's going to be pretty snowy and yes.
 
Adam Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
You don't want your kids in the car over there.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean just going through a country when it is like the shortest day of 
the year and it is mostly 
night time it is probably not the best way to go. I 
want to make sure they enjoy the trip. So I think I will probably end up 
doing it in late March.

My car is built like a tank. It seems to go through those Mexican concrete 
wall
s pretty well. So pretty strong build quality. Thanks a lot everyone.
 
Elon Musk
 
You are welcome. Yes, actually the pull through on that is actually it's even 
crazier than that, but the car actually sheered of something like 17 feet of 
curve wall, then went
 
through a concrete wall, (Inaudible) behind the wall, 
then it smashed into a tree. It's like holy crow.

Thanks for taking the call. I guess the first question would be, it looks like in 
the second quarter North American volumes rose about 250 units, 
sequentially. The third quarter, looks like they declined by 650 units, 
sequentially, and I know you hav
e talked about the supply constraints, but I 
guess the question is that do you think that we could be hitting a point 
where maybe the early adopters have had kind of been their orders have 
been filled and maybe demand is this leveling?
 
Elon Musk
 
No. I thin
k there is a huge amount of untapped demand in North America.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We saw a pretty solid increase in reservations in Q3 in North America 
compared to Q2. The fact that we delivered less cars is a not an indication of 
demand. It's just a matter of ho
w we mixed our production between Europe 
and North America, so we don't want to create any misimpression of how 
production happened versus demand.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, but we have said a [finite] number of cars that we produced and we at 
some point we have to st
art delivering cars to Europe.

encouraging. Now you are forecasting about flat fr
ee cash flow in the fourth 
quarter. So it looks like you will burn through about $50 million this year 
and, I guess, the expectations would be that CapEx is gone continue to 
ramp, I mean given the capital intensity of this business. So how should we 
think 
about free cash flow maybe heading into next year and then maybe 
even further out, just high level?
 
Elon Musk
 
You want to say anything?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We prefer to give 2014 guidance in a bit more detail at the next call but 
certainly our goal is to generate
 
a significant amount of cash from our 
operations and offset as much as if not all of our capital expenditures as we 
go forward. It also depends, to some extent, how much we accelerate 
development of new products and how much we continue to grow globally i
n 
2014 and we have big ambitions of that. So I think it's probably best that we 
hold on and give you a bit more granular sense of this in the next quarter.

Bank of America
 
That's fair. Sorry, go ahead, Elon.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, the general course
 
we are trying to take is to make steady modest 
improvements in our available cash while growing the business at a really 
rapid percentage rate relative to the rest of industry I mean these are super 
big percentage growth rates compared to you know what is
 
normal in cars 
business. So if we can we can actually generate a little bit of positive cash 
flow while having an ongoing very high percentage growth rate, that seems 
like a pretty good outcome.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And that's how we look Q3 results, considering 
how much we have invested 
globally in our infrastructure and our growth and we still generated positive 
cash flow. It is a great outcome for the quarter.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, exactly. Just like supercharger alone, we were aiming to have 
essentially all of 
North America covered in detail by the end of next year. So 
not by different cases. It will be some part like some people will travel will 
be potentially double or triple covered with superchargers and we expect to 
be able to travel anywhere in Europe or a
t least Western Europe and maybe 
across Eastern Europe by the end of next year. So despite all that and 
growing production volume and then developing Model X despite all that, I 
think we can still be positive cash flow.

That'
s very helpful, guys. If I could just sneak one more in. Can you just tell 
us what the effective the GHG and CAFÉ credits were in the quarter, the 
effects on gross margin ?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
It was really small. That effect continues to decline every quarter, J
ohn, and 
it was slightly over 1%.
 
John Lovallo

Bank of America
 
1%, okay. Thanks, guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, and our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Northland 
Capital. So please go ahead with your question.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Northland Capital
 
Thanks 
so much. Can you talk about the improvement in tack time and the 
elimination of overtime in the quarter for your production run rate ?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think, overall our production efficiency is continuing to reduce. So as a 
result, we are using less overtime 
and our cost per car per unit continues to 
decrease.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, I mean I think there is room to improve in our labor cost per car and 
we have a number of initiatives underway to reduce labor cost per car which 
we kind of need to do, otherwise we sim
ply can't fit enough people at the 
factory. So we will continue to grow headcount, but our headcount per car 
should get much better in the ensuing quarters.
 
Colin Rusch

Northland Capital
 
Okay, and then, go ahead. I can follow
-
up offline with a couple of 
other 
things. And then on the evolution of the relationship with your battery 
suppliers. Can you talk about how much they are contributing towards the IP 
and the evolution of the cell designs and new materials integration and are 
you having to contribute m
ore there than you would have thought when you 
started working with these folks a few years ago?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we are contributing a fair bit to the optimization of the cell for 
automotive purposes. In a lot of ways, the cell still looks the same from th
e 
outside because it is roughly the same 18 millimeter diameter by 65 
millimeter long cell, well it takes tiny changes like 18.3 or 18.4 millimeter, 
that type of thing, but the internal of the cell are evolving quite a lot and we 
are trying to be as helpfu
l as we can with working with our partners, really 
our primary partners Panasonic on that. I think Panasonic is doing a really 
great job and has really exciting things in the pipeline for future cell 
chemistry improvements and we want to bring those to fru
ition with them as 
possible.
 
Colin Rusch

Northland Capital
 
Just one follow
-
on. Can you just comment on the cycle time for some of 
those improvements? I mean, are we talking about things that have been in 
works for a couple of years just making the cars a
nd now or can you turn 
things around?
 
Elon Musk
 
Our internal goal is to make a meaningful step change improvement in the 
path technologies [cell] technology every roughly four years, so we started 
production a year
-
and
-
a
-
half ago, so one would expect in roughly two years 
there will be a significant chan
ge. There will be small changes before then, 
but probably a more significant step change in the two to three
-
year 
timeframe. I think the key thing is to have that step change in place for the 
third
-
generation vehicle. Of course I would have benefit to Mode
l S to 
premium line of cars as well.
 
Jeff Evanson
 
All right, John, we probably have time for one more question. We are going 
to go a little bit over, but just trying to fit one more in please?
 
Operator
 
Okay. We will take our next question from Patrick Arch
ambault from 
Goldman Sachs. Patrick, please go ahead.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to actually follow up on the 
last question. If I remember well, like part of the rationale for using 18650s 
was to 
take advantage of the scale that was already there when you are 
talking about building a new factory on your own, you are sort of bringing 
your on scale to the table, Right? It probably opens a lot of options, so as we 
think about battery technology for th
e gen
-
three might you actually rotate 
away from that sort of 18650 architecture and it is something that's maybe 
a little bit more compact and simple will be my first question.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think you are asking, it will be audit a 18 millimeter diameter and
 
65 
millimeter length just happened to be a perfect size of a cell. That said if it's 
a flat optimization there is no reason to go away from that form factor, so 
we are still investigating that we are not 100% one way or the other.
 
I would imagine though t
hat we don't go particularly far away from that size. 
We will either stick to that size or we will have something that's not hugely 
bigger. It's somewhat of a misconception that like a bigger cell is cheaper. It 
is not cheaper. In our experience we have ye
t to see a situation where large 
format on those cells are actually cheaper on a cost per kilowatt hour basis.
 
Patrick Archambault

Goldman Sachs
 
Got you. If I can, just one more just on, how you are going to configure your 
manufacturing sort of going int
o the end of this year? Does your current line 
have flexibility or will have flexibility to build Model Ss and Xs going through 
the same line or are you going to have to sort to build a parallel one.
 
Ultimately, I think the original expectations you put ou
t was 40 to 50 global 
units of demand for S. Clearly, that would probably at some point the setup 
you have now but just kind of wondering when that additional capacity 
would go in and how it might be configured?
 
Elon Musk
 
We have a game plan on that front 
because, obviously, if we are doing 40 or 
50 in Model S volume, if Model X turns out to have a comparable demand 
and we are on the order of 100,000 units then clearly our current production 
line is not going to do the trick. So we are going to need somethi
ng else and 
we are looking at reconfiguring a part of the factory, maybe using one of the 
moving production lines that's still there from the new days but I feel pretty 
confident. I mean it's not going to be any, the production of vehicle is not 
going to b
e constraint. That's not a limiting factor. No doubt we have got 
some sort of huge capital, training thing that's going to need to happen. I 
think we have got a handle on how to get there.

4/30/20,Tesla,"Yes. Thank you very much, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. I think, 
obviously, the execution look great, but my one question would be, just can 
you help us walk a little bit from I think your margin is adjusted 10% axe 
ZEV credits. It sounds 
like you still have levers to put to get to the 25. Can 
you just go through those with us?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think, Patrick, Deepak here. Our automotive gross margin excluding the 
ZEV Credits is closer to 13% and maybe we can walk you through later on to 
clarify. I know this is a confusing quarter with significant accounting 
numbers here, so we will just help you with that. But, we see clearly a path 
that gets us to 25% excluding ZEV credits given the actions that are 
underway and have been underway for a 
while and these relate to on the 
cost reduction aspects with our cost reduction roadmap, the efficiencies we 
have in our manufacturing and supply chain that are happening over the 
second half as well as a combination of the new options that we have put in 
the marketplace and the margin enhancement we get from there I am sure 
Elon has more to add.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right. Well, I mean, just in summary, we are about 12 points away from 
getting to the 25% gross margin target with our ZEV credits. And if you look 
at sa
y Q1, Q2, we increased eight points. So, obviously, on average between 
Q3 and Q4, we need to do six points per quarter, so we need to make as 
quite as big an improvement as we did Q1, Q2, but obviously, so significant 
hill to climb and huge amount of work,
 
but we feel pretty confident about 
the 25% number. And, it's important to note that we have visibility into 
these numbers more than ahead of time. So, the things that affect the gross 
margin, in order for them to, the fourth quarter really needs to be in 
place, 
we are essentially in place about a month before the fourth quarter, 
otherwise the parts that go into the car will not contain the [cost savings] 
that are necessary. So, essentially things needs to be in place next month 
and so that's not very far a
way. That's why we felt confident enough to 
reaffirm the 25% gross margin guidance [ZEV credits] for the fourth quarter.

Goldman Sachs
 
Okay.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Of course major event or something, some really big unexpected thing, but 
as lon
g as there's nothing really unusual that happens then that should meet 
that target.
 
Patrick Archambault

Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. Great. Then I guess we haven't had an update on the X and when 
that's likely to,
 
we understand that. Obviously, the variance of S 
or what's taking a lot of 
engineering resources kind of in the near
-
term, Deepak, maybe in terms of 
the X timing, is it still towards the end of next year when you are thinking 
about it. And, when do those engineering resources sort of come to bear on 
your
 
capital budget? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
I will may be do part of the answer and then allow Deepak. Yes. We are hard 
at work on the Model X refining the design. We expect to be in limited 
[volume] to deliver a small number of units at the end of next year and th
en 
volume production would recur in 2015. So, in terms of, if you are trying 
model it financially, I would model it more in 2015 than in 2014. Although 
we are on track to deliver University customers at the end of next year.
 
From a product standpoint, the 
Model X is our primary focus, obviously at 
this point. For the most part, our researchers are spending a lot of time 
personally on the Model X and trying to get the details right. I think there 
are some things we can do to improve the Model X over the earl
y 
demonstration prototype that people have seen. I think there is room to 
make it better.
 
So we are going to push pretty hard to make it better than what people have 
seen. I think this is an exciting feature as that, I mean that I love that, 
hopefully othe
r people like them to.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, I think Elon spoke of a key point. A lot of the resources acquired for 
Model S is in our plan and have done some expenditures and that's one of 
the contributors (inaudible) R&D expenses as we go forward.
 
Operator
 
Ou
r next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty & Company. 
Your line is open.
 
Andrea James

Dougherty & Company
 
Thank you for taking my question. I just imagine you have several options 
available to you now. I mean from investing in the Model S cap
acity which 
you mentioned in your letter to finishing up the Model X and then to 
engineering the next generation vehicle. I was wondering if you could just 
weight your priorities and tell us how are you thinking about it, both from 
factory investment and a
lso from your R&D?
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay. So it difficult how I am supposed to weight those things. So in terms 
of our expenditures, we are still more on Model S than anything else, on 
every front, including R&D because, bear in mind, we have got right hand 
drive
 
that's coming out in the spring. Then there is the China version and 
actually there's the European version that's tying in a note there. A number 
of nuances and there are a very few European countries that require work 
to, should the car operate smoothly.
 
There is the Japan right hand drive version. So there is just a lot of versions 
and especially maybe not so huge but you add them up and they amount to 
a fair bit of spending. In terms of executive time, I think the Model X is 
swiftly raising to become th
e main priority but it's not quite there yet but it 
will be soon. I am allocating an increasing portion of my time to that every 
week. Probably in the fourth quarter it becomes the top one, the top item. 
That's my guess. These are just somewhat of qualitat
ive statements.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
The capital expenditure for Model S will primarily kick in next year as we 
start to get some of the tooling place. Right now its about more of a human 
resource expenditure. It's design and engineering but not a lot of tooling. 
So 
it's a lot of lab work and design work but not a lot of hard drilling or 
anything. Yes, so that will be a fairly big chunk of that in second and third 
quarter and fourth quarter next year.

Dougherty & Company
 
When does the next 
generation of vehicle move up? Is it a timing thing? Is it 
a cost of the battery packing, the resources?
 
Elon Musk
 
You mean a high volume affordable cost?
 
Andrea James 
-
 
Dougherty & Company
 
That's right.
 
Elon Musk
 
All right. So there is couple of, here is 
the thing, like as we think ahead to 
that vehicle, where we are allocating a little bit of time to do some of that 
advanced planning. It's only may be less than 5% but a sort of planning 
activity. But when you do the math on, saying ""Okay. How many batteri
es 
do you need for, like what's the [capability], the raw materials all the 
elements?""
 
It's really quite a large number in order to ultimately [battery] that's 
producing 0.5 million vehicles a year. We saw it exceeding the entire laptop 
industry by a decen
t margin, so clearly new cell factories need to be built 
and we need to be smarter about the road shows going into Asia
-
Pac. I 
meant, I certainly see a clear path. I do not see obstacles. I see a fairly clear 
path to that vehicle. I have high confidence th
at we can create a compelling 
cog for around $35,000, compelling meaning a 200 mile range.
 
And, of course, there are a lot of other features that people have come to 
expect from Model S. Fewer things would be default features, so yes. I still 
feel pretty g
ood about it. There is a huge amount of work, but no miracles 
required.

Are Tesla shareholders going to see any benefit from the Hyperloop?
 
Elon Musk
 
I don't know. I think, so out of the question, but I think I kind of sh
ot myself 
if I ever mentioning Hyperloop, because obviously I have to focus on core 
Tesla business and SpaceX business and that's more than enough, but I did 
commit to publishing a design and provide quite a detailed design I think on 
Monday and then invit
e critical feedback and see if the people can find ways 
to improve it and then you can just be out there as kind of like a open 
source design that maybe you can keep improving and I don't have any plan 
to execute, because I must remain focused on SpaceX an
d Tesla. If nothing 
happens for a few years, with that I mean maybe it could make sense to 
make the halfway path with Tesla involvement, but I would say is you 
shouldn't be speculative.

Finally just for Deepak, what were 
the other regulatory credits in the quarter 
and does your [assumptions] include those in the long
-
term?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes. Our gross margin for automotive does include the other regulatory 
credits, because we have good visibility of those. They are locked i
n for us 
over a longer term. ZEV credits are the one which are not predictable in 
terms of recognizing sales and revenue by quarter and given their 
unpredictability we have deliberately kept that aside in our own projections. 
In this quarter in Q2, those w
ere up roughly $18 million.

Dougherty & Company
 
The visibility is better than the ZEV credits, because why exactly and then I 
will hop off? Thank you.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Because we have longer term contracts with certain car makers to sell those 
c
redits.

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is

Hi. everybody. Okay, Elon. I am not going to ask you any questions about 
cap raise this time. I don't think we need to go there. Fi
rst question on the 
40,000 unit annualized sales comment you made by late 2014 as a 
potential. What metric were you using when you were extrapolating that for 
Asia? Is that something like on a sales per store or percentage of 
addressable market?
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually it's just based on what we kind of see the demand as like. I mean, 
right now obviously we are selling in North America at about 20,000 units a 
year. So, Europe is a similar size market to North America. China is actually 
bigger and then that doesn
't include the rest of Asia Pacific, South America, 
South Africa, Australia. So it seems like that's a pretty safe number to 
assume. We are probably got some potentially upside from that number.
 
Adam Jonas

Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. That's clear. Just next 
one. Can you elaborate a bit on the nature of 
the supplier bottlenecks that you mentioned? Is it related to homologation 
for some of the exotic European or right hand drive tech deliveries? Is it a 
new issue or is it a lingering legacy issue? Any update on
 
when this could be 
resolved?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, this is an important point. We have production constraints, not demand 
constraint. Very often, we will shift also to marketing ideas and certain other 
thing but obviously I kind of spent trying to figure out how
 
to make more 
comps and the things that prevent us from doing at are supply of parts, 
essentially. 90% of our suppliers are able to ramp
-
up and 5% have some 
difficulty and 4% have a lot of difficulty and 1% just can't and so we have 
got to replace those or
 
in
-
source those items. You can't supply. Give people 
a car that's 99% complete, unfortunately and there are several thousands 
unique parts in the car.
 
So that's where we are really spending our time line, is clearing up those 
production bottlenecks or sup
ply chain bottlenecks. I think we should have 
probably cleared most of the amount in the next six months. Maybe into Q1, 
Q2, we should, certainly by Q2, I think with a fair amount of production 
potential. Then we will see what the demand looks like at that
 
point. But we 
are striving to become demand limited as opposed to production limited.
 
And I feel like we are actually able to attract, kind of the A team on suppliers 
because whereas previously we had some trouble attracting A team from 
suppliers because 
they felt we wouldn't be around long
-
term and we have 
that issue where IHS have predicted that Tesla would only ever sale 3,000 
cars lifetime of the Model S. Then we sold that in, basically, the first quarter 
of production.
 
So the tricky thing has been, a 
lot of us, as many of our suppliers have 
taken IHS number or taken like historical electric vehicle numbers and 
maybe given us a little bit of credit for our projections but not much. So they 
didn't tool up for the production that we actually experienced a
s we were 
scrambling to make up for it. So that's really, they just didn't believe it. So it 
takes some time to tool up and do it and then some inspired, a small 
number, they are just not set up for volume production. So we have got to 
switch them out into
 
outsourcing.

That's clear, Elon. Thanks. This is my last question. I think many people on

What do you think?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I am glad to see that BM
W is bringing electric car to market. That's 
cool. I think there is room to improve on the i3 and I hope that they do. My 
comments about other manufacturers. Yes, anyway. I really do encourage 
other manufacturers bringing electric cars in the market becaus
e this is a 
good thing and say, they need to bring it to market and then keep iterating 
and improving and making better and better electric cars and that's what's 
going to results in humanity achieving a sustainable transport future. I wish

Two questions one for Deepak probably and one for Elon on Gen 3. For 
Deepak, the first question I ask you to bridge on g
ross margin through the 
end of the year. Could you just maybe give us on the bridge of improvement 
from 1Q to 2Q, the big chunks of things that contributed to that margin 
increase axe REV credits?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sure. I would say the biggest pieces there wer
e stock cost reduction as we 
continue to get more efficient at our suppliers as well as some of the design 
changes we need to make the design efficient while not taking anything 
away from the consumer point of view. We also had improvements in labor 
and ov
erhead and our freight costs and all of those in fact were partially 
offset by the mix we had a poor mix in Q2 since we sold the 40 kilowatt hour 
cars that had the 60 kilowatt
-
hour battery pack.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Essentially saw that last.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Right.
 
Yes, which had a from a average gross margin perspective a negative 
impact, so I think what I am sharing with you is no different than what we 
have shared before. It's still the same levers and part cost is our biggest 
lever that's helps to drive these im
provements.
 
Elon Musk
 
Required parts, labor and that's what price of made of. And maybe another 
way to characterize it is like in the fourth quarter of last year, we were 
extremely down without making cars. In the first quarter, we were maybe 
still pretty 
down and we are slightly down in the second quarter. And 
hopefully by the fourth quarter, we will at least not be down.
 
Brian Johnson

Barclays Capital
 
I will figure out how to quantify that.

d? It's like how do we

Second question, Gen 3, two questions underneath, the $35,000 price point 
is that before or after consumer credits and tax credits? Then second, as you 
kind of think of Gen 3 and
 
making money at it, some talk I have heard that 
maybe it's small format batteries aren't the right way to go, but large 
format. Just maybe reiterate I kind of think the small format kind of where 
you are in those and how that gives you some comfort in get
ting to the price 
point on the Gen 3.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sure. So, the $35,000 does not assumes that the $7,500 federal tax credit is 
no longer available and there may be other state level tax credit so maybe 
other things but we are assuming that the 35, 000 
is without any subsidy.
 
Elon Musk
 
It's always helpful to have [some], but we are not counting on it. Yes. So, in 
terms of the sales format, for us, when we talk to our key sales suppliers 
and we ask them to give us the, say at the sale level what is the be
st energy 
density, so brought us pure down and what is the best price in we will 
dollars for one hour.
 
Invariably, the 18
-
650 format is the best. Usually buy at pretty decent 
margin. That's a 18 millimeter by 65 millimeter cylinder with yes. That's the 
for
mat that has to (Inaudible). It has advantages. I think why does it cost 
less? I mean I think you are able to kind of pack and why should that be 
done? To be able to compress and pack in quite a bit of electrode and 
electrolyte in that cylinder.
 
So, our ba
ttery is really a, like conservative batteries of like cylinders with 
double head, triple and that kind of thing, but you can pack more in there. It 
has a fairly efficient manufacturing process in almost every way, relative to 
the pragmatic approach. Also 
as you make the cell bigger, you have to say 
that the reject rates for the cell is going to increase.
 
So you think of maybe an analogy to the silicon wafer fab and say what 
would be cheaper? Having a whole bunch of say, six inch wafers or one 12 
inch wafer
? Actually it's the lower diameter wafer that is cheaper because, 
with silicon as the electrode area, you have to reject anything that's got a 
flaw. So the reject rate and it is supposed to help us make things in a limit.
 
So I would say, in a limit where t
he whole battery is one cell, the reject rate 
will be virtually 100% and then as you make the cells smaller and smaller, 
the reject rate will reduce and at (inaudible) that reject rate is very low. A 
very good statistical reliability. So I am sort of givin
g a long winded answer 
here.

Elon Musk

Brian Johnson

Barclays Capital
 
Okay, and then in terms of how you are managing the load, are th
ere 
advantages to having several thousands, I have heard numbers of 5,000 to 
8000 cells versus a smaller number? Again kind of thinking about the 
statistics behind it?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I think we are at around 7,000 cell number for the 85 kilowatt hour 
pack
. If we were to say, what's the ideal cell number and if we were to go 
whole new cell, like a whole new sort of cell plant, I think we might drop the 
cell number in half, but probably not less than that. The other thing that 
cells give you is that, for lon
g
-
term life of the pack, if you have a large 
number of cells, then losing a cell actually has a very small impact on the 
total capacity of the pack. Whereas if you have a small number of cells then 
losing a cell has a big impact on the capacity of the pack
. So there are some 
advantages for life as well and for our liability

Our next question comes from Dan Galves with Deutsche Bank. Your line is 
open.
 
Dan Galves

Deutsche Bank
 
Okay, thanks. Just wanted to follow up on the 40,000 units per year by 
late 
2014 comment in the shareholder letter. Can you tell us what North 
American order flow is on an annualized basis right now and what type of 
order rate are you seeing in Europe currently and what's been the 
trajectory?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So I 
wouldn't get too specific but, in terms of weekly net orders, new 
orders net of cancellations, it is something, it fluctuates a little bit from week 
to week but it's around 20,000 right now for North America. We are not 
trying to push it higher than that b
ecause it's kind of pointless to push 
volume when you don't have the production to meet it.
 
So I think there's potential there for, once we are where we have the service 
centers in more parts of the country and maybe more stores out there and 
more word of 
mouth and more Supercharger stations. This is not going to be 
the long
-
term demand in North America is greater than 20,000 units a year 
since we lack those things today and have that approximate demand.
 
Also, in Europe, we are actually not trying to push s
ales very hard because if 
you order a car in Europe you are going to get it get it in, like maybe 
November. So we really again need to improve our production. We need to 
make sure that the entry of the car into Europe is smooth, that people have 
a good exp
erience with the car, that all the service centers are there, that 
the people are well trained and maybe these are the really important things 
and then like I said, if you look at sort of supply and demand, EU or greater 
EU area is actually higher than Nor
th America in general for that demand.
 
So if you say, how many premium sedans are sold, more are sold in the 
Greater EU areas than in North America. So, to a read up, we achieve some 
of that percentage in Europe and maybe it's a bit less, because our cost 
of it 
more because it's got to come from U.S. and there is increased logistics 
costs and some import duties and that kind of thing. So maybe that's 
(Inaudible) assume it is going to be as good as North America, but it is 
probably at least half as good as N
orth America. And maybe it ultimately as 
good as North America, but I will consider that's why we say that half as 
good. Then China and the rest of Asia and other countries, well, if they can 
be half as good as North America, then we are at the 40,000 unit
 
number 
and so that all seems pretty reasonable to me.
 
Dan Galves

Deutsche Bank
 
In terms of capacity to build I think your current line is set up for maybe 
40,000 units to 50,000 units on two shifts. I guess two questions. When do 
you think you can get t
o that number in terms of production rate and what is 
the decision making process in terms of potentially adding more capacity if 
you are going to fill that up with just the Model S.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right. As I said earlier, while we have the ability to 
produce at the 40,000 
unit level all of our suppliers also have got ability, so that's the thing that's 
holding us back. I think, there is certainly room to grow beyond that where 
we have a big factory. Yes, so we will have to see how demand settles out.
 
A
s I mentioned, we want to get to being demand for traders as possible. 
Hopefully, we will get there next year. That's our goal, at least by the end of 
next year and there of course we will bring the Model X online in limited 
number next year and bigger num
ber in 2015 and the potential is obviously 
very significant, but our promise or I think there is lot of potential but we 
will have to see how it turns out.

Deutsche Bank
 
Great. One last question. You mentioned that the changes to options and 
p
ricing that went in maybe a week ago was going to be a benefit to margin 
in the back half. Do you have any sense of kind of how much it would've 
benefited margins in this quarter or do you have a projection for how much 
of an increase you will see from tha
t action?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We are really not sure, because we only introduced them less than a week, 
ago like four days ago, five days ago and we don't know what the take rate 
is going to be, but we have got some guesses, but I think there is no need 
to guess,
 
because we are in let's say a few weeks time we will have the 
pretty good sense for what the option mix it is in reality as opposed to just 
gas.
 
So, what we did with the options, we have unbundled a bunch of things, we 
added some additional options that w
eren't there before like parking sensors 
and improved interior options and a number of other things that people have 
been asking for is a subzero weather package, there is improved tires which 
come as default on the 85 and option the safety.
 
It's a whole l
ogical things actually and then new wheels, the aero wheels 
which improve range and give us actually by far the lowest (Inaudible) any 
car production. There is whole bunch of cool stuff and then we like to 
unbundled some things like the performance package
 
which required by 
whole bunch of things in addition to the 0 to 60 time.
 
Now you essentially can buy just the power and then decide if you want the 
other options. We are slightly low at the price of the technology package, so 
and to be clear, the base pri
ce stayed the same and the technology package 
cold weather package we also dropped in reference to our customers in 
Norway, because I think they called with the sub zero package you kind of 
need if you are in Norway. And so we actually dropped the cost the
re a fair 
bit.
 
You may have seen on headlines in the high definition back up camera. We 
made that standard equipment on all cars. So, essentially I think the value 
for money is actually better. But we did increase the price on some of the 
optional, the ext
ras that you said if we sold, we will actually make more 
margin on some of the things out there like for example the leather seats. 
Those were a fairly low margin item so we increased the price to make it 
more of a better margin item for us.

Can you guys talk a little bit about the introduction of new generation of 
batteries into the batteries pack. How much testing th
ey need to go through 
and how much impact do you think that can be on the cost structure over 
the next several quarters?
 
Elon Musk
 
We are not planning on making a significant fundamental technology change 
at the cell level. We are making a number of improv
ements at the pack level 
and then there is electronics and packaging and fillets [ph] that surrounds 
the pack. So the cell and non
-
cell portion of the cost. To get the cell costs 
lower, we are working with our main cell supplier which is Panasonic and 
work
ing with them to improve the cost of the cell and obviously the more 
volume there helps. We are quite optimistic about that relationship. It's 
going really well. They are a great partner to have, actually.
 
So I am not quite fully answering your question bu
t we feel good about 
where things are and where they are headed on both the cell and non

cell

Colin Rusch

Northland Capital Markets
 
Okay, perfect. Then with the purchase of the additional land around your 
current facilit
y, buying the site, how much capacity will that potentially give 
you if you build out on all that area?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, that piece land adjacent to the factory was originally part of the NUMMI 
facility. So when we brought the factory, it was actually divid
ed in two, the 
central parcel and then the north parcel that was mostly just land and a 
south parcel that was mostly land. So when we bought the factory and the 
main parcel of land but there were these two satellite parcels. What we did 
was, we brought abo
ut half, I guess, of the south land parcel and NUMMI as 
a whole as a factory had about half million unit capacity. So production 
needs to be slightly more space efficient than to achieve the 500K number 
or buy some more land. So I don't think buying that l
and puts us above the 
500K number. It just makes it easier for us to achieve the 500K number.

Yes. Already an issue in hearing?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Right, I mean I think certainly it's going to be fairly 
significant. I want to be 
careful about how much I quote in terms of percentages but I think it's more 
important to understand the physical since we have indicated in the 
shareholder letter that overall, given the continued emphasis on multiple 
product pro
grams that we have, we will see an increase in R&D and on the 
sales and SG&A side overall we are strengthening our infrastructure globally 
on a variety of fronts, so I would say from a trend perspective, the 
percentage increase would be higher than what yo
u have seen in last couple 
of quarters.
 
John Lovallo

Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. That's helpful. Then if we think about cash flow for a minute, I think if 
you look at just free cash flow was a use of about $79 million in the quarter. 
I think if y
ou make the adjustments that you guys had talked about I think 
$11 million for the DoE payments was of $67 million increase in receivables 
that may not occur. Is that looks like about used per $1 million. Now, you 
have CapEx ramping up in the back half of 
the year, so how are you thinking 
about just kind of free cash flow generation through the remainder of the 
year and into 2014?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
As we said in the shareholder letter that we clearly intend to cash flow from 
operations. And you are right in poin
ting out that some of that will be offset 
by our capital expenditures and we want to be very careful about burning 
cash. We want to be sure we are close as possible to a free cash flow 
position, but that's something that we don't want to necessarily guide 
to 
how we are going to manage it, but we are going to be still judicious and 
spend the CapEx where we need to in order to make sure that we are 
growing at the right pace.

within the other vehicle, but generally speaking volumes tend to peak call it 
seven to eight quarters out. Now you guys, sorry?

The traditional model doesn't apply for Tes
la, because that assumes that you

We just don't have that presence. We are starting here essentially from 
scratch and slowly increasing our presence and making consumers feel 
comf
ortable about what EVs are.
 
Elon Musk
 
Exactly. I think there is pretty long way to go. It sort of like a S curve of 
technology adoption. You got that is the sort of really early adopters, but for 
the mainstream audience they need to really see a lot of car
s that would 
work for long time to really feel like comfortable buying particularly when it's

Yes. I really don't think that that's going to be in anyway a limitation on our 
progress. It's a final assembly plant, so we are not 
dependent on parts from 
suppliers or anything. Generally when we haven't been dependent on parts, 
when we haven't had an external dependency, we have been able to get the

I will update is not in the hands of the others in the case Tilburg

Great. Then progress in China, obviously, Chinese market is a huge market. 
There is a lot of enthusiasm over there for electric cars. Can you share with 
us whe
re you stand on your order rate out of China? What you think we are 
likely to see over the course of next couple of quarters and if maybe you 
could update us on your eco plan for China?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. I wouldn't say this is quite the quarter to talk about
 
China. I think we 
might want to talk about it probably at the next earnings call in more depth. 
But I do say, China, it's a huge market. It's the world's biggest market for 
premium sedans. If you take something like, say the Mercedes S class, they 
sell ap
proximately half of all their worldwide production in China. Obviously 
if we were to ratio, have a similar ratio that would be a pretty amazing 
outcome for Tesla.
 
We are not counting on anything remotely like that. Quite the opposite. But 
it could be a pos
itive upside surprise there. You just never know. But we 
have one store in Beijing that we will probably open later this year. Then I 
am going to visit China obviously and really try to understand the market 
and make sure we are doing the right things for 
Chinese consumers and the 
buyers over there, because not every market wants exactly the same thing.
 
So we have got to make sure that our product is properly tailored to the 
desires of consumers in every market in Europe, North America or China or 
Japan or 
anywhere else. So we are doing a few things, especially for the 
China market. For example, improving the comfort level of the rear seat 
because it's common for people in China to be driven rather than driving 
themselves.
 
When we first signed the model as w
e designed it to be the big driver's car, 
really. That's how do we make the driver following up with car. And 
obviously if people are being driven around then we need to make sure that 
the back seat is optimized for an executive back seat that's more 
comfo
rtable than what we have right now which is like the family of back 
seat.
 
So those are the things. It's a little difficult to predict. This is not the quarter 
to talk about China. Maybe at the next earnings call. Certainly at the 
earnings call about Q4 is 
where we would be talking quite a bit about it at 
that point, I think.

Great, and then last one if I may. You have set a pretty interesting 
trajectory on battery cost over the next few years. Can you share with us 
ph
ilosophically whether or not you might use the reduction in battery pack 
costs to delay the sort of neutralize the impact of the Federal Tax Credit 
ruling off for your customers? Or do you see this possibly extending out 
beyond the timeframe where that wou
ld have the necessary benefit?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well you see the limit, the $2,500 Federal Tax Credit is limited to the first 
200,000 cars for any manufacturer. So that, between Model S and X we 
think probably that's going to get exhausted in the next several yea
rs. That's 
how we think it probably will apply to third generation affordable car. At that 
point, if it is possible for us to maintain a high margin and neutralize the loss 
of the tax credit, I think we would probably like to do that rather then have 
a hig
her margin car.

I had two questions. So firstly, just a follow up on 40,000 unit target. How 
many different versions of
 
the Model S? And in how many different countries 
do you plan to sell into to get to that 40,000 unit target?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well in terms of actually number of countries, it's quite a large number of 
countries because of the year. I am not sure of the exact nu
mber of 
countries in the next 14 or 15, or something like that. Then of course there 
is no way and restriction on the (Inaudible) Canada, U.S. Canada, talking 
about 20 countries right there and then the Greater China, Japan the trends 
of our important mark
et for us by the way going to take the Japan market 
very seriously.
 
I know that lot of car companies that don't take the Japan market really 
seriously, but I think we are going to do that. it was [it's] very discerning 
and actually I would consider it a gr
eat honor if the Japanese were to 
actually buy our car.

Got it. Okay. The second question was on the U.S. Market so, could you give 
us a little bit more color about your buyer base here and you know what 
kind of pot
ential brands do you think your customers are swapping out and 
who do you think you are grabbing share from?
 
Elon Musk
 
We hit some pretty good numbers for that. It's a really broad mix of cars. 
It's not and not just a premium sedan. In fact, I think we
 
Dee
pak Ahuja
 
I believe we used off that in our last earnings call that we shared

..it's a the capital raise
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Probably that's right.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
If you go back and look at our capital raise 
presentation,
 
Elon Musk
 
And we haven't go ahead and just talk about some of the cars we are 
replacing. Yes. It's a wide range of cars. It's not like you can say or it's been 
probably five or something like that or it's quite short right now, it's like. 
(In
audible).
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
This is from the ALG overview taking data from that bulk and they are 
showing sort of its various events and hybrids, so are the big ones. But it's 
interesting like we have got the largest one here is sort of in the order of 
10% and 
11%. A lot of people are buying our car instead of the Prius, but 
that's 10%. Obviously things like the E
-
Class are buying our cars there is a 
lead which also coming from so, it's like E
-
Class, Prius, lead the Highlander, 
BMW 5 Series, Odyssey Honda Odysse
y it's like it's 4% in the Honda 
Odyssey very like Model S (Inaudible) is 4%. Volkswagen Jetta is 4%.
 
Aditya Satghare

Lazard Capital Markets
 
Interesting.
 
Elon Musk
 
Mix of Honda Civic is 3%, so it's really a pretty broad range just from 
previous 
segment.

Got it. Now that's helpful and congratulations on the good execution this 
quarter.

Okay. We have time for one last question please.

Our last question comes from Elaine Kwei from Jeffer

Hi, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just now that you are beginning 
to ship internationally, could you talk a little bit thinking behind the pricing 
strategy for Europe and Asia? Just are there any adju
stments based on local 
incentives. Is it based on what the local market can bear and would you 
expect margins to vary compared to the U.S.?
 
Then the second part in there, the Super Charger Network has really 
overcome the infrastructure obstacles for long d
istance driving and does 
Tesla have any strategy for addressing any challenges for urban dwellers, 
especially in the international markets where that might be more common? 
Thanks so much.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. The Tesla policy is to try to make the same amount o
f money on a car 
in any given market. This is not a policy that, in fact we maybe unique in 
this. I am not sure if it is. I am not the [automaker] business, but we don't 
want to make but we don't want to make more money off of someone just 
because they are
 
in another country, so I don't think that's the right thing to 
do.
 
So, for example, in China it's quite common for as manufacturers to mark
-
up the cars in a pretty huge way. We will not be doing that. We will also try 
to be extremely transparent about our
 
pricing. So if you can take the U.S. 
price and you put back into your logistics and any import taxes and then 
there is a maybe a 3% allowable for exchange rate movements and then 
some incremental for any extra costs of doing business in that country that 
increase our overhead. But we try to be really transparent about that and 
keep trying to improve those costs every time. I guess that the overarching 
principle here is that we don't want to rip anyone off. So you should see in 
the same way in every country
.

That's great and then is there any thoughts behind addressing the 
challenges for folks living in apartments or condos where you might not have 
a personal garage? As I could see this especially being an issue for the Gen 
3 buyers e
specially.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, absolutely. It's not a huge percentage of the market that has the issue, 
but it is what is. Something we need to address. So for the biggest and 
toughest one is I guess street parking. A lot of cities and 
municipalities are 
putting in charging infrastructure on the street. So we are working with 
them to get more of that established.
 
For apartment and condos, for their garages there, we actually have loosely 
formed a group within our sales and service operat
ion team that is able to 
work with whoever is running the condo or apartment building and tell them 
what they need to do to install sockets. Then I think what's going to be 
important long
-
term, is the ability to load level or limit total electricity power 
load in an apartment building.
 
So if there is a lot of cars, you don't want to exceed the total power of going 
to that building at any one time. So you should cap a peak power limiter 
that's able to communicate between the cars that are getting charged. Th
en 
there are a few companies we are working with in that regard to deal with 
that sort of peak power load in apartment buildings.
 
It really hasn't been thus far a constraint on our growth. So if it occupied a 
little bit of our attention as that becomes, ne
xt year perhaps, it will become 
constraint on our growth and then its going to be more centrally in our 
attention.

That's great to hear on the international and infrastructure front. Thanks you 
so much you, Elon.
 
Jeff Evanson
 
Okay. 
Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing 
you over the next quarter and in fact we will be at Jefferies Industrial 
Growth Conference in Manhattan, next Monday and on Tuesday, also in 
Manhattan, we will be at JP Morgan's Auto Confer

that, and they reacted 
incredibly well. From a customer standpoint, the Model X was clearly a

Thank you. (Operator Instructions).
 
Our first question comes

Barclays Capital
 
Thank you very much, gentlemen. And Elon, on the discussion of the 

terms of the par
tnership, but in the past you have highlighted that you have 
a number of these discussions underway. Are these the folks that you had 
suggested could ultimately end up being a pretty significantly sized 
opportunity? Or should we assume that that is with so
meone else at the 
moment?
 
Elon Musk
 
Tricky question. I have to break that question part a little bit. There are 
--
 
this

I do expect that this deal will be significant and probably more 

e. And 

 
And then, are there other fields of significance in discussion? Yes, there are.

color in terms of
 
where your revenue

where you expect your revenues to 

going to be fairly back

half

weighted to the launch of the Model S. I was 
wondering if you could give us some color in te
rms of the mix of the Model S 
reservations that you have so far. In terms of running the numbers, it does 
seem as though you're going to be delivering on the high
-
end versions first, 

or 
ASPs for your deliveries for the year, or any color along those lines.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. So I do expect that is going to be weighted towards the higher
-
end 
versions of the Model S. And necessarily for the signature series which 
(inaudible) all the options
 
--
 
the first 1,000 vehicles. But then even beyond 

--
 

then we got to the 230
-
mile range. And then 160
-
mile range (inaudible) 

shift the weighting 
towards the higher

end version of the Model S.
 


exactly what options we will take.

around concerns on cash positioning (inaudible) loans among the industry at 
the moment. It seems from your prepared comments you feel comfortable
 
with your current cash position and liquidity. I was wondering if you could 
give us a little bit of color in terms of how you view that progressing through 
the end of the year and into the beginning of next? I mean, do you feel that 
with the trajectory of
 
the Model S at this point, you feel comfortable in terms 

 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I feel confident saying that Tesla does not need to ever raise another 


may want to do so, but importantly, we do not need to do so, is my 

the DOE is very good. So I feel pretty secure on those fronts.

Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.

Okay.

Yes, good 
evening. Jesse Pichel from Jefferies. Congratulations on the launch 
last week. Thank you for hosting us.
 
My question is, from a branding and strategic perspective, how should we 
think about the Mercedes brand cannibalizing Tesla products? And what 
keeps Te
sla differentiated from your customers in this particular supply 
arrangement?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, absolutely. Well, as you may have heard me say on a few occasions, 
that (inaudible) catalyst for electric vehicles, so we want to do everything we 
can to advance 

or cars that we help others make. And at the end of the day, if (inaudible) 

lend us to become more of a powertrain co
mpany.
 
No, I think that we do good (inaudible) and good powertrain engineering and 

by the customer interest really.
 
And then (inaudible) the new car market is something like 80 m
illion 


business away from (inaudible) business away from partners and nor are 
they taking (inaudible). So 

 

comparing say premium sedans or premium SUVs rather than thinking of 
say the Model S, the Model X is competing against this (inaudible) all ele
ctric 
vehicles which range from golf cart to Nissan Leaf, to whatever the case may 


an Audi A6 or A8 or again
st probably Porsche Panamera or BMW 5 Series, 7 
Series. That really tends to be the basis of comparison.

This is Peter in for Steve Milunovich. Elon, I was wondering if you can just 
give us some color on the range, the guidance range. Is that more of a 
function of Model S output 
or the timing of development services rather 
(inaudible) and how does that tie into your gross margin outlook?
 
Elon Musk
 

--
 
certainly the 
bulk of the 2012 revenue is Model S related. Deepak?
 
Deepa
k Ahuja
 
Yeah, I mean there are three elements to this, Steve. Obviously the biggest 

our own growth to sales that we will have in Europe and in Asia. And beyond 
that, we have the pow
ertrain components business with Toyota. And then 
some bit of development services revenue with OEMs.
 
Peter Christiansen

Merrill Lynch
 
Great. And then 
--
 
I'm sorry. And then I was 
--
 
I'm sorry. I was wondering if 
you can characterize the 
revenue opportunity of providing a full drive train 
solution versus some of your previous programs, notwithstanding a different 
batter size?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Are you referring to the Daimler program?
 
Peter Christiansen

Merrill Lynch
 
Yes.
 
Deep
ak Ahuja
 
The full

ability to provide to Daimler a much higher performing (inaudible) which 
includes the full integration of our systems, it allows us to provide a much 
more cost

effecti
ve and higher performing [ED] to Daimler rather than just 
our battery packs which is integrated into their system.
 
Elon Musk
 

customer experience, and everything is really optimi
zed with the other 
elements. And we demonstrated that for Daimler (inaudible).
 
Peter Christiansen

Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you. And just one last one, Elon, you just talked about the difference 
between needing additional financing or 
wanting one. And one would assume 
that could apply accelerating the Gen III program. If that were the case, 
what would be your thought process? Would it be driven more by the 
momentum and the confidence that you're experiencing right now, or 
possibly a res
ponse to some other competitive threats that you see from 
other OEMs?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I'm not too worried about competitive threats because the market is so 

--
 
any other 
company is doing but r
ather, are we making the best possible product? Is 
there anything we can do to make a product that is going to amaze and 

 
We are going to do at the next significant vehicle 
--
 
the 
next major big 
announcement after Model X will be a Gen III. And I made (inaudible) to 
some of the media, but (inaudible) reaffirming that. Previously we were 
going to do a next
-
generation Roadster after Model X, but I'm absolute 
--
 
gained enough confidenc
e that the technology will be scalable to higher 

-
generation (inaudible) pricing kind of $30,000 range. And if we were to 
accelerate that, there could be a (inaudible) argument for d
oing a modest 
capital raise.

Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Dan Galves with Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is open.
 
Dan Ga

Deutsche Bank
 
Good afternoon. I'm wondering if you could take us a little bit through kind 
of a near
-
term certification process or qualification process for the Model S. 
Just curious considering that you're still 
--
 
have some dies arriving in the 
ne
xt couple of months, what are the key bottlenecks that could come up and 
qualification? And what level of vehicles need to be used to qualify for 

vehicle or something with dies prod
uction intent parts from the factory?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Especially (inaudible) that before the dies are shipped from [Fujio] 
(inaudible) plant, they actually do send a number of (inaudible) so that we 
actually do get production body parts before the die is sh
ipped and are 
making (inaudible) with those production body parts. That way when we 


(inaudible). But th
e die themselves are sorted out.
 
As far as risks for production timing, yeah, I can provide a little bit of color 
there. Previously I set a goal we expect to be five
-
star on average, but 

-

y like we 
will be five
-
star in all categories. That is looking increasingly optimistic.
 
This particular challenge was the fifth percentile female in the passenger 
--
 
preference passenger seat. And just had a meeting this morning which looks 

ble to achieve (inaudible) in that category, which is great 

--
 


 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And I think (inaudible) timeline is on track in terms of the specifi
cation that 
Dan was asking (inaudible) that certification is self
-
certification and 
(inaudible) production (inaudible) and as we mentioned, the dies in [Fujio] 
are producing the parts which allow us to make the body and get that 
certification done. So, fiv
e
-
star (inaudible) suggesting that I should reaffirm 

-
star on

R&D factor, if you will, with work probably winding down on the Model S 
coming off and ramping up on the Model 
X, will you have additional capacity 
in R&D? I guess my real question is, would you have the capacity with your 

after the Model S is fully launched?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I think so. Tha

 
Dan Galves

Okay. All right, great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Patrick Archambault with 
Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman 
Sachs
 
Hi, good afternoon.
 
Elon Musk
 
Hi, Patrick.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
My 
--
 
I guess 
--
 
my first question would be, as we think about 
--
 
I think 
reading through here, it sounds like if you look at the R&D and CapEx plan 

 
model 
--
 
still Model S focused, unless I'm mistaken, 
right? I think the wording is that on the R&D front, by the end there is some 
X spending that picks up. How do we think about what that might look like 
both on a CapEx basis next year for, you know, whe
re I'm presuming the 
R&D and the CapEx for that program is going to be really at its peak? How 
should we think about that, maybe whatever you're comfortable talking 
about, maybe year
-
on
-
year comparison or a comparison of how it is visa vie 
what you spent o

the same platform. So, just helping the dimension on that.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
(inaudible) firstly, the R&D spending on the S should reduce in the second 
half, as we have said in the letter, not just t
owards the end of 2012. 
Because once we go into the production of the S, a lot of our manufacturing 
expenses, pre
-
production which are presently in R&D will move into cost of 
goods sold. So there should be a substantial reduction. And we will be done 
with 
a lot of the spending we are presently incurring on building the 
prototype and casting them.
 
So, yes, there will be some ongoing R&D on S as we look to bring out a 
European version or fine
-


ee a pickup in the spending at that point.
 
The same goes for CapEx. A lot of our CapEx is in the first half, is heavily 
weighted. We (inaudible) suppliers both for tooling and equipment. The final 
payment is once we sign off on the tuning and the equipment
.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
And if I think about just how those things trend into 2013, one would expect 
that perhaps you get a bigger spike in R&D than you would maybe in CapEx 
because you can leverage some of the equipment. How do we think abou
t 
that?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

specifically where the bigger leverage is. Our spending on the Model X is 

leveraging every elem
ent of the manufacturing factory, the platform, the 

--
 


 
Elon Musk
 
But you're probably right, but as Deepak said, just
 
maybe if 
--
 


there are in R&D.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. Taking a step back in terms of more of a product question, how are 
you thinking about sort
 
of higher mileage vehicles in your product cadence? 
I think at the Detroit Auto Show you had put up a slide suggesting it would 
not be inconceivable to get your cost per kilowatt
-
hour to I want to say 

ve mentioned the 
next
-
gen and perhaps after that maybe a new Roadster, but might there be 
an interim demand for an S or an X with even higher mileage capabilities 
just given the availability of cheaper batteries?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Well, just like that phrase
 

what the (inaudible) going to be. Well, you never know. It could be.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. And I guess last one, just I know you guys have reiterated thus far, 
but the four, but just to 
remind myself, what kind of IP protections do you 
have in place when you do these programs with other OEMs? What kind of 
restrictions are there to prevent them from leveraging what they learn from 
working with you? And doing it in 
--
 
doing something indepe
ndently?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Our relationship with Toyota and Daimler where we have these programs 

see any issues where this relationship is based on their desire to do things 
the wrong 
way. I mean we feel very comfortable. And as we grow that 

licensing and other opportunities to manage that growth. But at this time 

nships.
 
Elon Musk
 



agreements 
delineating what IP (inaudible) which company, and we really 

 

never really even been a point of contention amazin


necessarily have to be the ones manufacturing (inaudible) want to do that, 
then we can license the IP. And at a certain volume, like getting 100,000 
units or someth
ing, that makes a lot of sense.
 
So (inaudible) model in that sense. But yes. I should say (inaudible) able to 
hear what (inaudible) but the 
--
 
I think the (inaudible) card is going to be 

(inaudible).

Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Himanshu Patel with 
JPMorgan. Your line is open.
 
Himanshu Pat
el 

 
JPMorgan
 
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. A few questions. Just I wanted to clarify on the 
R&D, you did $208 million in full
-
year 2011. You're sort of indicating about a 
$70 million annualized reduction from the sort of falloff on Model S and 
Fremont
-
related
 
costs. Kind of gets you to a run rate of $138 million, and 
then you're kind of indicating some uptick from there related to the Model X 
in the second half. I guess, could you just simplify all of this and just give us 
a 2012 R&D number that you're thinkin
g? And then also what 
--
 
any sort of 
dimensioning you can do on sort of just the run rate of that number 
prospectively, either in absolute terms or as a percentage of sales?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

 
just 
adding a lot more people in our manufacturing facility. And as we indicated 

-

cars, and then when you add in
 
a bit of Model X. I think we are specifically 
not giving a guidance, but giving you sufficient granularity and trend here 
that I'm sure you can work it out reasonably well in your model.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
But Deepak, I just wanted to be clear, it 



like another reduction happening from just the kind of turning off, if you will
, 
of elevated costs related to the Model S launch and the Fremont factory. My 
understanding was the $15 million to $20 million per quarter reduction 
which was kind of the genesis of my $70 million annualized comment, is that 
related to the latter or the fo
rmer?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
The former.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
I see. How much of 
--
 

--
 

entirely, they just kind of get reallocated from R&D into cost of goods sold?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JP
Morgan
 
Okay. And is there a reduction, sort of an overall cost reduction in the 
corporation regardless of where it gets [binned] on the P&L. Just related to 
the fact that the Model S development is behind you, you indicated that the 
X is going to be consid
erably lower cost, presuming a lot of the costs related 
to getting Fremont now may have been hitting the R&D line as well. What is 

side on the P&L?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah, there is
 
a reduction related to that, you're absolutely right, and that 
will be partially offset by some spending in X that we talked about. There are 
some cannibalization there which is we have a sense of it but it depends on 
how our spending goes by quarter. So 


can 
--
 
I think when you run the models, you come somewhere there.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Two hundred for this year?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. And then the next question is just the Roadster, what is the long
-
term 
plan for that? Will that be reincarnated at some stage or is this just kind of 
being 
--
 
going into sunset forever?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, with the Roadster, fir
st version Roadster, was really to create a real 



volume at 2,500. There will be at 
some point a new
-
generation Roadster, but from my earlier comments, 

-

out probably about four years or so.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
And then, Elo
n, just kind of going back to one of the earlier questions, 

kilowatt
-


uff you're working on right now that 

--
 

actually get there. Can you just mention for us how much of that kind of 
$200 per kilowatt
-
hour number is sort of in the bag from the enginee
ring 
efforts that you can see and know that the organization has pretty good 

exactly how you're doing it but you sort of know over time that will happen?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I'm not s


have. I do think that cost per kilowatt
-
hour at the [cell] level will decline 
below that, below $200 in the not
-
too
-
distant fu

--
 

--
 

(inaudible) cost at the pack (inaudible) systems and 
--
 
are included.
 
So, obviously the cost per kilowatt
-
hour of the battery pack is a higher 
propr

where it is at any given point in time.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. Maybe just one last question, what was the kind of thought process on 
opening up the reservation book for the X a
t this moment, or would you 
--
 
I 

some cannibalization of S volumes?
 
Elon Musk
 

would be some cannibalization
 
of the S. In fact, the opposite occurred. 


that that actually is complementary. Kind of like you go into a
 

kind of better if the store sells pants and shorts, not just being a shorts 

 
I think people saw the press and pictures of the X and then some of them 
came to the website and said, well, X was really cool,
 
but I prefer a sedan, 


--
 

complementary, not competitive.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. Thank you.

Next question is from Andrea James with Dougherty & Co. Your line is open.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Co.
 
Hi there.
 
Elon Musk
 
Hi, Andrea.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Co.
 
So what needs to happen before you can offer a test drive o
n the Model S to 
a customer? And I guess, what seems to be the position of those first 5,000 
customers? Will they all need to test drive or will some be happy to take 
delivery without that?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think the assumption of customers is that 


be a few that want to do that, but my sense is, in talking to those 
customers, really is that they just want the car as soon as possible.
 
In terms of tes
t drives, we have to wait until the car is fully (inaudible) and 


able to take a test drive.
 
Deepak
 
Ahuja
 

customer who wants so a test drive before (inaudible) that should not be a 
problem at all.
 
Elon Musk
 

the 

--
 
should probably take delivery and then sell it, because I expect that the cars 
will sell for more than the [nominal class].
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Co.
 
Okay. So it sounds like 
from your view, given the choice of delivering a car 
to a customer or setting that car aside for test drive, you would just do the 
delivery?
 
Elon Musk
 

--
 
lock
-
in cars that are de

delivered to (inaudible) customers.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Co.
 
Okay. And then moving on just Toyota, how has your communication gone 
with them, as far as them saying this is what we need and whe
n, and do 
they give you hard targets or moving targets? And also just, you know, you 
said you're going to do a shipment in Q2. Is that in line with the rev recs on 
that contract? Thank you.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Toyota, as you can imagine, has very established proc
esses and systems. So 
they 
--
 
and they have suppliers globally. So they have a fairly stable 
production plan which they share with us in advance. So have full clarity and 
visibility of what they need. And clearly the components that we will supply 
to them 

those components like any other supplier.

Stanley.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Thanks, Matthew. Good evening guys.
 
Elon Musk
 
Hey, Adam.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 

first chance to drive the Model S also coincide with deliveries to 
customers in 
the middle of the year or would there be an opportunity before?
 
Elon Musk
 

--
 
I mean we (inaudible) 
before we get it to any auto/motor journalist to test drive.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Un
derstood. Deepak, in 2011, it looks like your cash was just under negative 
$300 million or $290 million. Can you at this point confirm, given the 
assumption of 5,000 in its deliveries of the Model S, that cash earned in 
2012 should be significantly less th
an this amount, or still negative but less 
negative?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, it will be. Our cash flow from operations here, clearly we have 
reservations in play as well as working capital needs, and in our case as we 
ramp up, we can have some benefits in 
working capital given the difference 
in payments to our suppliers versus payments that we collect from our 

 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Great. Just a follow
-
on, the CapEx outlook, the $200 million to $220 million
, 
any rough split of how much of that is related to final spending on the Model 
S versus early spending on the Model X or the other buckets which include 
retail or development work or early Gen III? Any idea of a roughly split?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Well, we have, 
as you clearly said, we have the buckets of spending on 
putting new stores out there, service centers. We are also going to do some 
super
-
charging installations, as Elon mentioned, and then spending on the X. 

 

that gives you enough granularity.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 


e
arly data, but how does the reservation amount compare to the roughly 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I guess you may be getting into that average because we collect $40,000 on 
the signature series and 5,0
00 on general production. We have a 
combination of signature and general production reservations on the X. I 

-

substantial signature reservations, no doubt about that.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Mo
rgan Stanley
 
For the X?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
For the X, yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Excuse me. Yeah.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
And presuming with the order of magnitude difference on the upfront 
reservation for signature X would be comparable to a signature S versus th
e 
higher batter non
-
signature S?
 
Elon Musk
 


X. And the $5,000 number is (inaudible) of the configuratio
n of the Model S.
 
Adam Jonas

Understood. Okay. Thanks very much.

Hi, good afternoon, guys. A lot of 
attention is being paid on the number of 

there at the manufacturing plant and you're still stamping some parts with 

r best
-
case 
scenario, but is that an option you would have to meet your delivery 
timeline?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

possibility. We expect just (inaudible) the dies if not all of them to be here 
by earl
y Q2, which is enough time to fine
-
tune them and use them for the 
production [card].
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 

get the dies?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

 
Ben 
Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Okay.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We could always have a lot of possible (inaudible) while the die is coming, 

 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Okay. And could you talk about how you get to the 10,000 to 15,000 
d
elivery number outlook for 2014?
 
Elon Musk
 
For the Model X?
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Yeah, for the Model X.
 
Elon Musk
 

-
and
-
a
-
half to three
-
quarters of 
Model S. And it could be higher than that. I mean I 
--
 
I t
hink this, based on 


--
 
I think it probably will be higher than that. So (inaudible) 

--
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Maybe should put it as a good conservative projec
tion.
 
Elon Musk
 
I would say conservative projection, yeah.
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Okay, great. And then actually finally, could you just talk about your five
-

-
star 
rating before the car
s get actually sold, is that correct? It sounds like that 
could come after you start marketing the cars.
 
Elon Musk
 

-
star 
rating and then it is officially awarded at some point after 
start of 

be, yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

-
star rating to 

 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

 
Elon Musk
 
No, no, absolutely. Really our goal with the Model S was to create the safest 
car on the road. To be the safest car on the road, you really 
--
 
you want to 
aspire to have five
-
star in every cat

-
star 

-
star to achieve the highest possible 
safety rating.
 
Ben Kallo

Operator
 
Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Cart
er Driscoll with 
Capstone. Your line is open.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Good afternoon, gentlemen. First question is around potential financing 
options. Obviously maybe not quite as relevant for the S or the X but maybe 
you could talk about wh
at you're attempting to line up for more of the mass 
market Gen III vehicle?
 
Elon Musk
 

options that people are used to seeing for cars. And probably working with a 
number of large fin

very promising talks. And yeah, we definitely want to make sure that the 
cars are as affordable as possible.
 

the leasing si
de is going to be greater than on the [production] side, which 

system on a lease basis because people come in, compare that correctly 

ies. And since the cost of 

talking about an order of magnitude difference. By leasing the car and 
adding that cost to electricity versus 
--
 
compared with leased cost with 
gaso
line car and the (inaudible) gasoline which is likely to be increasingly 
expensive, the value proposition to customers on purely economic level is 
going to be that much more compelling.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 

as kind of driving at is in terms of the volatility 
of the residual value and using a much more constant coop power [ph] price 
nationally than certainly differences regionally in gasoline prices.
 
My next question is maybe you could, in your own opinion, El
on or Deepak, 
talk about the different model options you expect people to take in the 
different models or maybe even compare and contrast the Model S versus 
the X, and so we could kind of drill down into what you think an ASP might 
look like, a final ASP m
ight look like, and not necessarily just the base price, 
at least your best guess?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think Elon sort of answered that at a higher level in one of the earlier 
questions that initially we will have the signature series which 300, or the 85 
kilow
att
-

-
hour 

we expect to have a fairly significant database given the specs on that. So, 
between that and the options, we
 

a $10,000 to $15,000 pickup above the base price, which is really normal in 
the premium segment.
 
And then in 2012 it becomes a mix of sales 
--
 
or 2013 rather, becomes a 
mix of sales in Asia and Europe. The prici
ng structures are different and the 

2013, and I will provide more granularity, but I think 2012 is fairly clear 
given our plans of launching the different series [for a time].
 
E
lon Musk
 
Okay, just keeping an eye on the time here, we probably have time for 
questions for maybe one more analyst. So, operator, just one more please?

The next question then comes from Michael Lew with Needham. Your line is 
open.
 
Pardon me. 
One moment please.
 
Okay, thank you. And I'm sorry, Michael, your line is open now.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co.
 
Okay. Thank you and good afternoon in California.
 
You had mentioned other potential supply agreements in partnerships in the 
pipeline, and I real
ize Daimler and Toyota are solid partners, but could you 
give us a sense of how many other ongoing powertrain development 
discussions are going on with other automakers and are they for more 
mainstream vehicles or luxury
-
type of offerings?
 
Elon Musk
 
I'm so

 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co.
 
Okay. And also just 
--
 
wanted to follow up on your comments regarding a 
Gen III mainstream model. Would this be an EV targeted more at the 
emerging markets like say China or a broader
-
base
d type of offering?
 
Elon Musk
 
It would be targeted worldwide. Certainly includes China. Well, I mean I 


--
 
in fact we expec
t to 
be selling the Model S and the Model X in China.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co.
 
Okay.
 
Elon Musk
 

--
 
we think that there could be a lot of appeal, interestingly, 
for the Model X, in China. So, yeah.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co.
 
Okay. Also re
garding your prior comments on sales 
--
 
cost reductions from 
the current kilowatt
-
hour pricing. How much 
--
 
would it be sort of scale
-
driven versus a material change driven? Like what would be the split on 
that?
 
Elon Musk
 
A few question, even 
without any material changes (inaudible) scale, you 
can get a kind chemistry below (inaudible) kilowatt
-

--
 
I 
think you will see material changes over time that amplify that opportunity.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co.
 
And how long would it tak

-

existing model at that time?
 
Elon Musk
 

because you have to implement
 


very rapidly bring that to full
-
scale production. Plus you have to assess 
things like calendar life degradation and particularly as well
 
as cycle life 
degradation. So you tend to see [self
-
chemistry] changes coming from a few 



mplement a new chemistry every year. I think 

years, something like that.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co.
 
Okay, got it. Thank you.
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay.
 
Operator
 

call back to our presenters for any concluding 
remarks.
 
Jeff Evanson
 
Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of 
you over the coming weeks as we attend conference. In particular we will be 
at the Jefferies Growth Conference n
ext week in New York City. And the 
week after that, we will be at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and 
Telecom Conference in San Francisco. So we look forward to seeing many of 
you at those events. Thank you. Goodb

Our first question comes from Ben Schuman from Pacific Crest Securities. 
Your line is open.
 
Ben Schuman

Hey guys. Thanks for taking the call and congratulations on the great 
delivery and results in the quarter.
 
E
lon Musk
 
Thanks.
 
Ben Schuman

Pacific Crest Securities
 
I guess my first question is around the ZEV credits, you disclose the amount 
of revenue in Q1, can you say how much is implied in the Q2 gross margin 
guidance and kind of its part of that what are som
e of the big gross margin 
drivers to get from that 5% level now, excluding the ZEV revenue to 25% 
and do you expect that 25% of those without whatever positive impact from 
the lease accounting that you might see?
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay. There is like few questions
 

in the credit revenue for Q2 and then probably fairly significant decline in Q3 


 
I mean, it might be some ZEV credit revenue in Q4, 



 


 
Ben Schuman 
-
 
Pacific Crest Securities
 
Okay. So bigger the plant in Q3 than in Q2, is it fair to say that?
 
Elon Musk
 
Oh sure, of course yeah.
 
Ben Sc
human 
-
 
Pacific Crest Securities
 
Okay and then just one more from me, the $200 million in CapEx, can you 

margin improvement might be tied to additional capital expenditures?
 
Deepak Ahu
ja
 
Ben, Deepak here. Clearly some of the CapEx is related to improvements 

-
house by bringing more equipment in and automating our 
processes, better results in gross margin improvement. And a portion of that 
is also new product development an
d then another portion is the 
infrastructure development of the service centers, our stores and the 
Supercharger network.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. I think it's worth noting that in probably Q1, despite actually spending 
quite a lot of money on new service centers, 
expanding Supercharger 
network stores and other things that obviously we don't need to keep doing 

 
that's something that's going to need to occur on an ongoing basis, but 
really test this out. We need to establish a service network and in particular 
the c
ompany.
 
Ben Schuman

Pacific Crest Securities
 
Great. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Deutsche Bank. Your line is 
open.
 
Dan Galves 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks for taking my questions. First one again kind of 
regarding the gross 
margin, I did I think the same simple math that Ben did to get to 
somewhere in the 5% to 6% gross margin, automotive gross margin 
excluding the ZEV credits. If that's in the ballpark, it seems like you need to 
increase gross profit per 
unit by something in the $17,000 to $19,000 per 
unit by the end of the year. I was wondering if you could give us kind of the 
big buckets that you're targeting for that improvement, and how much is 
within your control and how much might be 

 
you might need
 
price 
concessions from your suppliers, if any?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. It's worth noting that when you see the gross margin for Q1, we're 
giving you obviously the gross margin average over the quarter. And so the 
gross margin at the end of Q1 was significantly be
tter than at the beginning 
of Q1. So you may still think of we're starting from a base of 5% or 6%, but 
actually we're starting from a base that's better than that. And then in terms 
of whether additional cost risks are coming from, it's a wide range of 
ac
tivities. Most of these have been put in place either in Q4 last year or Q1, 
but it takes time for those actions to bear fruit, but they don't happen 
instantly. And it's improving and the cost of our logistics improving, getting 
better deals from suppliers
, design improvements, (indiscernible) are the 
ones that take the longest to come to fruition which is why we're only 
confident of the 25% gross margin number in sooner not sooner is because 
there are a number of prudence that have validated too 

 
that hav
e finished 
the designs that are validated and then put into production.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And I'll add to that manufacturing process improvements both in
-
house and 
at our suppliers, to take cost out.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, a number of our suppliers have really done so
me impressive work on 
cost reduction. And for some others that they just didn't believe that we do 
these numbers. So they didn't quite tool up for this level of production, 

3,000 over
 
the entire lifetime of the product. We did that last quarter, so 
they can't believe that those things 

 
that these projections are real and 
they actually tool up and are able to deliver significant cost savings for our 
product supply.
 
Dan Galves 
-
 
Deutsch
e Bank
 
Okay, got you. So just a follow
-
up, the suppliers are cooperating with you in 
terms of reduces. So I guess are you still experiencing a lot of premium 
freight from suppliers that weren't ready to produce this volume? Are they 
cooperating with you in
 
terms of the design improvements and kind of 
redesigning the component? And then my second question relates to cash 
flow. What's causing the decline from 65 million of OCF in Q1 to the 
guidance of neutral in Q2, and if you could remind us of your minimal 
cash 
level? Thanks.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
So to answer your first question, our S production rate is continuing to 
reduce every month that goes by, as both our suppliers have additional 
capacity to meet our needs and our production schedule is becoming much 
more st
able. So it's all trending in the right direction. And then to that same 
point of Elon where we ended with our freight cost at the end of Q1 was 
better than the average for the quarter, so it gives us comfort that or 
confidence that we continue to reduce o
ur cost. And then in terms of our 

lower deliveries in North America since we have quite a few cars on the 
board being shipped to Europe and that consumes some degree of working 
capi

significant number. So, when you combine the lower deliveries because 

board that has an impact.

Our next question comes from Aditya Satghare with Lazard Capital Markets. 
Your line is open.
 
Aditya Satghare 
-
 
Lazard Capital Markets
 
I have two, first is on the manufacturing process. You talked about the 
num
ber of manufacturing hours being reduced by 40%. Can you give us a 
sense of how much more room is there to go, and where does that stand in 
relation to your target? And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

here are a lot of activities in 
our manufacturing organization that are continuing in that direction. And 
then towards the, in half of the year as we start to increase our production 
rate slightly further than our present levels that will further add to th
e labor 
reduction on a per unit basis.
 
Aditya Satghare 
-
 
Lazard Capital Markets
 
Got it. Second question on demand; when you talk about the 15,000 units 
per year, does that include both sort of cash and lease demand, and could 
you also give us some more col
or on when we think about the 15,000 non
-
U.S. units what geographies do you expect that demand to come from and 
maybe a little bit more color on the buyer base, sort of who potentially could 
be buying these cars?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, we actually expect probably
 
most of our purchases long
-
term will be 

majority financed. And in fact in our case, it might end up being a super 
majority because, I think that the best way to appreciate the savings
 
you 

save $200 to $300 a month in gasoline relative to electricity cost if it's your 
daily driver. In Europe obviously that number can be double; it can be 
maybe $500 a month i


it will be a super majority financed in one form or another. And I believe that 
also opens up the potential, before going t
o the car to a much broader 
--
 
a 
much large number of people. And think if, like if our car was exclusively 
available for purchase and not via financing I think that maybe accessible to 
1% or roughly 1 million U.S. households. As a financed product with th
e 
right financing, sort of fully optimized financing product I think it's probably 
accessible to the top 10 million households. And then of course it depends 
on what percentage I have of those households will want to buy our car 

 
I do think that it's long
-
term it's primarily a 
financed product.
 
Aditya Satghare 
-
 
Lazard Capital Markets
 
And could you touch on sort of non
-
U.S. demand in terms of geographical 
mix and where that comes from?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, sure. Well, I think 

demand in Europe, and then at least 5000 in Asia, but I mean, that could be 
or so much bigger number and China is kind of the wildcard here. Its worth 
noting that all of the cars 

 
all the sales to
-
date 
including all the way 
through end of Q2 is 100% North American.
 
Aditya Satghare

Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
open.
 
Adam Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Elon, I know I h
ave asked you versions of those question before and you 
guys have done a phenomenal job building what appears to be a viable 
business and a thriving business although still early and at a risky part of the 
lifecycle of a company. So to kind of, when you lo
ok at where your share 

that are outside of you control to kind of make sure that all this great work 
your team has done doesn't go to waste potentially for those factors outside 
of
 
your control. Can you share your thoughts on potentially stocking in, 
carrying the balance sheet a bit more with a capital increase that could 
further improve your chances to keep investing in the business and focusing 
on the product and not the economic 
cycle?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. Well, we don't have any plans right now to raise funding. Potentially 
we expect to be 

 
we were positive cash flow in Q1 and we expect to be 
there relatively sort of neutral on cash flow in Q2. But if it was possible, we 
could be opt
imistic about raising a round, but we have spent no time on that 
at all. So if we were to do a round, it would be for the reasons that you 
mentioned which is to ensure that if there was some unexpected supply 
interruption, some sort of risk event, but shou
ld potentially protect against a 
portion of your event that there could be some merit to doing a round.
 
Adam Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay, that's very clear, Elon. Thank you. And just a follow
-
up to an earlier 
question about the geographic split. Don't know
 
if you can give any color of 
the 21,000 that you expect this year, how much and by order of magnitude 
could come from Europe and to confirm whether they'd be any Asian 
numbers in this year's figure? Thank you.
 
Elon Musk
 
Obviously given that the first half
 
year is entirely North America that also 
puts a flow of 10,000. If we stop shipping to North America on July 1st, then 
we would still have something like 10,000 North American cars. So we're not 
going to do that. But do not take these numbers as final in 
any way, but if 
I'm asked to sort of speculate, I think it's probably something 13,000 in 
North America and 5,000 in Europe and 1,000 in Asia. But this is 

 
don't 
hold me to these numbers. I don't want to put 

 
what I just (indiscernible) I 
want to brag to
 
it with the appropriate confidence. That's my best guess. 
Those numbers could be different.

Our next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. 
Your line is open.
 
Pa
trick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Yeah, great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a good quarter. 
Just on the sales number, I mean if you are selling, as you say, above the 
20,000 per year mark rate now, that kind of implies at least 55 a day while
 
we were still able to get kind of the sequenced reservation data in February, 
I believe that fell as low as the mid
-
30s. So, it's come up quite a bit which is 
obviously great. I was hoping you could put a little bit more color on that, 
how much of that is
 

 
how much of an impact have you seen since the 
introduction of a new financed product? I'm sure there's some seasonality 
that we need to think about and what's the contribution to some of the 
international sales in this acceleration? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Ou
r focus has been sort of more on just operating efficiently as a company 
and building cars that any (indiscernible) can just may improving the gross 
margin as well as ensuring we have really good service. We have a good, 
okay service. We're working hard on
 
making the service great. I think we 
haven't really tried to push volume super hard yet, because I think you need 
to make sure that staff is in order and the car is being made as efficiently as 
it can be made before you try to push volume. So that's why w
e haven't 
tried to do that. And I think there's a potential for next year, a fairly 
significant increase in volume as we really test the depth of the demand 
that's out there. I think it's probably quite a bit higher than what we had 
originally thought. But
 
like I said, we don't want to just ramp volume and if 
it's not, how it's taken care of gross margin or have that service and just 


most people are expecting us to 
do.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. And if I can just one quick follow
-
up on that, I mean, did you 

 
I know 

of the new financed produc
t?
 
Elon Musk
 



 
that had quite an effect on people. I 
mentioned sort of in a 

 
in some prior (indiscernible) unit, like at Silver City 
we saw just a
 
monster increase in demand when we went from selling 
people, sold the systems as purchase product versus the finance product, 
which really an order of magnitude difference in demand as a financed 

ything on that 

 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 


 
I know 

V credits for the fourth 


 
can you help us just bracket that possibility that 
there might be some, are you in talks with, I mean, clearly you have the 
volume to have further ZEV credit, so obviously are you in talks with other 
man
ufacturers for these kinds of credits? I mean is there any kind of feeling 
of probability that you can give us that would allow us to sort of handicap 
that?
 
Elon Musk
 


 
I would realistically handicap it at zero for the fourth 

 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay.
 
Elon Musk
 

anticipate saturating demand for ZEV credits, probably in the third quarter.

purposes of modeling our

Our next question comes from Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is 
open.
 
Brian Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
Few topics. Your customer segmentation, but before that just a more data 
point, so if you can provide them on the factory. Can you give us a sense of 
what the over time hours or 10th labor hours were save run rate exi
ting 
December versus one rate March? I noticed your inventory was flat even 

then how does that kind of lead to some of the gross margin improvement 

 
Elon Musk
 
Su
re. I mean, people who are working really at the sort of 78 hour week 

And we were also been able to release a lot of the temp labor that we had 
added to deal with our manufacturing
 
efficiencies and Deepak, do you want 
to add something on the inventory front?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah, just to clarify Brian, that our inventory was down by $30 million 
compared to end of the year, despite the fact that our production rate was 
significantly up 

inventory and our production processes.
 
Brian Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
And on the marketing side, do you have a sense you had your data round, 
what the other cars in your customers garage are or so
rt of what the other 

buying 
--
 

formal trading, which is what are the other cars that your sector customers 
typically own?
 
Elon Musk
 
Pretty wide range.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

some study or a narrow time period and it was very interesting to see there 
was victory across the entire gamut of price points and brand. So
 
we feel 
pretty good about that.
 
Brian Johnson

Barclays Capital
 
Okay, thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah it seems to be based on fundamental affordability rather than any 
particular prior car that they have.

Our next question comes from Elaine Kwei with 
Jefferies. Your line is open.
 
Elaine Kwei 
-
 
Jefferies
 
Hi, guys. Congratulations on the great progress there. I was actually 
wondering how development on the Model X is progressing at this point, if 
any of that 20 million CapEx is going to the X and if R&D 
is there as well, 
and just the launch for early 2014?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we certainly are making progress on the Model X. Our focus in the 
second quarter is to finalize the design, so it will be internal economics and 
the shape of the car. It isn't yet our to
p focus because our top focus is on 
improving the efficiency of Model S production and service. But it will 
become our top focus towards the end of this year. We are expecting to start 
production of Model X towards the end of the next year rather than the 
beginning, but I think we've already stated that a few times. So I don't think 

 
just for everyone let's just say that's not new news.
 
Elaine Kwei 
-
 
Jefferies
 
All right, that's great. And actually on the production efficiency with the raw 
material decline 
in the quarter, how much of that was volume versus better 
purchasing strategies or negotiating with suppliers or a benefit from low 
commodities and how much more benefit do you think they would be to gain 
there?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Well, I think the biggest chunk
 
was volume. Clearly, as our cost per unit 
goes down, the absolute amount of inventory we carry for the same number 
of cars is coming down. But I think it was primarily us managing our 
inventory better and that was contributing towards our working capital 
and 
improvement in our cash flows.

Okay, great. And just I have this last one real quick. What is the 

 
do you 
have a picture of what the 60 kilowatt hour mix looks like at this point and 
are most people taking the Supercharger opti
on on that? Thank you.
 
Elon Musk
 
We do think the mix 60 kilowatt hour is going to increase. We think more 
people will find 

 
I mean long term, I think it might be a majority of people 
who buy the 60 kilowatt hour version. But thus far it's been sort of mor
e like 
at the kind of 35% level on the 60 kilowatt hour car, but I think that's going 
to increase. I think roughly half of people are enabling Supercharger at the 
time of purchase, but I think that number is likely to 

 
I think that may 
increase in the fut
ure. You can enable the Supercharger at any time after 
buying the car for a slightly higher amount. So I think over time, most 60 
kilowatt hour cars will have the Supercharger enabled either by the initial 
buyer or a future buyer.

Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty & Company. 
Your line is open.
 
Andrea James

Dougherty & Company
 
Just to kind of follow
-
up a little bit, you sort of put aside the Model X, and 
the Gen3, you're focu
sing your resources on getting the Model S right and 
taking the cost out, and I guess what metrics do you look at internally where 
you can say, okay, this product's progress is satisfactory, let's start diverting 
more resources onto the next stage of Tesla
?
 
Elon Musk
 
We're already doing that. We're actually already diverting resources onto the 
next stage. So that will keep increasing through this quarter and next. And 
probably by sometime next quarter, middle or end of next quarter, our 
future products will
 
be our priority because we'll be oriented to be or at least 
we will have done the things we needed to do in order to achieve our gross 
margin numbers. Because of the time taken from when the parts are 
ordered to arriving, to be put in the car, car gets so
ld to a customer, we 
receive a check. It's kind of a couple of months in there. So even when 
we've made a cost improvement, it takes, call it, six to eight weeks for that 
cost improvement to actually show up in our financials. So even though we 
see that 

 
unless we really screwed the pooch, you'll see the 25% gross 
margin number in Q4. The actions necessary to take that actually have been 
completed in Q3, which means that we will in Q3 have turned to Model X and 
other things as our priority.

Dougherty & Company
 

confidence is coming from. And just like, on the lease accounting and on the 
financing program; can you give us a sense of maybe even update your 
GAAP guidance and w

financing program?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

see an increase in the take rate. Any thoughts?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, actually there seems to be
 
an out
-
financing program and financing in 

not us. I mean, I think the total number, state of the cars being financed is 
probably halfish of which half of those are through the T
esla financing 


 
I guess, the 
way to think about it. But I like to, I do think that the percentage of finance 
prices will increase both Tesla financed and third party finance.
 
Andrea James

Do
ugherty & Company
 
Okay, thank you. And then one more; does the word cancellation mean 

Are you still taking a down
-
payment and then locking them, and can you 
just talk a little bit 
about how that changed?
 
Elon Musk
 


see, if you put down $5000 of reservation without actually configuring 
the 
car or knowing how much it costs, and then a lot of people would kind of get 
shocked by; oh, if you had all options you want, its more specific than you 

now order the car with
 

weeks to change that configuration or cancel, and then after two weeks the 
deposit becomes non
-

sort of how things are working now.
 
Andrea James

Doughe
rty & Company
 

 
Elon Musk
 



 

somebody puts down 5K they 

 

rd processing fees 

reducing it from $5000 to some other number. We haven't made a final 
decision on that, but I think it probably makes sense just in terms of the 
cost reduction.

Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Merrill Lynch. Your line is 
open.
 
John Lovallo

Merrill Lynch
 
Hi, guys, thanks for taking the call. The first question would be, I guess on 
leas
e accounting. Can you help us understand the potential affect on 
margins? And then also I think you mentioned that there would be no cash 

this and can you just help me understand
 
that.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah, so the receivables would have increased because now this is a retail 
sale. We get the full cash for selling this car upfront. This is not a lease sale 

this
 


 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, (indiscernible) lease. Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

income statement is affected, because we have 
to amortize our revenue and 
be cost over a period of 36 months in this case to our retail value guarantee. 
So, the interesting thing is from a margin point of view as a percentage. 


upfront.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, it actually, I mean, our margin is slightly improved the financing 

generated by the T
esla finance partners.
 
John Lovallo

Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, great.
 
Elon Musk
 

was purchases.
 
John Lovallo

Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, and then in terms of the 25% gross margin target i
n the fourth 
quarter, now was this always kind of an exit rate to 25% or is this kind of a 
change in stats?
 
Elon Musk
 
No, no change really. I'd say we're 

 
we think we'll be at 25% on average 
for all of Q4. I'm fairly certain we'll be at 25% before the 
end of Q4 and I 
think it's likely that will be a 25% on average in Q4.

Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is

Hi. This is actually Amy Carroll for Ryan Brinkman. A good quarter. I just 
had a quick question regarding the traffic and storage. Just wondering what 
you guys are seeing and if you cou
ld kind of help us think about when these 
people come to the stores, what you're seeing in percentage of conversion 
rate? Also, I think in the first quarter you mentioned that some of the higher 
costs which related to things not going out perfectly through
 
the door, if 
you're still seeing that? I know you're servicing business is kind of still early, 
but what are you seeing in terms of usage and kind of just giving us a little 
bit more color on that, that'd be appreciated.
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay. I'm not sure I tot

 
Amy Carroll 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
The first question was just basically like when somebody comes to the door, 
how do your stores 

 
like what you're converting in terms of like actual 
sales?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we have a huge number of 
people come through our stores.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Initially an excess of 1 million people per quarter just for our new design 

 
Elon Musk
 
It's a low percentage conversion. I mean a lot of people in and 
educate them 
about Tesla and the brand. So that's our marketing strategy which is 
different from a typical car company. And so just a typical metric of 
conversion for traffic is not exactly applicable. I mean there's a lot of people 
that buy T
-
shirt. Our a
pparel sales are actually not bad. I think we could 
actually do a lot more on that front. We actually have millions of dollars in 
apparel sales, but we're not really trying hard. I think probably a better 
metric would be conversion after 

 
of a qualified l
ead after a test drive. And 
we're seeing something like 25% conversion after a test drive which is quite 
high.
 
Amy Carroll 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
That's helpful. Okay, and then just like on the service front if you're seeing 
like what percentage of people using it and
 
what are some of the more 
common issues on that?
 
Elon Musk
 
As I said, there'd be a service announcement. Our service has been okay but 
not great, but it's improving swiftly with these passing weeks. And we did 
have some issues there with 

 
we've got quite
 
a fancy door handle and 
occasionally the sensor would malfunction on the door handle. So you pull 
on the door handle and it wouldn't open. Obviously, it's quite taxing for a 
customer. But we've addressed that root cause and so essentially the door 
handle 
incidents have gone to virtually zero since we introduced the new 
version of the door handle and then we're retroactively addressing door 
handle issues or addressing for the fleet that's on the road, we're kind of 
fixing the door handles which in a lot of 
cases just can be done with a 
remote firmware update. I think the door handle has been a issue; we've 
actually ironically had an issue with the 12 volt lead
-
acid battery. There's a 
little 12 volt lead
-
acid auxiliary battery that we bought from quite a 
repu
table supplier, American company who then outsourced it to China, who 

battery, but by the time it have been outsourced to multiple levels, it turned 
out to be not so great.
 
And so w
e have to 

 
number of those batteries have had a much shorter life 

implemented a few months ago; much better screening of the battery packs 
and now have a substantially improved pack going
 
into cars.

7/25/19,Tesla,"Elon, the stock price and the results have been obviously performing very 
well lately. You've got some great investment opportunities and some 
growth opportunities ahead of you, not only in the auto business but also in 
the non
-
auto business and the 
battery business. So I'm just wondering, how 
are you thinking about being opportunistic and pulling in some fresh capital 
to help derisk the plan, plan for a force majeure, or to see some of these 
opportunities that you have.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, I think 
that's a good idea. I agree with that. I think that would be the 
smart move. We can talk more about that next week with

the Gigafactory plans. Unfortunately, I can't say anything [indiscernible] 
right now, except that I agree. I think y
our advice is good.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Okay. And I don't want to follow up [ph] or anything, but as a follow

up to 
that, I guess, is a

would a capital raising be a prerequisite to launch the 
Gigafactory? Or is that an underst
atement?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I think it's necessary to have it occur in 3 years. It's not necessary if we 
allow that time frame to expand.

First question would be, Deepak, just on kind of your outlook for free cash 
flow in 2014 and maybe in 2015, given the requisite investment that's going 
to go into the business. How are you guys kind of thinking about that?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes. Wel
l, I think in 2014, we certainly expect to generate significant cash 
flow from operations. And our CapEx then, which then feeds into free cash 
flow, will depend quite a bit on how we continue to expand and what 
opportunities we see globally throughout the 
rest of the year. So it's a bit 
early for me to call and give you clear guidance for certainly 2015 and 
potentially all of 2014, but we said we see this as really a great year for 
growth as we look forward.
 
John Lovallo

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Divis
ion
 
Okay. That's very helpful. If I could just follow up, Deepak, just kind of 
thinking maybe longer term, what do you think is an achievable kind of mid
-
term or long
-
term EBIT margin? I mean, taking gross margin aside, I mean, 
how are you thinking about j
ust kind of from an operating profit longer 
term?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think we have, in the past, even since the time of our IPO, indicated that 
our long
-
term target is to get to an operating margin which is in the teens, 
low
-
 
to mid
-
teens. And I think that is 
still what our long
-
term goal is, to get 
there as we continue to grow the business.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, but 
--
 
I mean, I should emphasize that we expect the reinvestment 
opportunities to be quite significant, I mean, for a long time. So our actual 
profitabil
ity will be quite a bit less than that. But if we would just sort of 
level out the business at any given point, I think something like a mid
-
teens 
type of number is very achievable.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Exactly. And that's how we've always communicated.
 
Elon R. Mu
sk
 
Right, right. I mean, the car business is truly staggeringly big. It's over $2 
trillion a year in new car sales. That's just new car sales, it's not even taking 
into account servicing and used car sales and just accessories and all the 
other things. So 
there's just a pretty big ramp ahead in terms of 
reinvestment.

Got it. That's helpful. Elon, I'm going to try to sneak one more in here. Jeff, 
I apologize. In terms of distribution licenses in China, I m
ean, from what we 
understand, they're pretty difficult to obtain, particularly without a local 
partner. How are you guys able to kind of deal with this issue?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Actually, sales and service is not a problem in China, it's more local 
manufacturing
, where there's an expectation that you partner with a local 
entity. And since we're really just at the early stages of 
--
 
very early stages 
of selling cars in China, and we're very far away from 
--
 
we're very far away 
by Tesla's time frame standards, away
 
from manufacturing in China, but we 
do expect to do that in the long term. At least for the short to medium term, 
there's not a need for a local partner.

Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson

Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Just want to look at the line of what you used to call reservations and now 
you call customer deposits. Went from 140 to 163, close 
--
 
last year, 138, 
and kind of have been churning in the 130s. Can we infer from that 
--
 
should 
we be inferring significantly [ph] a unit order uptake? Or is it more a mix of 
the reservations and the currencies and the products that people put down 
there to make orders, deposits, not reservations, for?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I think the biggest thing w
e can attribute that sort of growth to is that the 
Model X demand is very high. But there's a number 
--
 
obviously, we don't 
disclose it, but even though there's 0 marketing for the Model X 
--
 
essentially, it's like if you're going fishing, it's like the fi
sh are jumping in the 
boat. We're not actually trying to sell the Model X at all, but demand seems 
to be remarkably high. And we're seeing a steady accumulation of Model X 
deposits.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Which is on top of our ongoing Model S deposits coming [indis
cernible] that 
grows the overall pot.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes.

So if you look at your new guide for 35k units for 2014 and sort of the 
comment that a fair chunk of that will be in China and Europe, just w
here it 
is 
--
 
just directionally, where does the order book stand in these 
geographies? What's trending maybe better than you might have expected? 
And where do you still need some marketing or education work?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well, we 
--
 
I think there's probab
ly work to do in a number of locations in 
Europe, mostly because we still have to sort out a number of charging 
issues. Because the 
--
 
even though the EU is sort of 1 market economically. 
It's certainly not one market from an electricity standpoint. So we'
re sorting 
through a number of charging issues over there. And I think that's what's 
slowing down our [indiscernible] temporarily, but we feel confident about 
addressing those in the very near term and expect that the sales will do 
--
 
will pick up quite a 
bit over in Europe.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
At the same time, we see very good demand in China and a lot of the 
emerging right
-
hand drive markets.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, absolutely. Yes, I mean 
--
 
I think, based on current trends it seems 
unlikely that we'll be able to sa
tisfy demand in China this year. So there will 
be unmet

Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
I see that you're guiding
 
to a strong 28% gross margins by 4Q this year. 
Can you maybe talk about some of the drivers of that margin expansion? Is 
it more leverage of fixed COGS and higher revenue? Or is it still the case 
that you're realizing significant supplier purchase price r
eductions as your 
volume ramps?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, it's all of that. We are also continuing to make design improvements to 
the product, which is also helping us. And clearly, as we expand production, 
our suppliers see economies of scale and so do we. In add
ition, there's 
efficiency and 
--
 
as we continue to stabilize and mature our production 
processes. So all of that, we feel, is a contributor to getting to that gross 
margin improvement.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes. I mean, it's not a huge difference going from 25% to 
28%. And I think 
one can arguably achieve that just by scaling up. So, in fact, I mean, the 
28% number is assuming that the take rate of options decreases slightly. So 
we're not planning on lowering the price of the car. But as we reach the 
broader markets
, the option uptake, for example, people ordering, say, 
performance plus, we expect, will decrease, and there will be sort of more 
orders of the more affordable version of the car. So the 28% is assuming a 
lower average price because of a lower option take
.

Great. And just last question on China. There's been a lot of talk of 
government incentives there just for clean vehicle sales to try to improve the 
air quality. Have you been able to determine w
hether or not Tesla can be 
eligible for these types of subsidies? And then separate to that, I'm just 
curious, what kind of volume assumptions do you have in China baked into 
that 35,000 delivery number? And what do you think China could do for you 
over ti
me?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I don't think we want to break out the exact market percentages, and I think 
it's difficult for us to estimate them with precision, except that it appears 
that based on demand, since we announced pricing in China, that it seems 
unlikely that we'll be able to get everyone a car this year. And 
--
 
yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And in terms of the incentives, we are talking to the authorities, and we're 
working to see how the Model S can be included. Clearly, the initial round 
was 
--
 
sort of the
 
expectation was this only applies to local manufacturers, 
but that is something we're working to include Model S in that.

Regarding the Gigafactory, are you guys prepared to say you've secured a 
partner yet? And can you give us a sense of what you mean by, you said, 
""major reduction in pack cost?""
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well, we actually expect that there'd be more than 1 partner in 
the factory. I 
mean, obviously, Panasonic is currently our primary partner on cell 
production, and so the default assumption will be that Panasonic would 
continue to partner with us in the Gigafactory. But there are also likely to be 
other suppliers in the
 
factory that provide the pre
-
cost [ph] materials to the 
cell, so the anode and cathode materials, separator, electrolyte, that kind of 
thing. And so 
--
 
but I don't want to talk too much about Gigafactory because 
we're going to talk about that next week, a
nd there's a lot of stuff to talk 
about besides that in this earnings release. Yes, so I think we'll have to just 
punt that answer detail to next week.

Okay, fair enough. And then the next question.
 
Obviously, customer deposits 
are up 16%, so demand looks good. But I think it will be helpful if you could 
address the effect on demand that was caused by the vehicle fires last fall 
and the subsequent media firestorm regarding all that. And then is it 
me
asurable? What did you see?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes. So at first, we saw a significant drop in demand, and we were quite 
worried about it. And then as consumers came to understand that this was 
really kind of a media
-
driven thing and not a real danger with the ca
r, they 
-
-
 
our sales improved steadily since then and have continued to improve 
since that initial news. And, basically, consumers have come to understand 
that, actually, our car has a far lower propensity of fire than a gasoline car 
and by at least a half
 
order of magnitude. And so as consumers became 
aware of that, their fears subsided. But I think it's great that we live in an 
area where there's the Internet and social media, so that when something is 
--
 
when the fans are flamed literally by the media, t
here's at least a path for 
consumers to understand what is really going on. I think in the absence of 
social media, I'm not sure we would have been able to correct the 
misperception.

Do you need the
 
NHTSA report then to come out then? Or do you think it'll 
have no affect when it does? Or I'm assuming it will clear the car 
completely.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
We anticipate a positive result, and I think it will certainly help some number 
of people out there. And 
it's worth noting that 
--
 
I mean, the 
--
 
we've been 
cleared by regulatory agencies in every other country, so Germany, Britain, 
Japan, China, everyone else. So it's actually just the U.S. regulatory 
authority is kind of the lone holdout at this point. But 
we provided the 
NHTSA with all the information that they've requested, and we're awaiting a 
decision from them, which hopefully would come soon and, yes, probably 
helpful to some number of consumers out there.

First, on the production guidance for ending the year at 1,000 car a week 
rate, that sounds like it's 2 lines going full
-
time at roughly a 20,000 a year 
type of rate and a pretty good step
-
up from, I think, some of the previous 
guidance. Could you help shed some light on what's getting you there? And 
is that pretty much where you'd be maxing out?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
So we are constructing a new line in the factory. So it's a little 
--
 
before I 
answ
er, it's a little complex because there are many pieces that go into 
making a Model S. Some of which are production
-
constrained, and some of 
which are not. So to get to this sort of the hype, the sort of 1,000
-
plus 
production rate, we do need sort of a new
 
final assembly line, which we're in 
the process of constructing. And then we'll transition the final assembly to 
that, hopefully, around the end of the third quarter or thereabouts. Then 
there's sort of separately a body construction line, which is where 
you create 
the body in line and sort of the welded assembly, welded and bonded 
assembly. That's also taking place. That's not needed to achieve the 
production rate but will help with production efficiency, and will also be the

Sure, that's really helpful. And with that 1,000 a week with the new

the 
final assembly line, is that

with that, I assume that's not with that maxed 
out, and that's sort of using part of their capacity. And then there's

there 
would 
be additional capacity beyond that once the construction is completed. 
Would that be fair to assume?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes. It's fair to assume that we will be able to go to higher numbers if the 
demand is there to

Our next 
question comes from Ben Kallo with Robert Baird.

Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research

Just building on Elaine's question. You said if demand's there, can you just 
talk about the evolution, what you see in demand, if you
 
look back a year 
ago, and where you think it could be 2 years from now, 2016, just for the S? 
And then if you can loop that in with your production expansion and where 
that could get you with the 2 different factors that you mentioned to answer 
Elaine's q
uestion?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well, I mean, it's really difficult to predict where the demand clearly settles 
out for the S. But I can say, in relative terms, it appears that the X will see 
at least as much a demand as the S. And if I was to guess, and this is jus
t a 
guess, I think the X demand may exceed the S demand. I mean, this is very 
speculative, so don't hold me to it, but that's my best guess. I think X 
demand will exceed S demand. And as far as S demand, of course, I mean, 
there are a lot of factors here b
ecause it's not just for the S. But like let's 
say the world were to go into a recession in 2016, it's difficult to say what 
the S demand 
--
 
how would we be affected and that kind of thing, so 
--
 
because you start to encounter macro factors. But it seems l
ike 
--
 
it seems 
pretty likely that we could sustain demand of around 1,000 units a week. 
That's my best guess for the S.

Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research

Okay, great. And I'm going to ask on the Gigafactory, try my 
best here. You 
talked about partners, really, supply partners. Should we expect also, I 
guess, people that would use the cells, so customer offtakes or partners in 
that aspect of people that would use lithium
-
ion batteries in the 
announcement?
 
Elon R. 
Musk
 
It's tempting to sort of get into the Gigafactory stuff, but I think we could 
like have the whole call talking about that. And we're going to have more of 
sort of a dedicated call next week to talk about it. But, I mean, I think the 
Gigafactory would 
absorb all of the cells produced and that we probably 
need to bring in cells from other factories around the world.

Good. Fair enough. And then just housekeeping for Deepak. Q1, as w
e flex 
it, we're kind of right on the verge of profitability. How should we think 
about that as you guys go for Q1?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sorry, could you clarify that further?
 
Benjamin J. Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research 
Division
 
If I flex the 
numbers in Q1 and what you said, operating expenses and then 
your deliveries, I can kind of be on the verge of being profitable or not 
profitable. So how are you guys leaning in that aspect as we model Q1?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I see. Yes, we definitely should be p
rofitable on a non
-
GAAP basis, even in 
Q1.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I do want to emphasize something that 
--
 
it would be 
--
 
we could have tried 
to aim for a higher delivery number in Q1, if we were to kind of gain 
deliveries and not try to sort of be a bit of a contor
tionist in terms of vehicles 
in transit. But I made the decision that we shouldn't try to do that and we 
should just try to produce cars in the right way for the various markets. And 
so our actual revenue number for Q1 is going to be less than it would be 
if 
we did try to sort of play all sorts of games with delivery, delivery between 
domestic and international markets. So I think it's the right decision for the 
long term, but it means that our Q1 actual recognized revenue will be lower 
than it might otherw
ise be.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Just thinking about your comment on 1,000 per week Model Ss and kind of 
putting that together with your comment that Europe and As
ia could be 
about double the U.S. deliveries by Q4 this year. I guess if you think about 
12,000 units, like something approximately for Q4, 4, 4 and 4 between the 3 
markets, is that where you're seeing U.S. demand now? Is that where you 
think it'll settle 
out? Or is that basically trying to kind of balance getting 
vehicles to each region?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I sort of answered this question earlier, which is like it's very difficult to 
predict with precision the exact division of sales. Actually, the best fidelity
 
that we can forecast right now is really that we think non
-
North American 
sales will be about twice the size of American sales, roughly speaking. This is 
not to say it will be exactly twice the size, but it's roughly. And yes, yes. I 
mean, something we tr
y to do is to try to balance customer wait times 
because, for example, like last quarter, we actually did quite a few European 
deliveries because customers in Europe have been waiting for a really long 
time to receive their car. And so we just have to bala
nce that. We're slowing 
down U.S. deliveries and trying to make people as happy as possible, given 
the production constraints.

I imagine it's a difficult task. The second question is related to China 
chargin
g. What's your view on

I mean, in the U.S., most people are just 
charging at their home. Is that a viable option, based on kind of where the 
Chinese consumers are living? What is an option for a Chinese consumer 
that may live in an apartment building? A
nd how much work have you guys 
done on that?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
We're working pretty hard on that, and we believe we've got some good 
solutions. We're going to talk more about that in the coming months. Yes,

Our next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.

Just a couple from me, maybe starting with OpEx. Deepak, you said that 
OpEx is, I believe, up 15% Q1
 
and I think increasing thereafter, based on 
the investments. Can we put some parameters around that? Is there still 
--
 
as we think about operating profit, is there still some leverage, some ability 
to leverage OpEx? Or is investment cost next year really 
kind of offsetting 
this fixed cost component for now?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I mean, we're very mindful of OpEx. We continue with our culture of being 
frugal, but investing where it makes sense for the business. So I think it's a 
bit early or premature for me to giv
e you sort of longer
-
term guidance 
beyond Q1. But our approach really is to be focused in the most cost
-
efficient manner to achieve our growth and also trying to, over time, bring 
our percentage 
--
 
our OpEx percentage of revenue down and contribute to 
the 
bottom line. So I think that's the longer
-
term trend that you will 
continue to see.

Okay. Just, I guess, one quick housekeeping one from me. I don't know if I 
missed it, but did you give the
 
U.S./international split on the 6,829 fourth 
quarter and 22,000
-
and
-
change for the full year in terms of deliveries?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
No, we didn't provide that. We haven't done that in the past, and we have 
[indiscernible]. For Europe, more than [indiscernib
le]. I think 
--
 
I just 
wanted to say most of the growth that came in Q4 is from Europe, though 
U.S. and North America continued at the same pace as Q3. I think that's the 
more relevant information.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, [indiscernible]. Q3 to Q4, U.S. deliveri
es were very similar, but the 
increment went to Europe.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes.
 
Patrick Archambault

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. Can I squeeze one last one in? It sounds like your expectations for the 
X are perhaps higher than many of us h
ad thought. How can we 
--
 
from a 
profitability standpoint, how can we think about the accretion of that 
platform? It sounds like the volume is going to be pretty high. You're 
leveraging infrastructure, that's in already. Presumably, there's things 
you've l
earned in the manufacturing process for the S that you can still apply 
and that your suppliers have learned as well. So how should we think about 
that as kind of a tailwind or impact on the overall mix?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I'm not sure I totally understand the qu
estion, but 
--
 
yes.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
I can rephrase. It's just that you're launching a new vehicle, having 
garnered considerable efficiencies and learnings through the process of the 
S. And presumably also y
our suppliers have done as well. So is 
--
 
with the 
launch 
--
 
in addition to just the kind of leverage, is there kind of a margin 
tailwind that you can expect, just from launching the X and having applied 
all the stuff that you've kind of learned in the pro
cess of developing the S?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Okay. So basically, do we expect gross margins to be higher with the X? And 
maybe flowing back into the S as well?
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Yes. Yes, that would be it. And I'm 
not talking about just on the fixed cost. 
I'm talking more on the variable cost basis, actually.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Right. I think there could be, although, as I said, we do expect the option 
take rate to reduce. So that's why we're being 
--
 
we're saying sort of
 
28% 
gross margin. But if the option take rate doesn't reduce, obviously, it will be 
higher than that.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. And then what about like 
--
 
I know we're looking out to '15 for when 
the X is 
going to be in 
--
 
well, in launch mode and have some volume on it, 
but from 
--
 
is there some kind of mix tailwind to be garnered just from the 
launch of that product, just applying again all of the sort of efficiencies that 
you've learned and supplier rela
tionships and all those benefits that you've 
accrued through the launch process of the S?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I'm sure there will be efficiencies, yes. We don't want to predict something 
better than a 28% gross margin, but I think there probably will be 
efficienc
ies, seems likely.

Can you guys give us an update on the takt time that you're seeing right 
now? And the transition towa
rds running 2 full shifts, how do you see that 
playing out just in terms of hiring and how many people you're going to 
have to add to do that?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Colin, so just to clarify, I mean, I know we are running a 2
-
shift operation in 
a lot of our factori
es. And, again, the factories are very complex, as Elon 
said, and different shops run under different operating patterns. And there's 
no single takt time per se that we can share with you. And our focus is just 
to continue to improve efficiencies. And then
 
the significant ramp
-
up in the 
second half will come, as Elon indicated, with the move to the new final 
assembly line and the body construction line. So I think there are broader 
factors which help us get there. And tell me if I'm answering your question 
satisfactorily.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Are you thinking like we'll need to add a ton of people to achieve the 1,000 
car per week rate? Is that what you're asking?
 
Colin W. Rusch 
-
 
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division
 
No, more what I'm thinking about is the s
tandardization and the leverage 
that you guys are going to get off of the process improvement. It seems like 
you've done an awful lot of prep work in terms of setting a foundation for 
the process and then are making ongoing improvements to that, and then 
p
otentially locking in processes that then just basically speed up and you're 
getting more leverage out of that. That's what I'm trying to get after.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, I think we'll be able to ramp our production rate quite a bit with a fairly 
small increas
e in hiring. So, yes, I mean, our labor efficiency essentially is 
likely to improve a lot over the course of this year.
 
Colin W. Rusch

Both, if you don't mind.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes. I think Q4 to Q1, as we indicated in the shareholder letter, and as Elon 
mentioned, we are ramping up even further into Europe and China. And we 
could hav
e played games and tried to shift the mix and delivered more cars 
in the U.S. to hit a higher delivery number in Q1, but we decided to smooth 
in the flow of cars and our operational issues. And that's why you see the 
small reduction in Q1 deliveries and th
e mix shift a little bit more into Europe 
and Asia and from a production point of view.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, I wouldn't try to read too much into it, essentially.

My first question is on China. So your currency [ph] in China is pretty 
unique, first of its kind. Do you expect any kind of competitive response in 
the market? And maybe if you could 
elaborate on how that pricing is 
translating into demand for the vehicle.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well, I mean, hopefully, other manufacturers will adjust their pricing to not 
exploit Chinese consumers. I think that's the right thing for them to do and 
it's what they
've, I think, ought to have been doing from the beginning. I 
don't know if they will do that, but that's what they probably should do. And 
we are seeing really strong demand, which hopefully will continue, but it's 
been very strong since we announced prici
ng. And I think our bigger 
challenge will be trying to satisfy that demand.

we expect some of those improvements to be translated into the Model S

Elon R. Musk

I just wanted to get a sense for

or, really, a clarification first on the 
commentary you made with respect to the construction you're undertaking 
at the facility in California. Will any of that construction be leverageabl
e for 
the third
-
generation car? Or is this primarily dedicated to the X and S at this 
point?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
It's dedicated to the X and S. So the third
-
generation vehicle 
--
 
certainly, 
we'll learn from those lines, but third
-
generation vehicle will have a 
completely separate production process. It's geared to a higher volume, so 
yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And the Fremont factory is big enough to accommodate offline crew [ph].
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Absolutely. I should mention that we do anticipate being able to do the 
third
-
generation vehicle production in our Fremont facility. When it was 
owned by Toyota and General Motors, it was able to produce 0.5 million 
vehicles a year, and we feel like we can get there with our vehicles as well.
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & 
Company, Incorporated,

Understood. And then sort of a related question or a follow
-
up. Over the 
course of sort of the next 3 years, you've alluded to 
--
 
and I guess we'll hear 
next week more about the Gigafactory. Obviously, that overlaps
 
with what 
we understood as the expectation for the third
-
generation timeline. Is it fair 
to say there's been a shift or a reprioritization above and beyond sort of the 
third
-
generation car that's, again, more focused on the importance and 
relevance of the
 
Gigafactory and its contribution?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well, the Gigafactory is really there to support the volume of the third
-
generation car. And yes, that's really 
--
 
it's happening in parallel with 
development of the third
-
generation car. We want to have the 
vehicle 
engineering and tooling come to fruition at the same time as Gigafactory.

Craig E. Irwin

Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division
 
Most of 
the things that I wanted to ask have already been pretty thoroughly 
raked through. But maybe, Elon, if you can clarify for us what you said, I 
think, on the last call, where you discussed a preference for battery 
manufacturing technology with a significant
ly lower environmental footprint 
than what's conventionally used today. Are you possibly referring to maybe 
some of the solvent premanufacturing approaches? Or are you referring to 
some of the more advanced recovery systems? Maybe could you clarify for 
us 
a little bit sort of what you're referring to and what you prefer as far as 
technology?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Sure. Well, I mean, first of all, I don't think it's the case that current lithium
-
ion production is particularly bad, environmentally. But I think if you 
visit, 
say, the Panasonic cell factories in Japan, I mean, they are superclean, and, 
I mean, they don't have like terrible emissions or waste or anything like 
that. But I think we can also take it a step further with the Gigafactory and 
have a plant that i
s heavily powered by renewables, wind and solar, and that 
has built into it the recycling capability for old battery packs. So you can 
really look at the whole life cycle of a battery pack and just be in the best 
possible situation from an environmental st
andpoint. And I'd actually point 
out also though that lithium
-
ion battery packs are recycled today. There's a 
recycling facility in Vancouver and one in Belgium for U.S. and Europe, and 
they have quite a bit of value. So it's not as though they are sent to
 
a 
landfill, even as it is. But for Gigafactory, we'd like to sort of combine the 
whole thing, yes.
 
Craig E. Irwin

Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. And then one other clarification. So your ASPs have been trending 
positive the last couple
 
of quarters, but you seem to be conservative about 
the progression in 2014. Do you expect the sequential increases in the ASPs 
to continue for the next couple of quarters and then abate? Or when you 
look at your current order book, are you seeing a flatte
ning out of the curve 
already?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
It's definitely flattening out in terms of our purchase price. I mean, flattening 
out to, I'd say, maybe slightly reducing, but, I mean, it's within like 1% or 
2%. But we do 
--
 
I mean, I do think that there's 
--
 
it seems like the prudent 
thing is to assume that there's a reduction in the option take rate as we get 
to more of a mainstream market and a fewer people take the high
-
performance options on the car, which generate quite a bit of margin. So 
we're just tryi
ng to be conservative on this front. And maybe the average 
selling price doesn't decline, but we want to protect for a scenario where it 
does.

4/26/19,Tesla,"Hi. Thanks for joining us. So, I think we can proceed directly to questions 
and since there is no point in me reading something that you already have. 

 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. 
(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Adam 
Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Hi, thanks everybody, Elon, first question. The long
-
term supply contracts 
with Panasonic, you said it gives you increased v
isibility on variable costs for 
sales. But you also have increased confidence on the cost, i.e., based on 
what you seen so far, is it better than you thought. And the second part to 
that question is, if over time you have a competing supplier that offers a
 
lower cost solution, do you have any opt out from Panasonic, and if so, what 
are the sum of costs, what types of costs for that opt out? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure, we do have firm pricing from Panasonic. And so, we have very good 
predictability as to what wi

obligated to purchase 

 
all of those sales. So, it is profitable for us if 
Panasonic becomes uncompetitive to exit the bill with relatively small. There 
is some penalty that is quite small. Now that being
 
said, I feel pretty 
confident that Panasonic is going to be in the lead position from a sales 
base, actually I think for quite some time. And when we (inaudible) to what 

and so, I

 
Now, we do expect over that period (inaudible) for you to make a lot more 

of 80,000. So that basically huge room for a second 
source if that does 
make sense.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Thanks can I ask a question about leasing? Any progress on making or 
establishing any leasing partner as you get closer to the commercial launch 
of Model S?
 
Elon Musk
 

nversations but have just decided to de
-

leasing take place in probably the first, its only for the first six months, but I 

etter for us folks we 

achieve our volume targets in the six to 12 months. Yeah.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Galves with Deutsche Bank. 
Your line is open.
 
Da
n Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask 

launch of the model S.? How do you feel like your suppliers are performing? 
Is th
ere anything you are worried about in terms of suppliers on time or 
tooling getting to you guys on time?
 
Elon Musk
 
The basic tool rate is going very well. I mean, for us certainly is going very 
well, because we take that to a (inaudible) but they are all g
oing very well. 

of any one thing that I would call out as being strictly risky, but there is a lot 
of little things and that could potentially go away, but we are not trying to 
make 
sure is that we have the agility to respond to any one of those things. 

Manufacturing side that can go and tackle any specific problem once it arises 

 
if anything comes [ph].
 

right now. We do want to make sure this car is close to perfect as possible 
and we could shift cars sooner than July if we have lower standards in that 
regar
d but we want to really create a good impression with customers from 
the moment there is (inaudible) car, so...
 
Dan Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay.
 
Elon Musk
 

 
Dan Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Dan Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
That sounds good. And then, my next question is related to the mix of 
vehicles. When do you expect to kind of let the reservation holders to start 
specifying or specking the cars? And I guess more longer term; do you feel 
like you have the fl
exibility to kind of meet whatever mix of vehicles comes 
at you in terms of options, battery sizes and that type of thing?
 
Elon Musk
 

what is the best way to price this, we have go
t the various options and I 
suspect it strikes a good happy medium between customer value perception 
and consumer gross margin to Tesla. And I think we really, really to lifeboat 
[ph] into that, but in the remaining sort of deck, obviously we have to 
(inau
dible) if our assumptions are wrong and after we (inaudible). But we do 
expect to have that out before the end of this year, so give or take 
December at least.
 
Dan Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 

atever 
mix of vehicles people end up ordering?
 
Elon Musk
 

going to constrain that the option mix to a pretty high, you have to order 

ially. And we said this several 
months ago, for the first five months or so, we want to be offering the 160
-
mile range vehicle, it will just be the 300
-
mile and 230mile range. And there 
will be a couple other options that are kind of mandatory in the initi
al period. 
But that makes it easier for us to constrain the number of variables in the 

coming out of the factory. And I think that is sort of the best way to take it 
down of early de
mand. It is kind of like, when you order a new CPU or 
something like that, it would initially be expensive and then it could go down 

heavily optioned car initially and (inaudible
).
 
Dan Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. It makes sense. One more if I could? Based on the CapEx guidance, it 
looks like the CapEx is going up a little bit slightly next quarter, will that 
represent the peak of the CapEx spend for the next several quarters and 
any 
indication you can give us on kind of trajectory of why you are not really 
burning cash, because you are drawing the loan. But in terms of operating 
cash flow and CapEx, the trajectory of the negatives over the next several 
quarters, will it be moderat
ing?
 
Elon Musk
 
Deepak, would you like to take that?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sure Dan. On a full
-
year basis, as you can see, we have taken down the 
CapEx guidance slightly. Although, in the big scheme of things the timing 


for us to predict exactly what the quarterly CapEx is given some of the 
timing issues and how we pay suppliers. So, I think as we pull together our 
2012 guidance and share that with you during the Q4 earnings call. We can 
give you a better sense at that point of how CapEx will be fair through the 
year?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea James of Dougherty & 
Company. Your line is open.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company
 
So, in the quarter of order, is th
ere something about CapEx may come in at 
the low end of guidance and then you go onto say in spite of controlled 
expenditures on certain projects and you want to keep that confidential. And 
I guess any type of contacts will be helpful. What are you trying 
to convey 
by sharing this sort of mysterious detail and then, what are investors 
supposed to take away from it?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I guess, as I mentioned from the last earnings call, which I think it 
makes sense strategically to keep a few cards close to our
 
best and not 

there. Out I think those the things that we are doing, they are very 
important for long
-
term and when we do unveil them, I think people will, 
most people will agree t
hat there is tangible things to do, but we were not 
spending the kind of net that we were spending and not to make sure but 
when the planning is right what we can do quite to market with the key 
brands but I think you are expecting so to be so of truth. Bu
t previously we 
are keeping very work and extremely open about things and I just want to 
make the point that strategically will go forward with the few things that it 

 
Andrea James 

 
D
ougherty & Company
 
Okay and then one more and then I will hope back in the queue. Can you 
see this one for two program right winding down and not (inaudible) have 
something new in Mercedes related. How do we think about that the size 
relative to this one f
or two program?
 
Elon Musk
 


talk about it, but I need to be respectful of one of key our strategic pa
rtners.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company
 

 
Elon Musk
 

mutual consent of Daimler and us I mean, so when they are ready t
o talk 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question comes from Himanshu Patel of JPMorgan. Your 
line is open.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Hi, good afternoon guys. A couple of questions, Elon on the last call you had 
made a vague reference to some additional strategic opportunities. Was that 
the Daimler, LOI was that what you referenced to?
 
Elon Musk
 
No, I was pointing to something different.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. Number two.
 
Elon Musk
 
Can you just nothing...
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Could you guys talk a little bit to just Roadster volume, the quarterly savings 
really kind of picked up and it looks like you sold three times as many, I 
guess the growth rate is 45 units more than in Q2, which seemed like it wa
s 
three times the size, is that what you saw in Q1 to Q2? What kind of 
happened in the third quarter and is there any way for us to think about kind 
of the quarterly savings of Roadster volumes. And is there any seasonal 
trends here that we should be think
ing about either?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I mean of course, there is always some things to cover, limited 

(inaudible) convertibles footprint and (inaudible) little better and sooner 
than
 
(inaudible).
 

the biggest value of Roadster has to test those really kind of in advanced 
scout to help us understand how to make and vehicle how operates in most 
of the different c




atters in the long
-
term.
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. And then I guess if you guys could speak a little bit to the kind of pace 

300, 350 reservation for month here. Is that
-
 
i
s there something to the pace 
of that that we should be thinking about prospectively, does it ever become 
non
-
linear at one stage? I mean it sounds like, you are starting to be a lot 

v
iew on how we should think about that?
 
Elon Musk
 
The rate of Model S reservations does appear to be accelerating. And I 

advertise the Model S and we get a lot (inaudible) once we have 
on stores 
and our sales to integrate in North America really has shifted its focus at this 
point at least from the Roadster to a Model S.
 
But it is noteworthy that with advertising that you are seeing this quarter. I 

ze that this is just wearing out and our 
sales team but I think something that people were interested in buying the 
Model S should appreciate if that if the model S reservations continue to 
accelerate that it is very important for them to put down a deposi
ts soon or 
they will be getting a car in 2014.
 
I think sometimes people have got the impression that the Model S is kind of 
how other cars are where there is a ton of them on the lot and you can just 

 
are also down 
(inaudible).
 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. And then, I guess one last question. I think in the press release you 
guys make a reference to OpEx rising slightly as you kind of prep for the 

k a little bit about it the 
$74 million non
-
GAAP OpEx some of this quarter. How does that sort of 

that a linear short of mile drives or does it sort of have a big spike in Q1 or 
Q
2?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sure, before that let me just add reservations in Q3 for Model S were 1,150. 
So they were closer between 350 and 400 a month and as compared to a 
1,000 in Q2. So there is a very good increase in Q3 that we saw and then in 
terms of OpEx as y
ou know all of our manufacturing related expense in 
addition to R&D, is being booked as OpEx, until the in the launch mode for 
the Model S.
 
At that point, our manufacturing expenses would move out of R&D into cost 
of goods sold. As a result as we continue 

more the production workforce in the next few quarters and start training 
them and getting ready, clearly our manufacturing related expenses will 

 
At the s

expenses as some of the testing and supplier of ED&T work gets done. So 

mode of Model S and manufacturing expenses ar
e in cost of goods sold then 

 
Himanshu Patel 

 
JPMorgan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Carter Driscoll of 
Capstone Investments. Your line is open.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Thank you, good afternoon. First question if I may about may be you could 
add some additional color about the Model X, what you are hoping to unveil 
in December. Do you think you will be able to have an ultra
-
model produced 
by then? Co
uld you maybe comparing to contrast Model X with the Model S 
in little bit more detail. If I understand correctly you are going to be using 
the same power train and chassis and maybe just drill down a little bit 

 
compare why the Model S 
would be in one segment versus the Model X being targeted at another type 
of customer segment?
 
Elon Musk
 

but whereas the Model S, our goal is to address the 
premium sedan and to 
some degree premium SUV market, because the Model X will also try to 

market bridging to the many of that market.
 

 
X is to have more 
functionality than a mini
-



mini
-
van and t
hat they kind of hate it. But they need the functionality. I 
thought we want to give more than that functionality and I think somebody 
looks really cool.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 


to price segment. I imagine the mini
-
van segment is that more price 
sensitive than the premium sedan group?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, for SUV, I mean I know a lot of people who afford to pay a lot more for 
mini
-
van, because just nothing with the (i


-

(inaudible) and whatnot. But I mean in fact, I have (inaudible) like less 
premium sedan (inaudible) more I think going to look that way correct.
 
Carter Dr
iscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
And so criticism, thank you for that elaboration. Could you also maybe just 


in 

level of potential production defects and tightly control had initially, could 
you talk about in 2013 where you think the mix of options and range 

 
230 or the 300 where do you think that 
mix will be to get you to that 25% targeted gross margin line and what the 
variables might be that would increase it above or below?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I can do just my best guess is and I think most people are 
going to 
probably want the 230 mileage car. And I think a lot of people have been 
wanted the 300
-
plus mile car. Especially everything applied to the 310 to 
320 miles range. And there is some other advantages to that car and in that 

ing on much on the batteries lines. It does include 
things (inaudible) the long
-
distance intercity fast charging.
 
Okay, I think we will see probably (inaudible) 230 than next largest in the 

hat are 
pretty cool. I mean we are the biggest both openings of any car, I believe 
that any channel has to do anything. If I spend the Model X kind we get 
through having a convertible or about convertible. I think, people want to 
pick that option and the a
d suspension, which is able to (inaudible) the right 
height according to below the car and it will improve efficiency on the 
highway 300 down. You can raise both the car going through heavy flow. So 
I hope a lot of people get good option, because and a lot
 
of people really 
realize you can how cool option that is. So it kind of pays on how we can 
convert the value of having it. And then...
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 

will h
op back in queue is, could you give me a view of where the charging 
infrastructure is nationally, regionally and where you expect it to be over the 
next 12 to say 24 months, and where do you think that does support the 

hoping to achieve in 2013 and then 
obviously a lot of competitive vehicles that will also need that infrastructure?
 
Elon Musk
 

announcements about interested in charging, and interested in 
supe
rcharging if you will. So we develop what we call the Tesla 
supercharger, which is the 9 kilowatt charger. And I think we are hoping to 
have first one in 2012 and between Central Carolina and LA probably in 
January or February timeframe and when the (inaud
ible) schedule start. And 

the first one because I mean when you see what this looks like in a highway 

e and 


allow people to be able to charge 150 miles in 30 minutes and so that we 
think even cars (ina
udible) go back or come back and continue your journey. 
I am probably getting head myself on that.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 

developments that affect electric vehicles. Co
uld you talk about some of the 
noise that perhaps there might be a surcharge in terms of Congress worried 
about losing the gas tax as EVs perpetrate and how that impact sales?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

y EVs, it 


decade away from that. We always think the Roadsters is the vast majority 
of charging because 
at light from this garage, which I guess one would 
intuitively expect. So and great capacity of light, I mean huge enough 
capacity so that things to fit well with the existing infrastructure.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Appreciate it for taking 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Milunovich from Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
 
Steve Milunovich 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you very much. Could you 
comment a bit about how you take the 
customer feedback and any changes that you are looking to may close the 


thin
gs, do you have the ability or interest in taking that in and potentially 
making any changes for the production model?
 
Elon Musk
 
Oh, yeah certainly, we have said that there was really a data that actually if 
we were getting a test ride in, because there is
 
a thousand little details that 
we want to improve from the data and that like all the cars to be as close to 
perfect as possible. And certainly I think I mean a few things extremely 
comfortable I mean just everything is going to be as close to perfect as 

expectation appropriately. But I think almost all the concerns that a lot of 
the people expressed about the data are (inaudible) that we are (inaudible).
 
Steve Milunovich 

 
Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, and then as I recall last quarter, you had discussed a potentially a 
large contract that Tata was with Toyota and you suggested it could be an 
order of magnitude larger than what you have done before, would you like 
to provide a
n update on that thinking?
 
Elon Musk
 
We remain quite optimistic about the feature relationship with Toyota along 
with the key strategic partner. And things are going very well. And I always 
prefer to take my queue from a strategic partner before, told me t
hat 

 
Steve Milunovich 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, thank you. It was worth a shot. And then finally as you pointed out, 

ou will 

necessarily need to advertise then. But, when do you plan on advertising 
and when you do start to shift I would think it might be worth from branding 
standpoint beginning to get out
 
there in any case?
 
Elon Musk
 

be a few years before we do advertising. If our production limit is done then 
there is not much point in spending money in advertising and if we 
want to 



be any sooner than 20
15.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Aditya Oberoi with Goldman Sachs. 
Your line is open.
 
Aditya Oberoi 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Great, thanks a lot. Can you provide some color around cost you are 
incurring in Europe related to the (inaudible) ratio.
 
E
lon Musk
 
You mean with respect to the Top Gear, and finally crashing out?
 
Aditya Oberoi 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Yes.
 
Elon Musk
 

there and (inaudible) right or wrong essentially. Tesla was
 
really wrong by 
that show and it left a negative lasting impression in UK. And it took a week 
about just for Top Gear to strong it and so we got to change that data point 

want to s
ay anything that would negatively affect our legal case there. So, I 

 
Aditya Oberoi 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Or maybe I can ask you in other way that, you guys mentioned that you 
guys are incurring additional cost
s to correct consumer misperception. So, 
are these costs related to advertising or are they more of just legal costs?
 
Elon Musk
 

events, we have salespeople on salary and of course th
en there is a little bit 
of brand damage but I mean you can correct that (inaudible) damage at a 

 
Aditya Oberoi 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Got it. And can you talk a little bit about what are those 10% of things that 
are left at 
the Fremont facility as you guys mentioned that you are almost 
90% there?
 
Elon Musk
 

enclosures, which is sort of doors, bonnets and trunk. The assembly 
equivalent to that is arriv

example. And but I think we expect to have that in the next month or two. 
And the next big thing after that would be the stamping dyes for the body 
panels. And with those rates did it by a (inaudible) par
tner in that front and 
yeah, I mean, we should have all of the equipment in place by the end of 

with that invariable manufacturing lines and really, yeah.
 
Aditya Oberoi 

 
Goldman 
Sachs
 
Got it.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

suppliers and is being tested, including the body enclosures line and when 
the trials are completed and if they are fully acceptable to us, they had got 
shi
pped to us. So lot of progress happening at our suppliers at the same 
time.
 
Elon Musk
 

for those assemblies. They go for that Apex so if you all are debugging it 
Apex, so the Nm 162
5 they should address. So in principle, at least at the 
manufacturing module level that has been debarred. And then we have to 
just pre
-
mark is debugging the module to module interaction if you have 
customers from one hotline to the next. And so that shoul
d minimize overall 
manufacturing line risk.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And while we are doing this, we are continuing to do the data bills in our 
Fremont factory, so even though we may not have the full automation in 
some cases, our suppliers can provide us those parts 
based on the 

build
-
out and just refining and learning our own manufacturing processes 
and interacting with our suppliers as well.
 
Elon Musk
 

(inaudible) in the first stump a bunch of 
panels in Japan or Thailand wherever the case maybe, and then they send 
us those parts and the staffing guys.
 
Aditya Oberoi 

 
Goldman Sachs
 

signed with Panasonic, is it just for Model S or all the vehicles that will be on 
the Model S architecture?
 
Elon Musk
 
We try on [ph] using a common battery cell, so that would apply to all 
vehicles that use (inaudible) to more than just the Model S. (inaud
ible) all 
vehicles but to more than just the Model S.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Kallo of Robert W. Bair. And 
your line is open.
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
All right, thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on the retails 
strategy. Looks like you are going to end the year a couple with about 25 
stores I think is the number. Can you kind of talk about how reservations 
have changed for the mall as you have seen reservations actually come from 
the stores or from surrounding ar

also can you talk about what metrics each of those locations are going to be 
judge on as you go forward. Is there actual targets for reservations at each 
store?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. We see much store [ph] innovation co
ming from the stores, the 
peculiar [ph] ones that have higher traffic. And we are still at the early 
stages (inaudible) what should have built the other indications are very 
promising. But we are just seeing an incredible number of people come 
through our 
stores in the high traffic more [ph] and shopping (inaudible).
 
And I think that if I call now, they would come on to see (inaudible) in future 

vehicle. And so we think our store strat
egy and surely to be very powerful 
and fundamentally different and have been historically been in the order 

buying a car.
 
And we found that they sort of look at us like the rental apartm
ent, and we 


people, but product specialists, but we could start to sort of explain anything 
you want t
o know about the Model S or electric vehicles which I know. And I 

business in terms of closing, and an expected revenue source and...
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
And so along those lin

having Model S vehicles at each location, because I guess seeing is believing 
in some ways?
 
Elon Musk
 

beta there or not. 
For the next few months, we have a dichotomy which is, 
we need beta vehicles for testing and we need beta vehicles so that 
customers can see them. So, and we have to make a tough trade between 

ssue a few 

the first quarter.
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Okay. And then my last question is on the testing front, any update on 
where you are as far as safety testing goes?
 
Elo
n Musk
 
Yeah, the safety testing is looking really good, and at certain extremely high 
bar which is to be by five star pressured in every category. And from what 

every category
 

we have a fundamental advantage with the Model S, which is that that cars 


es us a much longer crumple zone 

 

you jump out of the capacitor window. You probably want to jump into an 
Olympic seismic pool than ted
dy pool. And having a long crumple zone it 
means that you can jump it as good, you can spread out the deceleration of 


 
fundamentally 

making necessary to standalone.

Thank you. Our next question is a follow
-
up from Andrea James of 
Dougherty & Company. Your line is open.

Hi, thanks Elon for allowing one more. I thought it was interesting, you saw 
in the U.K. that a TV show can affect the business in a negative, and also in 
a quantifiable way. I think so the logical follow up to me would be, did you 
see a quant
ifiable effect from the Model S event and subsequent positive 
media. And then accelerate, how does it track with what your expectations 
were after the event? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure, we just got a positive impact from the Model S better and it was 
roughly 3
,000 people can be visit our factory three months, many have 
come from countries all around the world. And although it was actually not 
media, it was really to let our customers know that their faith was not less 
priced, that was the most important thing.
 
So in order to come to the event, you have to be a modernization 
reservation holder. And yeah, so we wanted to show, we see what the car is, 

equipment is there. So when they
 
go home and I talked to their friends and 

they have seen the factory. And they are really the best people to sell a 
product in our existing customers. They are not only having inc
entives, they 

effective, I mean media was also very positive and helpful as well.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company
 
Could you see reservation increase or did you see some of the
 
$5000 
convert over to the authority?
 
Elon Musk
 
We did. So there is a 1,000 cars in the Signature Series and there is only a 
few hundred left actually. So next were not 700 and something at the 
Signature Series have been reserved. And in fact the only way 
to get a car 
next year is, if you buy one of the couple of hundred remaining Signature 
Series cars. So you have a number of people convert to that. Yeah, we just 
know it was note some of that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Rose of Ba

Ben Rose 

 
Battle Road Research
 

the use of materials in the Model S, are you thinking any differently about 
possibly using carbon fiber or oth
er advanced materials in the Model X and 
other forth coming vehicles?
 
Elon Musk
 


fallen banana leaf. 
So if somebody is looking for the model high ground, I 
think that we could find that are real high ground than fallen Banana Leaf as 

so there will be I think something that uniq
ue to the Model X certainly. We 
really want to drive innovation on the almost every funds with cars and but 
whatever we can think of that has the potential to amazing underline to our 
customers. We want to do that.
 
Ben Rose 

 
Battle Road Research
 
Okay and 
then just one final question with regard to your plans for future 
vehicles sort of broadly defined. Is it possible that you would look at some 
other kinds of road categories and maybe sort of non
-
traditional automotive 
categories where you could partly you
r electric expertise?
 
Elon Musk
 

best to drive our focus in the Model X and to Model X that it going to be a 
pretty great operating vehicle and because you also have that air suspension 
and that I (inaudible) an

and we think forward the best flow of assets of any car variant and so that 
should cover us grew around the operating point and long
-
term its possible 
we could go into a wide range of variance, but tha
t can shortly (inaudible).

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jesse Vigil [ph] of Jefferies. Your

Unidentified Analyst
 
Hi, this is Ellen Criddle [ph] for Jesse. Thanks for taking our question. Just a 
follow
-
up on 
(inaudible) earlier question, what exactly is less in terms of the 
Federal and State caution of thing and other requirements needed to get a 
new car on the road and to qualify for the different centers out there such as 
HOV lanes and have a couple Model Ss
 
already been sacrificed or will they 
be soon?
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually we (inaudible) sacrifice quite a few Model S is the constant thing 
and (inaudible) dozen and there is another dozen to come and as we do as 
much as we can with simulation corporate invited s
imulation the value of 



has
 
HOV [ph] preference pure electric such as California, growth drive in the 
carpool lane [ph] and without a problem that as you can right now with 
(inaudible)
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Great, and...
 
Elon Musk
 

es to deal with because 

 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Great. And now that we are talking about a car that could potentially be 
adopted in much great numbers, maybe perhaps more in EVs, are you 
engaging with any local utilit
ies or anything like that and discussions about 
potential customer issues with charging, whether it would be smart 

-
proofing [ph] question. 
So there is some in case of any potential issues of causing tr
ansformers or 
tripling (inaudible) mills?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, it was a 

 
so we have got a bad debt of experience with that with the 

you mentioned, but in terms of working on the bikes 
with charging and 


we 

 
where we did make the (inaudible) roads, so we made them at a small 
scale in order to a
void making in a meta large scale with the Model S and 
subsequent vehicles.
 

intelligence in the charge algorithms of the Model S even though serve them 
and the roads to. And yeah,
 
the vehicles are automatically back to input 
charging, they are current in voltage, there is a not a great problems with 

 
Elon Musk
 
Or maybe I can ask you we want to keep the

Thank you, good evening. A rea
l quick on the stores as you ramp up to a 
higher volume and get pass to your initial reservations. What are the plans 
for trade
-

 
Elon Musk
 
We definitely want to enable trade
-
ins and we are talking to a couple of 
lar

those (inaudible) for customers and so we will have that ability to deal with 
trade
-
ins to put the Model S, for the Roadster, we kind of sidestep that 

portant for the Roadster and for Model S it 
certainly is.
 
Elon Musk
 
All right, thanks everyone. And yes, we look forward to see you next 
quarter.

2/1/19,Tesla,"Thanks, Jeff. If you've been listening in on the calls on prior quarters, you've 
usually been pretty circumspect in our turn about the quarter results, but in 
this case I think that that just won't be accurate. This was the best quarter 
in Tesla's 
history. It was just phenomenal across the board and we saw a 
tremendous demand for Roadster, for Model S, well over 5,000 products, 
almost all of next year's production of Model S.
 
And we've also signed the $100 million deal with Toyota. We're actually in
 
discussions with them for a deal that is in order of 90 or larger than that. 
The retail strategy is going gangbusters, two new stores that have a new 
approach. The stores have had 200,000 visitors in its opening. Yes, it's been 
tremendous across the board
 
and with looks great momentum going into the 
third quarter.
 
So we're super
-
excited. We try to express as much as this as possible ahead 
of time, so to give people the maximum amount of time to ask questions. So 
with that, let's go to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Our first question is from Himanshu Patel of JPMorgan.
 
Himanshu Patel

JPMorgan
 
A couple of questions, I noticed the margins on the development services 
business side had gone down to 52%, and looks like that about may
be 20 
points or so below, where it was in the recent quarter. And then margins on 
the automotive revenue were actually a few points higher than where they 
were. Can you just give a little bit of color behind, how we should think 
about those two forecast go
ing forward?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
The margin on our development services contract will fluctuate from quarter
-
to
-
quarter, because there is difference in the revenue recognition, which is 
associated with the milestones that we deliver on that program versus the 
cos
t that we incur. This is very consistent with what we have been seeing in 
the last several quarters about our development services margin.
 
I think the automotive margin is a much better measure of our operational 
capabilities. As you correctly pointed out,
 
sequentially our automotive 
margin has improved from 20% in Q1 to 22%, as we have continued to 
improve the ASPs and the roadster and our ongoing cost reductions that 
we've achieved.
 
Elon Musk
 
And certainly, it bodes very well for Model S, a target of at l
east 25% 
margins in the Model S.
 
Himanshu Patel

JPMorgan
 
And then Elon, I guess a bigger question on Toyota. You alluded to some 
additional business beyond the $100 million contract with Toyota. I'm 
curious, do you have a view at this stage on how Toyota
 
is internally 
viewing, just the broader EV portfolio. Or do they have parallel development 
efforts internally with their own engineers right now for electric vehicles that 
are, I guess, in some way sort of competing with what you guys are doing? 
Do you se
nse that they're kind of gravitating more towards using someone 
like a Tesla more exclusively?
 
Elon Musk
 
It's difficult to answer the question with a high degree of accuracy. But 
certainly if one looks at the objective actions they've taken, the recent $10
0 
million deal and the fact that we're in discussions for deal that is in order of 
90 or higher than that, you cannot foretell exactly what will happen there. 
But certainly if I was to judge from tone and behavior, it's extremely 
positive.
 
So I would expec
t a company like Toyota, which is obviously gigantic, one of 
the large companies in the world, to have multiple irons in the fire. But I 
think it can also be said that there is no doubt that we are one of the 
significant irons in that fire.
 
Himanshu Patel

JPMorgan
 
And then lastly on the revenue guidance, you guys gave a mid
-
point of $185 
million, and it sort of implies about $78 million for the second half, which on 
a quarterly basis is about $40 million or so per quarter. That's a bit of a 
slowdown from 
the kind of I guess 50 and 60 rate you did in the first two 
quarters. So can you shed some color on what drives that sequential decline 
in revenue?
 
Elon Musk
 
We believe it being conservative.
 
Operator
 
You next question is from Andrea James of Dougherty & C
ompany.
 
Andrea James 
-
 
Dougherty & Company
 
Do you want to elaborate on that last question a little bit, it sounded like you 
did? Maybe not?
 
Elon Musk
 
I'd like to elaborate on it and think also that I shouldn't. Places we're in the 
are conservative, and I'm
 
optimistic that we will exceed them.
 
Andrea James

Dougherty & Company
 
I have three questions, first, regarding the retail store concept. Are you 
seeing a correlation between foot traffic and reservations, and I guess to the 
extent that you can 
measure it. How much of the acceleration in reservation 
has to do the store openings and how much of that has to do with the simple 
fact we're getting closer to 2012?
 
Elon Musk
 
It's pretty hard separate those two things. But I consider both having a 
signif
icant effect. And we are seeing proportionately higher reservations 
from the source with greater foot traffic. But I'd like to say it's difficult to 
separate those two things. I think we'll have a better sense for that in the 
coming months, but I can't say
 
we have an understanding of what (inaudible 
0.42) still going the right direction.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
What we have seen is a pretty interesting dynamic. We opened our Santana 
Row first and we saw increased foot traffic there. Obviously, we are better 
known in C
alifornia and that we could see that's coming through on higher 
reservations for the Model S and orders for the Roadster.
 
But what was interesting is that our Menlo Park store, which is not very far, 
also saw an uptick in sort of sales. So there's a pretty
 
dynamic effect. And in 
Denver, where we opened our second store, a lot of people really did know 
what Tesla is. And opening that store has created a huge sense of 
awareness. And initially we didn't see the momentum of reservations 
increasing, but lately i
n the last few weeks, we've certainly seen a significant 
increase in reservations momentum. So it's a combination of awareness.
 
Elon Musk
 
Deepak, actually made a good point there. If you look at our Roadster sales, 
we've got about most half of those Roadst
er sales occurring outside of the 
U.S. And U.S. sales I think were maybe 34%, but maybe 30% of California, 
something like that. But for the California Roadster sales, I think we maybe 
somewhere around 15% of the total sales in California.
 
But if you look a
t our Model S reservations, it's actually close to the 40% to 
45% of our Model S reservations on California, which means that there is a 
great deal of untapped demand for Model S, outside of California. But I think 
it's at least proportionate to our Roadst
er sales.
 
So we certainly are highly optimistic about Model S demand growth in the 
future. If you take it outside of the U.S., have the emphasized Model S, 
because the Model S will first be delivered in the U.S. And we want to focus 
on getting the Roadster
 
sales internationally. But it's not there, too big of a 
gap there in Roadster and Model S.
 
But as we turn up over to Model S internationally I really think we will see a 
very strong demands. Just touching a bit more on Roadster as well, because 
I think th
ere is some misinterpretation of situation with Roadster with some 
people thinking that we've sort of stopped production or something. The 
comment actually made a couple of months ago was that we'd soon have 
vote out of Roadsters, meaning there'll be no mo
re order slot left.
 
Our delivery takes place sometime after we do a sale, because we have a 
long waiting list. And so actually delivering, both in the U.S. until January 
and we sold out all custom orders for the Roadsters; a small number of spec 
car is ava
ilable, but otherwise we're sold out.
 
So they can't actually buy a custom
-
ordered Roadster in the U.S. anymore, 
and there are only a few spec models available (inaudible) quickly. Now we 
do have some entry result for Asia and Europe and will continue deliv
eries in 
Asia and Europe until we reach the third quarter of next year, because Model 
S will only start delivering Model S towards the end of next year. So that's 
why we're clarifying that.
 
Andrea James

Dougherty & Company
 
You shared a table in the share
holder newsletters, Model S development has 
I guess a timeline. There is a lot of information packed into this table. But I 
was wondering if you could kind of help me to understand, how we should 
look at it, what are you trying to convey with the informati
on? And just 
explain some concepts like, what is it mean that the beta process and the 
prototype/production phase in Q3, Q4 '11. Just kind of trying to understand, 
how we should look at the table?
 
Elon Musk
 
So essentially what we're seeing is that, we're d
one with the alpha phase of 
the vehicle in all respect. And we're now well into the beta phase. I should 
mention that we're planning on having a major customer event on at 
October 1 at our Freemont factory that will allow customers to testify beta 
vehicles
 
and also have a tour of our factory. We're sending out invitations 
pretty soon, but that's going to be a huge customer event and a few will 
have an opportunity to drive a car that is very, very close to our production 
lines, just 99% production design.
 
An
d so that will mark the first beta vehicle that can be driven. And our 
definition of beta is basically which is production designed, but there is still a 
series of small issues to be worked out. Some things you've mentioned like 
beta software or something 
like that.
 
And then our release candidate is something where we think the car is ready 
to go to customers, but we're just checking out the data, we're just 
validating that. That's our final production process. Also we're very confident 
about the progress t
o Model S, in terms of what the beta vehicle is going to 
be like. So we're very confident about the progress in the factory. And this is 
why we're going to have this open
-
house effectively on October 1 for all of 
our customers from all around the world, an
d it's going to be an awesome 
event. So maybe a lot to fun if anybody wants to come.
 
Andrea James

Dougherty & Company
 
Regarding the recently signed RAV4 contract, I guess what does Tesla need 
to do meet Toyota specifications, and should we model out some
 
investments there, and do you invest in permanent structures in the factory?
 
Elon Musk
 
What was the first part of your question again?
 
Andrea James 
-
 
Dougherty & Company
 
Regarding the RAV4 contract, what sort of investments do you need to make 
to meet the
ir specifications? I mean does it become a permanent part of the 
factory or what happens there?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
There is a lot of synergy in the solid frame that we will provide to Toyota and 
to Model S. So this is a great way for us to really make the most e
fficient 
use of our capital resources, by developing the common factory and common 
processes. Of course, there are a certain tools that we were a unique for the 
shape and the size of the battery pack, as an example, that we would have 
in the RAV4. But it's
 
not as if we are establishing a separate factory. It's 
going to be common processes overall.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, relatively small expenses that haven't already been recognized 
eventfully. And it also gives us a great transition for the Roadster 
production 
workforce to work on the RAV4 vehicles as an inter
-
measure before the full 
Model S production.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Actually just wanted to build on that las
t question. It does seem from the 
press release that the testing in the offer really kind of came fairly close to a 
lot of the simulation work you did based on the fact that you are on track for 
all your major time tables here. Can you maybe just dive in a
 
little and tell 
us where there are some areas that were different where you had to adopt a 
little bit some challenges that are still being ironed out in the beta phase? 
Just wanted to get a little bit more color on how that transition is going.
 
Elon Musk
 
In the other phase of any project, you discover quite a lot. That's why you 
have a lot of phase. It's nothing that's really hindered us from moving to the 
beta phase as planned. So there were a lot of problems and we solved a lot 
of problems. One of the to
ughest challenges is achieving a five
-
star crash 
rating across the board by 2012 standards.
 
Now, to be clear, there is no car currently in existence that has five star in 
every category by 2012 standards. These standards have risen quite a bit. 
But the bes
t, that's our target. And we got very close in the offer, and I 
think we're going to get there in either early beta phase or in interim by the 
sort of mid
-
to
-
late beta phase.
 
And the challenge there is you want a car that's extraordinarily safe, and our 
go
al is to make the safest car in the world, not to say it's electric car, safest 
car. And I think we'll get there. Then the challenge is to get there without 
adding a ton of weight. And the only way you can do that is by having a very 
sophisticated aluminum
 
body and chassis, which we've got, and using the 
most advanced techniques from the automotive business, also applying a 
few ideas from the rocket business. Demand is extremely important.
 
And I think we've really got something that's spectacular. We'll go 
into detail 
on that on October 1 when we have the customer events, actually planning 
on doing quite a detailed presentation on crash safety just to educate people 
exactly what goes into crash safety, how do you simulate it, how do you 
solve the problem, wh
at makes something good or bad.
 
I want to actually really have people come over to that, really understanding 
and knowing what makes a car safe rather than just sort of typical 
marketing nonsense.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
And I take it like the 
biggest piece there is the side impact requirement, 
right?
 
Elon Musk
 
There is multi
-
types of side impacts. There is multi
-
types of front impact. 
And then there is also rear impact and roof crush.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
And are those all new? I
 
thought there was the side impact that was new, 
but I might be simplifying things.
 
Elon Musk
 
In terms of what's new by 2012 standards? The roof crush requirement has 
increased dramatically and the side impact. So those are the two biggest 
changes.
 
Patrick
 
Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
On that note, one of the things that's very differentiated is your choice of an 
aluminum body. I see you had some discussion of the Schuler press that you 
guys have installed there. Clearly, I think you guys would be the only 
a
luminum
-
based body in the U.S., if I'm correct. How is that process going? 
What are some of the challenges with that?
 
Elon Musk
 
You're correct. We'd be the only aluminum car in the country, in the United 
States. Of course, there are many who have aluminum 
structures in the 
United States, (inaudible) rockets, if you're familiar with the rocket side of 
things.
 
We've really brought in expertise from all around the world on shaping 
aluminum. I think we're going to feel reasonably comfortable in saying that 
this
 
is going to be the most advanced body and chassis in the world and can 
stack up against anything. And it is more challenging to shape and bond 
aluminum than steel, but we've really gone through most of this issue in the 
alpha phase and then with the beta,
 
because we're getting through very 
tight tolerances. It's very important to roll the car to right the size 
measurements to have good gaps and tight door clearances (inaudible). 
We're building to very exacting standards. The challenge to have for the 
(inau
dible) uses car as a yardstick. And that's how it needs to be.
 
I don't see any issues in (inaudible).
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
And one last quick one, if I may, maybe more for Deepak. The increased 
CapEx guidance, is that more of a timing issue?
 
Is that pulling forward 
money you were expecting to spend anyways, or is that just an increase in 
the overall amount of investment required to execute?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
It's a mixture of several items. Timing is an aspect of it, but is also making 
some 
additional strategic investments on the Model S to improve cost and 
quality in some of our shops. It also includes some investment for Model X 
since we're beginning to kick that off, and some additional strategic work 
that we're doing.
 
Elon Musk
 
The plan i
s to have an unveiling of the Model X prototype by the end of this 
year or so, probably in the mid
-
December timeframe, so to get a real, good 
sense for that, and it's going to be a super
-
exciting vehicle.
 
I should mention that thus far, we've been very ope
n about the projects that 
we've been working on such as the Model S, Model X, Tesla, especially 
Roadster, and the top 10 deals. We're getting the transition to selling where 
not every project is talked about. So there are going to be some projects 
that for
 
proprietary reasons we want keep sound about. And so the timing is 
right to unveil them. There are a couple of those going on that I think are 
going to be very exciting when people learn about them, but we don't want 
to talk about it publicly.

Ou

I wanted to ask a little bit about the Model X. Thanks for the detail on start 
of production of that vehicle and volumes. In terms of the overall product 
development process fo
r that vehicle versus the Model S, considering that 
you're leveraging the Model S platform, is the product development process 
much quicker on the X than the S as been?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, definitely. It's much a lower CapEx and a much quicker process, 
because 
we're really keeping the fundamental timeframe and the chassis, 
the electronic components, touch screen, instrument panel. And these things 
are all common between the cars. It's kind of usually the upper body that 
changes. But I really want to leave a litt
le bit for the big unveil in December. 
So there are some pretty exciting things about the Model X that I think are 
going to be super
-
cool. But I don't want to say too much at this point.
 
Dan Galves

Deutsche Bank
 
Is that half the time to develop them for,
 
I don't know what you guys call it, 
maybe designed for Easter to start a production, or is it even faster than 
that?
 
Elon Musk
 
First approximation is probably about half, yes. It may be a third of the 
CapEx and half the time.
 
Dan Galves 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
An
d then talking about R&D and CapEx, just wondering if you expect to have 
a decline in R&D spending as you get up to the Model S launch, or will that 
stay relatively flat versus 2011 level considering that you seem to be in the 
midst of other development pr
ocesses as well. So the kind of a cadence of 
R&D and CapEx, should that decline in 2012 versus 2011?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
The bigger thing is by quarter as well. And I think certainly at this point, we 
have a fairly significant one
-
time expenses related to the Mod
el S as we're 
completing the engineering design and testing work with our suppliers and 
we're building the prototypes of the beta as we speak.
 
And in addition, we have almost 150 people in our manufacturing facility, 
which are continuing to show up in R&D 
expenses, and they will move up 
into cost of goods sold once we go into the production phase of Model S. So 
there will be some substantial reductions there on Model S related to R&D 
and our manufacturing facility.
 
The things that would come up as we go int
o 2012 is Model X and some of 
the other projects that we're working on. But overall, yes, there will be some 
reductions.
 
Dan Galves

Deutsche Bank
 
I wanted to ask about the cadence of Model S production a bit. I know 
you've announced that early production
 
will be kind about the highest
-
end 
stand models. Do you have any sense for how long that might last? It could 
definitely impact average transaction prices overtime, just of the 5,000 
vehicles you expect to produce in 2012, will those all be the highest
-
en
d 
models?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we plan to start with as we have announced the 300 mile range Model 
S, and there will the Signature series initially, which will be for the auction. 
So certainly they'll have higher ASPs, but I guess it has couple of different 
pie
ces in your questions. Perhaps you can ask Dan, what was your first part 
again, on that?
 
Dan Galves 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
I guess maybe how long you expect that to last. Just trying to get a sense of 
whether it will be the first couple of quarters of production 
that will be the 
300 mile vehicle or is that more or like you know the first 500 to a 1,000?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well we've indicated that before yearend we would have the 230 mile in 
2012.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, the Signature series, which is the first 1,000, will be 
the 300 mile range 
only, because it's kind of like the fully
-
loaded vehicle. And then thereafter, if 
you want the option of the 300 or the 230 mile, and at the very end of next 
year, sort of early December, it's when we'll be able to start making some of 
t
he 160 miles (technical difficulty).
 
It's difficult to predict advance how many are going to be 300 versus 230, 
but it could be half and half, could be 130, but it's difficult to predict. We 
don't have an indication of that yet, because we've not assessed 
that you'll 
pick one or the other.
 
Dan Galves

Deutsche Bank
 
Maybe just one more just looking at you're probably getting a pretty good 
sense of how your suppliers are performing, as the beta phase comes to a 
start. Are you having any issues with suppliers
? Are you more worried about 
your suppliers or your own capability in terms of making sure to be on time 
with the Model S?
 
Elon Musk
 
So far it looks like everything is on track, so we're not aware of any supplier 
or internal issue that would prevent delive
ries into the next year. And we've 
put so many thing on top that making sure that we have a strong supply 
growth engineering team that's up there that are applying the facts on the 
ground with suppliers that just sort of take in their work grid. And then w
e're 
making sure that internally our manufacturing ability is ready, before it 
needs to be ready. So far, it's looking good. I don't know of anything that's 
going to cause an issue.

Your next question is from Carter Driscoll of Capstone Investment

Carter Driscoll

Capstone Investment
 
My question really stands around, obviously the Model S. You've had good 
growth in the reservations, (inaudible) nicely. And obviously given your 
stated intentions for the second half production levels in 2012, you'r
e fully 
booked for that production level. Help me understand, what the limiting 
factors are? Let's say you had a continued ramp between now and your on
-
target production in the second half 2012. And let's say you reached, say 
15,000 reservations. Why would
n't you produce those 15,000 in the second 
half of the year? Maybe you could help me and discuss maybe some of those 
limiting factors, early production and trying to figure out (inaudible).
 
Elon Musk
 
You know the nature of our manufacturing line is it's li
ke spinning up a 
wheel. You can't just sort of go from nothing to 2,000 vehicles a month 
instantly, because we did that, there a lot of issues you encounter. You 
really have to kind of start the line with 10 vehicles a week and then go to 
20, and then 30, 
and 40 and eventually get up to the rate that where the 
production line can manufacture the vehicle with very high quality at the 
rate that you need it.
 
And if you just sort of went full blast, you wouldn't be able to keep the 
quality of where it is to be.
 
Now we have set things up such that and in this 
way, where a part of the increase CapEx come from such that we can do 
20,000 units on a single shift. And previously, we took 20,000 units on a 
double shift to allow for a better buddy to capture outside pot
ential, 
generally more money and we'll be able to do that in a single shift. So yes, I 
mean in sort of the 2013 timeframe it it's managed there, we can certainly 
do more than 20,000 vehicles. And we will work had to try that demand to 
the best possible lev
el.
 
Carter Driscoll

Capstone Investments
 
And my next question really is around, obviously some of the initiatives that 
you want to keep under reps for now. Obviously you have to have the 
secondary raise, and I would imagine most of that's for the Model X
 
there 
out for, and the Model S. Do you envision that you might need for some of 
these initiatives, additional capital or do you feel comfortable here on the 
bookings?
 
Elon Musk
 
At this point, we don't spend any need for secondary between now and 
Model S p
roduction. Let's see how things develop. I mean if we see a 
significant opportunity and things were the dilution to pursue that 
opportunity, then we'd go to market. But we don't currently see the needs to 
do that.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
That's too early to tell. Unt
il we fully evaluate the projects and looked at the 
full skill implementation and make sure these projects made financial sense. 
And we want obviously commit and go to that extent of raising external 
funding.

This is Eric Leeper in for Erik Olbeter today. My question is on SG&A. 
Obviously, good cost control over the last several quarters, but I wonder if 
you could tell us in on your expectation for that going forwa
rd and how it 
relates to opening new stores and bringing on new staff as you ramp up 
production here?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sure, yes, you are absolutely right, Eric. That as we do add more stores in 
significant numbers next year and then 2013, we will still see co
rresponding 
increase in SG&A. Well, it's good to see that despite adding two stores this 
quarter our SG&A was relatively flat. On the whole though, I am pretty sure, 
given our overall approach and not spending any money on advertising as 
an example, we wou
ld see that our SG&A as a percentage of revenue would 
be at industry or better than industry benchmark or at industry benchmarks.

And I was wondering if you could just talk about the competitive 
environment, 
specifically the Fisker been delivered very recently. I was 
wondering if you could talk about sort of how you view the market now that 
you have a luxury non
-
gasoline vehicle in the market?
 
Elon Musk
 
We've not seen any impact on our sales at all of Fisker. 
So frankly, I'm a 
little concerned about if something were to go wrong with Fisker, even on 
their demand or production side, that people would refer that there's some 
issue with Tesla. I just don't think that's a good correlation.

Our next questio
n is from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.
 
Ravi Shanker

Morgan Stanley
 
I am pretty interested in this customer event that you're having for the 
Model S on October 1st. I think this is the first time you've spoken of that. 
Can you give us some more detail 
here, are these customers going to be 
existing Roadster customers, anyone who's placed an order for the Model S. 
And they actually are going to get to drive the car?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, you have to place a reservation for the Model S. And one of the things 
that
 
we can do to reward customer loyalty, and have them feel really 
confident about the vehicle they put on deposit for. And what we believe 
that the best sales people for product or existing customers, and so we 
really want to have you come to this event.
 
We
 
won't have enough time for them to drive a car themselves, but we're 
going to drive them in the car on the test track for three months before 
(inaudible). So you get a real feeling for the acceleration and handling, the 
fit and finish. I think that people
 
are really going to be impressed by that 
and that's why we're doing it.
 
And as well as a detailed factory tour and to all the progress we've made 
towards production there. And of course, analysts are welcome to come at 
any point and see progress has been 
made. Analysts also love kind of this 
event.
 
Ravi Shanker 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Yes, I wouldn't mind scoring one of those. I don't drive myself. And related 
to that, when do you think the automotive media gets still right or driving 
the car then?
 
Elon Musk
 
We'l
l have some of the automotive media do that on October 1. It's not a full 
production. So we'll be only evaluating beta product as a beta product. But 
we expect to have some very significant automotive press activity at the 
event.
 
Ravi Shanker 
-
 
Morgan Stan
ley
 
And since you said (inaudible) do you mean that these prototypes will be 
much, much farther along than the current alphas and even the betas that 
we're seeing currently undergoing testing?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. But to just clarify, what we are testing right n
ow at the alpha is that 
were fully built, as we actually said, by Q2. And these will be the fourth of 
the beta builds. The alphas you're testing sort of fundamental functionality 
as opposed to tolerances of the interior leather and metal trim and that kind
 
of thing.
 
Ravi Shanker 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
And just a final point on this. It seems like there has been a step
-
up in the 
profile of Model S less lately, as seen on the front page of a couple of 
automotive websites and magazines, just the videos that you guys
 
have 
been putting out. Also, I believe a couple of people have cited Model S 
prototypes at some malls around the country and now you're having this 
event. It seems like a pretty significant step
-
up when you're probably nine 
months at least out from the la
unch of the vehicle. Is this planned all along, 
or is this potentially telegraphing that you have room to bring the launch 
schedule up a little bit?
 
Elon Musk
 
We're keeping our prediction of deliveries middle of next year. We're 
confident of being able to 
meet that goal. Specifically within the U.S., since 
we basically sold out of custom auto growth and only have a few in the 
showroom to sell, it makes sense for us to shift our focus domestically to the 
Model S. And that's what we've been doing, and that's 
going to increase with 
each passing month.
 
But this is for the U.S. Internationally, we'll start shifting that focus more in 
the middle of next year.

Blue Phoenix
 
This question i
s for Elon. Elon, thank you for being a visionary at this time in 
the nation's history. I think the country could certainly use more people like 
you, trying to challenge limits. So thanks for that.
 
A couple of quick questions. What do you think is one of 
the important 
lessons you took from selling the Roadster that makes you confident that 
you can actually meet or possibly exceed 20,000 sales for the S next year?
 
Elon Musk
 
The lessons from the Roadster are more in terms of understanding what it 
takes to pr
oduce a compelling electric car. The Roadster is a bit like the 
Apple II, and it makes a huge difference to lower the price. Basically, car 
sales increase exponentially as you lower the price. So having a vehicle that 
has a starting price half that of the 
Roadster is a huge increase in the 
(inaudible) feel like your sports bike car and then you consider the increased 
functionality of the vehicle being (inaudible) six or seven people, more 
(covered) based than any other Sudan and just a great right handling.
 
You 
might even think it's the safest car in the world.
 
These are all things that really amplify demand. So I think 20,000 units here 
is a very achievable number for the Model S.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
The Roadster has also enabled us to fine
-
tune our retail strateg
y, 
understand how we can sell electric cars. Also, it's not only 30 countries 
globally, small numbers overall, but sure it's really taught us how to sell cars 
globally, and it's set the stage for us to sell 20,000 Model Ss for our 
projection globally.

Blue Phoenix
 
I guess what we're seeing in the industry is there is still a huge need for 
education. It's great that the retail stores, hopefully that does help in that 
regard. And you're being I guess one of the frontrunners in implementing 
that 
sort of strategy, which is great. But still there is a lot of consumers that 
aren't willing to embrace this. There is still so much of a disconnect between 
the OEMs like yourself and the utility companies. I guess my question is how 
do we bridge that gap, 
how does education get down to the consumer level 
to have the confidence to completely forget about any sort of anxiety related 
to miles per charge?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think we're making good strides with the range concerned, Model S, having 
an option to have up 
to 300 miles range of vehicle, sort of roughly 40 to 45 
minutes charge time, from 10 to 9, getting charged, and then enabling the 
batteries worked out in every minute. That's not bad for going to essentially 
a second
-
generation of vehicle.
 
I've said for ma
ny years now that in order to make something, in order to 
achieve the mass markets, to have something compelling at the mass 
market level for product, you really need to optimize design and achieve 
economies of scale. And I think generally you need to do a
bout three 
significant iterations on a new technology at least. And that's why our 
strategy has been to start up with the Roadster at low volumes, roughly 
higher price, and go to Model S mid
-
volumes, mid
-
price. And our third
-
generation of vehicle would be 
high volumes at a low price.
 
John Licata

Blue Phoenix
 
You briefly touched on competition, and I think Fisker as well as probably 
anyone else that has problems in the industry, gives a growing industry a 
bad name. We don't have a national standard for cha
rging. And I was 
wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on what we need to see 
from the government to have a national standard put in place. So maybe 
that actually welcomes consumers not worrying about a new technology 
coming so quickly.
 
Elon Mu
sk
 
There is an SA charging standard, which is not bad. I mean they could do 
some refinement. And there are certain SA charging standards that are 
coming out. But I think it's actually going to be okay. I think what the issue 
is really going to be one of pr
oduction limitations rather than demand 
limitations. And I hope this is true, the tangibles will always be, at least for 
the next several years, production limited. Right now, if you put down a 
deposit for a Model S, you've got to wait 18 months. And yet, 
people are so 
putting down deposits, minimum $5,000.
 
At least from the Tesla standpoint, until we start seeing deposits, that wait 
time will go from 18 months to three months or six months, then really our 
focus needs to be on ramping up production as best
 
as possible.

Our next question is from (William Pack).
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
I think my question has been answered to the most part, Mr. Musk. I was 
curious about previous factory output for the NUMMI auto factory. I think 
that's 500,000 cars a ye
ar. Looking at 20,000 of Model X and up to 15,000 a 
year, I was just curious about any plans or vision for maxing out your 
capacity in the future maybe in conjunction with this recent contract as sort 
of set point for your automation?
 
Elon Musk
 
We certainl
y hope at some point in the future to use full capacity of the 
NUMMI factory at 0.5 million vehicles here. And we're going to work towards 
that as best as we reasonably can, but without getting too far ahead of 
ourselves. We really don't want to bite more 
than we can chew at any given 
point in time. And so we're trying to sort of make the sensible things. But we 
want to come out with a new product every year. And so there will be Model 
S mostly next year, Model X the year thereafter, another vehicle a year 
after 
that and another vehicle a year after that.
 
And we'll try to get to that full capacity as soon as we reasonably can, but 
making intelligent use of the capital we have on hand. So we'd like to be 
able to use the free cash flow from existing sales of M
odel S, Model X to sort 
of then go up to the next level without having to go through a significant 
dilutive amount. But that's our strategy and what I think makes sense for us 
to do. So we're going to try to execute.

10/26/18,Tesla,"Thank you. So 2017 was obviously a big year for Tesla. We launched the 
Model 3, which is our first mass
-
production vehicle, and it's a huge step 
change for Tesla. Lot of challenges, but I think we made tremendous 
progress on that front.
 
We also 
designed and installed and brought into operation the world's 
largest battery in Australia, that's largest battery by a significant margin, 
and that battery is exceeding its performance target significantly. We also 
unveiled the Tesla Semi, which is a supe
r heavy
-
duty truck, maximum load 
Semi truck, and the next
-
gen Roadster, which we believe will exceed 
gasoline sports cars on every dimension.
 
And we also achieved record production and deliveries of Model S and X. And 
overall, I think, while there were cha
llenges associated with Model 3 ramp, 
we were in a deeper level of health than we expected, so a few levels deeper 
than we'd like to be, but swiftly exiting, I think.
 
And so it was really, I think, on balance, a phenomenal year. And I'd like to 
thank every
one at Tesla, who should be very proud of the work they've 
done. This is incredibly difficult. And I'd like to thank everyone for their hard 
work and contribution to 2017 being, I think, a really great year for Tesla.
 
I also want to thank our suppliers, pa
rticularly those involved in the Model 3, 
as they've shared the very difficult struggle we've had in ramping up 
production. And they've really burned the midnight oil, spent weekends and 
taken a lot of risks and suffered alongside us in the challenges asso
ciated 
with the ramp. So I'd like to thank them for supporting us through this 
difficult time with Model 3. As well, our customers and Model 3 reservation 
holders, you're going to love your cars, and we're working to get them to 
you as quickly as we possib
ly can.
 
As for Model 3 production, we continue to make significant progress every 
day, and we're targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 vehicles by the 
end of March and 5,000 by the end of Q2. And as you've seen in the letter, 
the quarter
-
over
-
quarter
 
production of Model 3 is rising exponentially.
 
So I'm hopeful that people think that if we can send a Roadster to the 
asteroid belt, we could probably solve Model 3 production. It's just a matter 
of time, and really error bars on the timing are really qui
te small in the 
grand scheme of things.
 
So 2018 is likely to be a very big year for us. At some point in 2018, we 
expect to begin generating positive quarterly operating income on a 
sustained basis, operating 5,000 per week of Model 3 production, and I am 
cautiously optimistic that we will be GAAP profitable. It's not certain, but I'm 
cautiously optimistic that we will actually be GAAP profitable with no 
asterisk.
 
Martin Viecha

Tesla, Inc.
 
Thank you, Elon. Andrew, let's go to the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. I'm showing we have a question from the line of Rod Lache with 
Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulation
s on the 
launch yesterday. Wanted to just ask a couple of questions. One is just to 
get a little bit more color from you on Model 3, what the production run rate 
is at the moment. Maybe if you can just provide us a little more color on 
where the challenges
 
are at this point?
 
On the last call you talked about I think two of the four zones at Gigafactory 
that were still kind of an issue in manual operation. Have those been 
resolved? And once you get to 2,500, is the ramp to 5,000 

 
does that just 
merely invol
ve increasing line speeds?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. I'll try to give you as much color as possible. I am reminded of 

 
I 
think it may have been Churchill's line about sausage. If you like sausage 
and respect the law, you should watch neither bei
ng made, and to some 
degree that is true of our production ramp.
 
So, I wouldn't read too much into the day
-
to
-
day battles of this or that. But 
I'll give you the color, but don't read too much into it. Yes. There are four 
zones in module production. Module 
production is fundamentally the limiting 
factor on Model 3 output, which is ironic since battery modules really should 
be the thing we're best at.
 
And I think in part we were probably a little over
-
confident, a little 
complacent in thinking that this is so
mething we know and understand. And 
put a lot of attention on other things and just got too comfortable with our 
ability to do battery modules because we've been doing that since the start 
of the company.
 
And of the four zones, two of them, of which are su
bcontracted to 

 
the 
production systems are subcontracted to other companies, flat out didn't 
work, it turns out like, I mean, we promised they would work and it just 
didn't work. So, we had to do what would normally be maybe an 18
-
month 
development cycle 
for a production system of that scale and complexity, and 
try to do that in basically six months or maybe little, six to nine months.
 
And we've tackled that on multiple levels, so we have a design that is 
nearing completion for a new automated system for Z
one 1 and 2 that is 
being led by our Tesla Grohmann team. It's an excellent design. All the other 
work that they've done has performed to spec, and we expect a single Tesla 
Grohmann line to be equivalent to three, if not four, of the current lines that 
we 
have and be smaller, which is kind of amazing.
 
And then we have what we call a semi
-
automatic line, which is a series of 
small automated stations manned by people and they've actually been 
remarkably effective. It has to some degree renewed my faith in hum
anity 
that the rapid evolution of progress and the ability of people to adapt rapidly 
is quite remarkable.
 
Our semi
-
automatic 

 
our sort of semi
-
manual, semi
-
automatic line is 
exceeding all three of the automatic lines right now. So 

 
and that is 
something
 
that we're able to scale quite rapidly.
 
I mean, JB, is there additional color you'd like to 

 
on that?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. That's a great summary of it. I think much has been made about the 
manual production of modules, but it's really
 
not very accurate. These are 

 
these are, as Elon said, semi
-
auto lines where we have people that are 
moving materials, perhaps between the machines, that are actually 
performing the operations. But there is still a degree of automation doing 
the operatio
n.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's not artisanal.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly. This is what has been ramping quite effectively in the last 

 
in the 
first half 

 
first part of this year.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. 
Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, we're continuing to expand that, those semi
-
auto lines, and that is 
effectively bridging the gap as we re
-
design the full automation and bring 
that online.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, actually I think it's probably worth p
roviding some tours for investors 
that are interested, so you can actually see it first
-
hand. I think part of it is 
like, if you see it firsthand you'll understand exactly what's going on.
 
And so I think let's arrange for some tours for investors that are 
interested 
because I think you can really get a feel for what it is. Otherwise, it's just 
some words that are kind of hard to put 

 
hard to imagine.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I also just want to add. I think it's fair to say that this maybe degree 
of 
complacency that happened at the end of last year has been thoroughly 
replaced by an intense focus from a huge portion of the Tesla team and 
there are a lot of different initiatives and teams, whole teams, targeted at 
this area. So, as Elon opened with,
 
it's not a question of if we will get to the 
production rate, it's just a question of the matter of time.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Absolutely.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
If I could just clarify. What's the run rate now with semi
-
automation and 
when are you expecting the fully automated line to come on?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, it's probably a level of granularity that is not productive to dive into in 
terms of exactly what is coming from which operation. But we do e
xpect the 
new automated lines to be landing and starting up at the Gigafactory in just 
the next 

 
landing in sight within this quarter.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. We expect the new automated lines to
 
arrive next month in March, and 
then it's already 

 
it's been 

 
it's working in Germany. So, that's got to be 
disassembled, brought over to the Gigafactory, and re
-
assembled and then 
brought into operation at the Gigafactory. It's not a question of whethe
r it 
works or not. It's just a question of disassembly, transport, and reassembly.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, yes. So, we expect to alleviate that constraint. That 

 
with alleviating 
that constraint, that's
 
what gets us to the roughly 2,000 to 2,500 unit per 
week production rate. The next constraint would be material conveyance at 
our Fremont vehicle plant, so there's a very sophisticated automated parts 
conveyance system. We think it's probably the most sop
histicated in the 
world, or at least we're not aware of one that is more so, and the software 
for that is quite complex. So that would be the next constraint on production 
to get to 5,000 is the conveyance system in Fremont. So that also appears 
to be on t
rack. So, we feel like the error bars around the unit volume 
predictions are getting smaller with each passing week.

Deepak, a ques
tion for you. Given the negative trade cycle, your negative 
working cap, some of the modeling analysts are doing kind of simulating 
when you get to 2,500 or 5,000 or maybe somewhere in between that, that 
some of the arrangements you made with your supplier
s who have been 
very helpful, that you might temporarily run enough negative working cap to 
even have operating cash flow exceed CapEx. Is that something that's 
possible? Or, again, I know there's execution behind that clearly, but is that 
something out of
 
question, temporarily even?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We got to look at it from a full quarter perspective. The negative working 
cycle is amplified by the rate at which we ramp our production, given our 
present plans of getting to 5,000 by end of Q2. It'
s a fairly gradual 

 
it's 
exponential from where we started, but it's not going to create a situation 
where our cash flow from operations will exceed CapEx.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Thanks for confirming that. And just as a follo
w up, Elon, your kind of 
long
-
term compensation plan obviously got a lot of attention and raised 
some questions, however, long
-
term from now on succession. Just wanted 
to ask, do you see your successor as CEO of Tesla someone currently within 
the company r
ight now, or from outside the company, kind of how do you 
see that? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think that there's no active search going on. There's not even 

 
active or 
passive search going on for a new CEO of Tesla. I expect to remain CEO fo
r 
the foreseeable future.
 
But at some point if there's somebody really spectacular inside or outside 
the company who could take on that role and who would want to have that 
title and that role, and that would be fine with me, and I would focus on 
product d
evelopment, which is design and engineering, which is what I like 
doing best. So, there are no plans to make a change at this time.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

All 
right. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank with Baird. 
Your line is now open, sir.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I guess Elon, bigger picture in 
look
ing out a few years, you had mentioned a couple of quarters ago that 
the 1 million car target for 2020 was still there. And that you would need to 
introduce the Model Y by then. How do we connect from where we are today 
to getting to 1 million units a year
? And what should we look for this year in 
terms of ramping production or building a facility for the Model Y?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We are going to make some capital investments towards the end of this year 
related to Model Y. I don't want to 
jump the gun on those, but I think we've 
got a good plan. I'm pretty excited about how we're designing Model Y. It's 
really taking a lot of lessons learned from Model 3 and saying how do we 
design something to be easy to manufacture instead of how to manuf
acture 
or difficult, really.
 
So, I think it's going to be 

 
I really think it's going to be pretty great and 
pretty scalable for Model Y. But we are going to, as you suspect, need to 
make some capital investments in the second half of this year, really lat
e 
Q3, Q4 for Model Y. But I think we want to wait probably three to six months 
before announcing any definitive plans on production location and the details 
associated with that.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
And is that 1 million unit target still in play?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
Perfect. And then just one quick follow up. How should we think about the 
Tesla Semi and inve
stments needed there? And what do you guys think you 
can hit from an annual run rate in the next let's say two to four years?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, there's big difference between two and four years. Tesla 

 
and I've 
said, I think, even a few 
years ago, I think Tesla is going to grow at an 
average of roughly 30% a year, which is a crazy average growth rate for a 
company manufacturing a complex product at scale. So, two versus four is a 
huge difference.
 
But if you say 

 
and it's much easier to p
redict, especially these productions 
curves, they look like an S
-
curve, where you have an initial exponential, 
which if the exponential appears 

 
since people naturally tend to extrapolate 
on a straight
-
line basis, an exponential when it appears, the predi
ctions are 
conservative in the beginning. And then the exponential takes off and it 
becomes linear and then it becomes logarithmic.
 
So it's easier to predict 

 
far easier to predict the endpoint or the steady 
state of the S
-
curve than anywhere on that expo
nential or log curve. So if 
you take four years, I think, 100,000 units a year is a reasonable 
expectation. Maybe more, but that's the right 

 
roughly the right number, I 
think.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
For the Tesla Semi?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
Perfect.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. I think we might be able to exceed the specs that we unveiled last year 
too, wh
ich is pretty exciting. Another speculation that we might not meet 
them, but I think we're going to exceed them. And I made this comment 
before, (20:24) over these comments, but I really take these to heart.
 
The competitive strength of Tesla long
-
term is n
ot going to be the car; it's 
going to be the factory. We're going to productize the factory. And really, 
this is a lesson that is kind of obvious in history because the Model T wasn't 
the product, it was River Rouge. The Model T was a very simple car. 
Anyb
ody could have made that car, but not anyone could make River Rouge, 
and that's really what will ultimate 

 
what will be Tesla's long
-
term 
competitive advantage.
 
We'll have a great product. So a great design, great engineering the 
products itself in the ve
hicles and autonomy and all that sort of stuff. But the 
factory is going to be the product that has the long
-
term sustained 
competitive advantage, in my opinion.
 
Martin Viecha

Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay. Next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes 
from the line of David Tamberrino with 
Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thank you. Elon, on your autonomous vehicle strategy, why do you 
believe that your current hardware set of only camera plus radar
 
is going to 
be able to get you to fully
-
validated autonomous vehicle system? Most of 
your competitors noted that they need redundancy from lidar hardware to 
given the robustness of the 3D point cloud and the data that's generated. 
What are they missing in
 
their software stack and their algorithms that Tesla 
is able to obtain from just the camera and plus radar?
 
Further, what would be your response if the regulatory bodies required that 
level of redundancy is really needed from an incremental lidar 
hardware?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Well, first of all, I should say there's actually three sensor systems. 
There are cameras, (22:25) redundant forward cameras, there's the forward 
radar, and there are the ultrasonics for near field. So, the thir
d is also 

 
the 
third set is also important for near
-
field stuff, just as it is for human.
 
But I think it's pretty obvious that the road system is geared towards 
passive optical. We have to solve passive optical image recognition, 
extremely well in order t
o be able to drive in any given environment and the 
changing environment. We must solve passive optical image recognition. We 
must solve it extremely well.
 
At the point at which you have solved it extremely well, what is the point in 
having active optical,
 
meaning lidar, which does not 

 
which cannot read 
signs; it's just giving you 

 
in my view, it is a crutch that will drive 
companies to a local maximum that they will find very difficult to get out of.
 
If you take the hard path of a sophisticated neural n
et that's capable of 
advanced image recognition, then I think you achieve the goal maximum. 
And you combine that with increasingly sophisticated radar and if you're 
going to pick active proton generator, doing so in 400 nanometer to 700 
nanometer wavelengt
h is pretty silly, since you're getting that passively.
 
You would want to do active photon generation in the radar frequencies of 
approximately around 4 millimeters because that is occlusion penetrating. 
And you can essentially see through snow, rain, dust
, fog, anything. So, it's 
just I find it quite puzzling that companies would choose to do an active 
proton system in the wrong wavelength. They're going to have a whole 
bunch of expensive equipment, most of which makes the car expensive, ugly 
and unnecessa
ry. And I think they will find themselves at a competitive 
disadvantage.
 
Now perhaps I am wrong. In which case, I'll look like a fool. But I am quite 
certain that I am not.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Understood. And as a follow up, if I may
, can we talk about the trajectory for 
the Model S and X margins. 3Q 2017 I think the company was saying you 
were in the low 20% range. I think it took another step down per the report 
today. So I'm assuming it's probably at 20%. What's the path to recover
y 
from here and can you frame us through how you're going to get to that 
margin expansion?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We feel very good about the recovery of S and X gross margin in 2018 to a 
level which we have seen in the past, and it's a combination of 
a variety of 
things. It's increasing the mix of the larger batteries, the higher option 
content, and then also we have a very good and a robust manufacturing cost 
reduction road map. We will achieve a lot of manufacturing efficiencies, 
which continue to oc
cur on S and X. So, we feel really good about it.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, and we 

 
our internal plan, whether we meet this or not, I don't know, 
but I think we will 

 
our internal plan calls for somewhere around a 30% to 
32% cash gross margin on
 
S and X by the end of the year and probably 
25%, maybe 26% GAAP gross margin on S and X towards the end of this 
year, and then Model 3, maybe not by the end of this year, but not far 
behind it.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right. And this is, as Elon said, 
internal road map, an internal plan. Things 
sometimes get delayed, they don't work out exactly. But I think you get a 
sense that we feel really good about the improvement that's ahead.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Yes. We have a clear path to that goal.

Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Instinet
 
Yes. Thank you. It sounds like fr
om the letter that you could do more than 
100,000 S and X in 2018, but you're constrained by the 18650s. And I'm 
just curious what would it take to see the 2170 cells in these vehicles?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla,

Well, this is JB. It's something we've of course contemplated, but it's quite a 
large change to the architecture of the module and the battery pack overall. 
And while the 18650 supply is somewhat of a cap at about 100,000 units per 
year, even just a f
ew months ago we didn't feel that expanding and making 
some long
-
term bets on expanding that supply with Panasonic in Japan was 
really the right risk. It's something we could consider, but right now we're 
pretty happy with that balance and it matches our o
ther production 
capabilities and our other investments.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. It's also like for any given complex manufactured item, in order to go 
past the total capacity you really need to move the whole supply chain in 
cadence.
 
Jeffrey B. 
Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, you really have to then shift everything to say, okay, if you want to 
make 20% more S and X, everyone has to make 20% more.
 
There have to be investments in new lines or it's going to require
 
over time, 
which negatively affects gross margin. Kind of design the manufacturing 
machines are to create (28:43), and then you'd have to redesign the 
machine or go redline. And so I think we feel pretty good about the 100,000 
a year for S and X, and we w
ant to focus on just improving the efficiency of 
production and gross margin (29:04).

Thank you. Okay. Yes, it makes sense.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel

Tesla, Inc.
 
We are keeping the course on Model 3. I mean, that's really 
where the 
majority of the effort is.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, okay. Exactly.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Instinet
 
Okay. The other thing you guys mentioned was upcoming autonomous 
coast
-
to
-
coast drive, which we're really looking forward to. Could
 
you give a 
little bit more color on timeframe, when something like that would be 
available for customers?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, so we actually 

 
I've been meaning to address this because obviously I 
missed the mark on that front. Our focus is
 
very much on Model 3 
production, so everything else kind of took a second place to that. But we 
could have done the coast
-
to
-
coast drive, but it would have required too 
much specialized code to effectively game it or make it somewhat brittle and 
that it w
ould work for one particular route, but not the general solution. So I 
think we would be able to repeat it, but if it's just not any other route, which 
is not really a true solution.
 
I am pretty excited about how much progress we're making on the neural 
ne
t front. And it's a little 

 
it's also one of those things that's kind of 
exponential where the progress doesn't seem 

 
it doesn't seem like much 
progress, it doesn't seem like much progress, and suddenly wow. That's 
been my observation generally with AI s
tuff.
 
And you look at say something like what Google DeepMind did with AlphaGo. 
It went from not being able to beat even a pretty good Go player to 
something that could beat the European champion, then it could beat the 
world champion, then it could thrash
 
the world champion, then it could 
thrash everyone simultaneously. Then they made AlphaZero, which could 
thrash AlphaGo, and where it's just learning against itself, was better than 
all the world's human experts.
 
It's going to kind of be like that for self
-
driving. It will feel like well this is a 
lame driver, lame driver. Like okay, that's a pretty good driver. Like holy 
cow, this driver's good. It'll be like that. I mean, timing
-
wise, I think we 
could probably do a coast
-
to
-
coast drive in three months, si
x months at the 
outside.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Instinet
 
And then is it available for customers immediately? Or is there a lag?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, that would be something that's available for customers.

Your line is now open.

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As you put solutions in 
place one 
by one to unclog Model 3 production bottlenecks in Fremont or at 
the battery module line in Reno, are you finding that the ultimate solution is 
more or less expensive to implement than your original plans, which called 
for 25% gross margin on the vehicle? 
Do you feel any differently now about 
the cost to manufacture the Model 3 or its gross margin potential versus 
prior to the start of production last July?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think we feel good about that. I think like 

 
I think we probably are
, we're 
probably able to exceed that next year, probably. Like our understanding of 
manufacturing has improved dramatically. We can think of a huge number of 
ways to make it far better, far more efficient. I'm really excited about how 
much we're learning a
bout manufacturing. That's why I said I think long
-
term strength of Tesla will be the manufacturing plants, potentially 
productizing the Gigafactory, which is like the world's biggest product 
basically. Make it like 

 
make a nuclear Echo carrier (33:22) lo
ok pretty 
small by comparison.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, maybe just to add to that. I mean, the products' bill of materials cost 
and the embedded labor cost is, I think that's where there's opportunities. 
And we are simplifying and we're findi
ng ways to improve the design 
incrementally as we go through the ramp. If there's some small increases in 
CapEx that doesn't directly 

 
it will be overwhelmed by the improvements 
and simplicity and some cost savings in the product itself.
 
Ryan 
Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. I think the bottom line is we feel really optimistic about the long
-
term 
potential for gross margin on Model 3 and especially Model Y.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We haven't seen a
nything that currently changes our view.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just 

 
yes. And then for my follow up, 
I see the guidance in the letter about the quarterly operating income turning 
positive at some poi
nt in 2018. That's great. I'm just curious what your 
thoughts are with regard to when you also might generate free cash flow. Is 
that less of a medium
-
term focus as you prefer to invest operating cash 
flows from the Model 3 into the Semi truck, the Roadste
r, and Model Y?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. We could be positive cash flow, like I think pretty significant positive 
cash flow probably in like third quarter, which is like maybe four, five 
months from now. But we think it makes sense to invest in M
odel Y and 

 
yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Future growth of our energy products, Model 3, future growth of that, so.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Our energy products, yeah. The opportunities we see are 

 
we see really 
good opportunities there.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Makes good business case, good business sense to invest.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Super bullish (35:08). What I find sort of interesting is that our 
competitors 

 
the car industry thinks they're really good at manufactu
ring. 
And actually they are quite good at manufacturing, but they just don't 
realize just how much potential there is for improvement. It's way more than 
they think.
 
I went through this math I think on a prior earnings call, but like it sounds 
like some of
 
the fastest car factories produce a car maybe every 25 seconds. 
That sounds fast. But if you think of a 5
-
meter long car, including gap, and a 
4.5 meter car with a half meter gap or something, that's only 0.2 meters per 
second. Like grandma with a walker 
can exceed the speed of the fastest 
production line we're in, so really no that fast. Walking speed is one meter 
per second, so five times faster than the fastest production line on earth.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
That's interesting comment.
 
Elon Reeve M
usk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Why shouldn't it at least be jogging speed? I mean in the limit, companies 
should start caring about the aero drag in the factory, which that's maybe 
around 20 miles or 30 miles an hour, or call it 30 kilometers an hour, 40 
kilometers an 
hour. It's like, stuff should be moving at that speed.

Operator
 
All right. And our next que
stion comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with 
Bernstein. Your line is now open.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. You commented in the shareholder letter that capital 
expenditures for 2018 were expected to be a bit 
higher than 2017. I'm 
wondering if you could tell us what exactly is in that, call it roughly, $3.5 
billion. Are you going to get to full like 10,000 car per week capacity? Is that 
in the $3.5 billion? What will Gigafactory production be? And in the slight
ly 
more than $3.4 billion, is that also including the investments, Elon, that you 
mentioned on Model Y? So where exactly is this level of capital spending 
going to take us in 2018? And I have a follow
-
up, please.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. I mean, ou
r biggest 

 
our very high level, sort of breakdown, our 
biggest investment is obviously in the Model 3. And that includes completion 
of the payments that we still have to make on the capacity we are putting in 
place now as well as significant investment in
 
our required up front for the 
next phase of Model 3 production to 10,000 plus per week. So that's, I 
would say, overall more than 50%. Way more than 50% is Model 3, and the 
rest is all the many other things we talked about, whether it's energy 
storage, wh
ether it's 
-
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Primarily Y and energy storage.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And then our infrastructure spend, superchargers, stores, service centers, 
we want to significantly increase the service capacity, we want to 
significantly increase our supercharging capacity.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So all of those pieces then add up to the total spend.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Just to give some sort of flavor for optimism on Mo
del Y for a minute. 
I think 

 
Model Y, I think, we might aim for something like maybe capacity 
of 1 million units a year, something like that, just for Model Y alone. And I 
think we'll be able to do that for CapEx that is less than the Model 3 CapEx 
at the
 
$0.5 million. So probably 

 
I think we can probably improve CapEx by 
a factor of 2. Not a promise, but that's my gut feel on Model Y CapEx, just to 
give you a flavor for my level of optimism on improvements on the 
manufacturing front.
 
Antonio M. Sacconagh
i 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. That's helpful. So is the 

 
$3.5 billion and the greater than 50% 
to Model 3, is that going to complete all the required equipment to get us to 
10,000 a week at the end of the year or are we still going to have
 
incremental capital expenditures? And then, separately on my second 
question, around Model 3 gross margins, I think you had said that you 
expected them to be breakeven this quarter. Obviously, volume was lower 
and so you didn't get there. But for next qua
rter you're suggesting that 
they're going to be negative, again, despite the fact that I think Q1 volumes 
are much higher than what you would have anticipated originally for Q4 
when you thought that margins would be breakeven. So can you help 
reconcile the
 
apparent enthusiasm you have about the gross margin 
trajectory with the fact that your guidance around gross margins in the 
near
-
term actually appears more cautious than it was early this year 
(40:38).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Did we just lose the li
ne?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Can you hear us?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Hello?
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes. I can hear you. Thank you.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Always. Yes. To sort of finish off your first though
t or question, no, we 
will still have further investments in 10,000 per week capacity of Model 3 
happening next year, as a lot of that will be concluded next year. There's 
always a lag in our cash outflow, and while we continue to test the 
equipment and ve
rify it. So that'll continue in 2019.
 
And then, in terms of the Model 3 gross margin, our expectations earlier 
were off a much steeper ramp than what we are projecting here. We were 
targeting, as you well know, at one point hitting 5,000 by the end of 2017
, 
and now that's six months later. So at that slower ramp, we just know we'll 
have inefficiencies. We have the full capacity, sort of depreciation of all that 
equipment, and the operating costs are hitting, while we're not producing as 
many cars. It's actu
ally pretty simple, and it's only temporary.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It doesn't imply anything fundamental.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Exactly. So the problem is like when you've got a machine, where 
mo
st of that machine 

 
I mean that overall production and supply chain 
machine is at a 5,000 unit capacity, but then 10% or 15% of it isn't, then 
you've got this massive load on a small 

 
on a way smaller production 
volume. And as that production volume 

 
as
 
you fix the remaining 10% or 
15% of the production machine, you're able to get to that target production 
and then things improve dramatically.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's sort of like having a car that's 
operating at a fraction of its 

 
let's use a 
gasoline analogy. You got a four
-
cylinder car operating on one cylinder, it's 
like, okay, (43:01) it's just like a big machine actually. Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. 
Your line is now open.
 
Philippe Jean Houchois 
-
 
Jefferies International Ltd.
 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have a 

 
slightly non
-
related to earnings, about the electric truck, the Semi. In the past, Mr. 
Musk, you have spoken about a supercapacitor as a way of generating 
energy or storing energy. Particularly in the application of heavy trucks, I 
would expect that the surge of energy
 
in slowing down or braking in the 
truck would be too much for battery to absorb. Are you considering 
supercapacitor as an application for the Semi or what is your kind of general 
thought on that technology and the implications to make that industrially 
vi
able?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. I mean ages ago, I was going to do basically an applied physical 
control science degree 

 
a Ph.D in capacitors, so I'm a big fan of capacitors. 
I just don't think 

 
I think the lithium
-
ion chemistry is so good at t
his point 
that capacitors will not be needed. There's a certain power to energy ratio, 
and once you have a huge amount of energy, which is needed for range, 
then you automatically have the power you need for absorbing 

 
being able 
to do rapid acceleration 
and braking.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. It's maybe not intuitive 

 
this is JB 

 
but the power to energy demand 
on the battery in the heavy truck is actually generally less than in our 
performance vehicles. It's definitely less also in most cas
es than even the 
high rate of discharge energy products. As Elon said, you have you a lot of 
energy, so you end up with a lot of power, actually more than you need.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. And the way the chemistry works is that you're able 
to actually extract 

 
for short periods of time 

 
extract very high power from lithium
-
ion cells, 
as you sort of have ion migration right on surface. And then the sustained 
power for lithium
-
ion is certainly less than the power over, say, the course of 
sev
eral seconds, or a minute. But the several seconds power for lithium
-
ion 
is remarkably good because you're essentially using ion migration from the 
outer surface. It's like if you have a parking lot, all the cars in the front of 
the parking lot can just ex
it, but once you start getting cars from deep in the 
parking lot, it takes a while for them to wind their way out.

Brian A. Johnson

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes. I'd like to talk, follow up a little bit on the first question around some of 
the manufacturing roadblo
cks as well as the comment about building a 
machine to build the machine, which I believe was the title of a 1990 MIT 
book about Toyota. Could you maybe give us some more discussion really 
on the managerial culture, the process level? How you would benchma
rk 
yourself for example against a Toyota factory, which seems to be able to 
launch a new product in about three or four months to ramp up? Or at the 
other extreme, because I know Mr. Field came from there, kind of what 
Foxconn does in its goal to replace h
umans? But in particular, you talk about 
the managerial processes, not so much the robots you're putting into place.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, I'm pretty sure Toyota cannot ramp up a new product in three months. 
In fact, I'm 100% certain about th
at. Deepak spent many years at Ford 
before joining Tesla.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Generally, companies including Toyota take anywhere from six months 
to a year when they come up with an all new product.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-

And old news li
ke that's 

 
they are still, it's not really 

 
the amount of 
technology that changes is not that much.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's a major platform, so it's not all new as a Model S or an X that we've 
done. So it is longer.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right. They're not fundamentally new technologies.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Brian A. Johnson

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. But within that then what are the differences though in the way you're 
going to be managing the factory?
 
Elon Ree
ve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The most fundamental difference is thinking about the factory really as a 
product, as a quite vertically integrated product.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's treating it as more of an engineering and a technical problem as well.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Instead of...
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Right, which is the Toyota Production System.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. We don't think so.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, 
Inc.
 
I think that generally it's more of an optimized operational problem, being 
extremely lean and really managing the flows of materials and the supply 
chain. They're great at it, but this is I think a different approach, looking at 
it really from a deep
 
technical lens in terms of automation, robotics, process.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Imagine like if the Model S was a 

 
the way you design a Model S, 
design in factory like it's a car. You still have a lot of workers, you still have 
a lot of peo
ple, and it's just like with the Model S, say, we have a large 
service organization that has scheduled maintenance, that has things that 
break, there are crashes that need to be repaired, there's technology 
upgrades. But you don't actually ship people with
 
the Model S. That would 
be weird. It's not like tiny people in the car. So you have 

 
we expect that 
the Tesla factory has a lot of people around the factory, but very few people 
in it.
 
Doug Field 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I also think that the degree with which we h
ave 

 
this is Doug 

 
the degree 
with which we have product development and manufacturing development 
integrated is unique. And Model 3 already is a dramatically simpler car to 
build than the Model S and even many people in operations who have 
worked their 
career in volume manufacturers say the Model 3 is a huge step 
forward from anything that they've built. So as we go forward, Elon 
mentioned Model Y, a big part of our manufacturing capability is going to 
come from how simple we make our products.

Ford and then Apple.
 
Doug Field 
-

The model at Foxconn was very different where very quick product ramps 
and very high scale was achieved through manual processing of also what is 
fundamentally a product whose simplicity is orders of magnitude below ours. 
An iPad i
s less complicated than our center screen in many ways. So it's a 
very different order of magnitude in terms of the kind of product you're 
building and it's extremely manual because that is the way that you have to 
ramp very quickly, and then end the life 
of a product and bring up a new 
one.

comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. 
Your line is now open.
 
John Murphy

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Good afternoon. Shockingly, I want to follow up on the production of the 
Model 3. So seems like that's going to remain a hot topic 
here. Do you have 
enough experience with production of the Model 3 outside of the issues 
you're facing in the Gigafactory that you're confident once those problems 
are solved you can get up and running? Or is there sort of a contingency 
here that once you 
get that worked out, you'll be ramping up in Fremont and 
there might be other hurdles that are discovered? I'm just trying to 
understand if there's any incremental kinks that might come in the 
production process as you ramp up.
 
And then also, as we think a
bout the step from 5,000 to 10,000, is that 
something that can be done inside the Fremont factory? It sounds like you're 
confident that your density is much higher than what even Toyota and GM 
were producing out there potentially on capacity, but just curi
ous how those 
two (52:16).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
There's really 

 
there are only two things that I'm aware of that are 
constraints in production of varying significance. The module being the most 
significant, and then the parts conveyance, basicall
y the automated 
conveyance system that brings parts to the lines. The way that the Fremont 
factory is set up is that there's actually, on the ground floor we actually 
created two levels. The bottom level is all parts conveyance, parts coming 
from the wareh
ouse where the parts are sort of automatically stored and 
then are transferred to an automated conveyance system all the way to the 
line, the conveyance system being on the ground floor and then raised up to 
the line which is actually on kind of an artific
ial mezzanine.
 
And I think we can get 10,000 vehicles a week out of Fremont without a 
significant 

 
without creating really any new buildings of significance in the 
existing space. We will need to bring up the south paint shop, which is what 
we actually we
re using for S and X paint, and so we upgraded north paint to 
do S, X and 3. But with relatively small CapEx, like way less than we spent 
on north paint, we're confident we can bring south paint up to achieve the 
approximately 600,000 vehicle per year rate
. It's a combined 100,000 S and 
X; 500,000 3, which would be 20% to 30% more than Toyota and GM 
produced in the same facilities. I mean, we're a lot more vertically 
integrated as well.

As we think about that, though, Elon, (54:22) product limit in that plant? Or 
based on what you're really talking about here, could you get more out of 
that plant? Or a
s we look at the Model Y and its million
-
unit's capacity, we're 
definitively looking at a new facility?

I'm pretty excited about the Model Y stuff, and I think I want to present that 
in a more cohesive fashion. It's probably n
ot the next earnings call, but call 
it six months from now. But I'm really excited about the Model Y 
manufacturing and the design for manufacturing, like potentially how do we 
design out all the pain that we're currently going through. We do not want to 
ex
perience it again. There's really a lot of pain. I would have to say, the pain 
level is extremely high. I mean, I was in the factory, I was in the Gigafactory 
on Thanksgiving Day, as were many other Tesla people. It's hardcore, okay? 
Seven days a week. You
 
are on a (55:24) vacation. So we don't want to 
repeat that.

And then if I...

The 
material flow delivery that Elon mentioned, as we develop very high 
density and velocity lines, the limit starts to become how we get material to 
that line. We'll solve that for the Model 3 line, but eventually within three 
months, the limit to production 
may be how many trucks we can get in how 
quickly, both material (55:51).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Look, we use the Hyperloop for that.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Actually...

We are looking at building 
tunnels, using The Boring Company's thing 
(56:04), because we have, for example, our seats production is at a 
separate building on Page. And we have a bunch of trucks moving seats 
back and forth between both the primary Fremont production and the seat 
fact
ory. And we actually get constrained on how many trucks can we dock 
and undock at the seat factory, which is only, I don't know, half a mile or a 
mile away from the vehicle plant. So it'll be pretty easy to just have a 
tunnel, do an automated conveyance fr
om seats to the factory.
 
And there are things we can do, where we can build sub
-
systems and then 
transport sub
-
systems to Fremont. These things get increasingly difficult, 
but they're all doable. But I can see a path where we get to say 600,000 
Model 3 pro
duction and 100,000 S and X, so maybe 700,000, which should 
be like almost 50% more than GM or Toyota got out of the plant. I mean 
that seems achievable.

Can I sneak one in for Deepak? Apologies, Deepak. You did 
a great job with 
working capital in the quarter. I mean, I think some of us might kind of 
throw stones and say it might not be repeatable, but you did it and you got 
the cash in the door. So it's done and it was like that's some pretty good 
work here. How 
repeatable do you think the benefit from working capital is 
going forward? I mean, is this really just the benefit of negative working 
capital, and as you ramp up you'll get this cash inflow? And then also as we 
look at the customer deposits and the ZEV cr
edits, those were two, I think, 
apparently large cash inflows. I mean, how repeatable do you think those 
are in the future as well?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Some of those are not repeatable. We significantly reduced the 
finished goods inventory of 
S and X in Q4, which will not repeat itself going 
forward. And that was a huge impact on working capital. Customer deposits 
may not be as well, as you've pointed out. However, as the Model 3 ramp 
continues, the negative working capital needs for that, whic
h essentially 
create extra cash for us will be repeatable. And we'll continue to keep very 
tight controls on our accounts receivables and everything else we do to 
manage cash, to make sure we are being efficient.

Martin Viecha

Okay. Thank you very much. Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to get 
to everybody. But maybe one last question, please.
 
Operator
 
Our last question comes from the line of James Albertine with Co
nsumer 
Edge. Your line is now open.
 
James J. Albertine

Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Great. Thank you, and appreciate you sneaking me in. A topic doesn't get 
asked I think a lot or as much as it should, but we believe is maybe one of 
the reasons why the Mod
el S and X demand remains so high after many 
years of production is sort of the over
-
the
-
air updatability of these vehicles. 
I'm just wondering, it had been several quarters ago, kind of pre
-
Model 3 
questions we were hearing more about software you were ro
lling out to 
existing customers. Just wondering if you can give us some color on what 
level of uptake you're seeing. And I would imagine we're not seeing that in 
the upfront Model S and X margins, but potentially the some sort of 

 
those 
are vehicles that 
are earning assets for you in the future of sort of the 
customer ownership. So if you could kind of talk a little about what trends 
you're seeing there or elaborate a little on that, that would be helpful.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, I think 
probably the biggest item is as we get the software right, people 
upgrading to full self
-
driving capability of some S and X, and anything with 
Hardware 2, which is the eight cameras and more advanced ultrasonics and 
improved compute capability, I think wil
l be capable of the full self
-
driving. 
The full self
-
driving, the Hardware 2 type is also capable of doing easy swap 
out of the computer, so if it turns out we need additional computing 
capability to meet the regulatory standards for self
-
driving, particul
arly if it's 

 
like we think with the current computer hardware we can get to better 
than human, but the standard for regulators may be that you need to be five 
times better than human or something like that. But we believe that is 
solvable purely with com
puter hardware. And it would be a relatively minor 
expense to do that. So I think probably that's the biggest opportunity.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And along the same lines, not all customers take our enhanced Autopilot 
tool.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc
.
 
Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And as people hear more, we can see even an uptick on that. So but it's all 
around Autopilot, to your point.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, exactly. And that's assuming the sort of semi
-
automated driving doesn't 
defin
itely require any hardware upgrades. And that's $5,000 of 

 
that's 
potentially a software product provided with zero marginal cost and 100% 
margin. And then when full self
-
driving is available, we think probably that's 
more than a $3,000 increment. I think
 
maybe $5,000 increment or 
something like that.

Is there any data you can provide us though today in terms of the 
percentage of consumers that are upgrading or opting in, just to get a sense 
of kind of the or
der of magnitude, what that business could look like over 
time?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, that's 

 
well...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Not many people are opting in at this time.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
For the full self
-
driving since it does
n't actually work, essentially, people are 
buying an option on it, on it working in the future.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right.

Tesla, Inc.
 
So that's a (01:02:23) like trailer. There's also as I mentioned prior things 
that we expect ope
rate at kind of a shared autonomy fleet where Tesla's 
kind of like a combination of Uber or Lyft and Airbnb, I guess, like where you 
can opt to have your car enter a shared fleet or not, and then Tesla can also 
operate its own fleet in places where there's
 
not enough people sharing their 
vehicles. So that's a pretty significant opportunity.

8/3/18,Tesla,"Thanks, Martin. On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day 
showcasing our new in
-
house design full self
-
driving computer and our AI
-
based software trained by more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles. All Tesla class 
vehicles today have all the 
hardware necessary for full self
-
driving and over 
the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride
-
hailing 
network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a 
few days ago we think is somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 
a year, 
in some cases, perhaps more.
 
We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and 
batteries as well as our own in
-
house chip for full self
-
driving. We are in a 
position unlike anyone else in the industry. And in 2020, we expect to ha
ve 
1 million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self
-
driving. We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the 
market and perhaps 

 
yes. Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase 
in delivery volume in Europe
, similar to what North America experienced last 
year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China. As far 
as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles 
and consumers support them. This rapid increase in overs
eas volume 
strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global 
deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1. This was the most difficult 
logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
 
So I will say it again, lik
e we initially delivered the half of all vehicles 
produced or half of all deliveries occurred in literally the final 10 days of Q1. 
As a result, a large number of vehicles 

 
vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, 
which of course, Q1 net income to be negativel
y impacted. As we said, we 
could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time. The response to 
this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills 
throughout the quarter. This will make the 

 
this will put much less strain on 
Te
sla, results in a much better delivery experience for customers and have a 
very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
 
In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best
-
selling premium car in the U.S., 
outselling the runner up by almost 6

a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made 
several years ago. There are literally 

 
best knowledge zero predictions that 
this would happen if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, an 
electric car 
would be the best
-
selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time 
we will be the best
-
selling premium car throughout the world. And in fact, in 
Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period 
ever. And that w
ould be something similar in Switzerland as well. So, this is 
really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
 
Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only 70% of 
previous Model 3 have actually been non
-
premium vehicles, where pe
ople 
actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car. They never 
anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 
more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a 
Model 3. And keep in mind,
 
global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun 
and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are 
continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including 
updating the Model S and X production line to culm
inate the next generation 
of powertrains. So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in 
production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S 
and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active 
adaptive damping in 
the suspension system and to enable charging at 200 
kilowatts, which is 

 
and there are number of other small changes. If anyone 
is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it. 
And we also introduced a loyalty program, where 
if somebody is an existing 
Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model S or X, they get their first 
upgrade for free. So this is 

 
yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to 
existing Tesla customers.
 
So, they have a longer range. The Model S now has a ran
ge of 370 miles. 
This would actually be at a range of 370 miles and Motor Trend test drove 
the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way from San Francisco to 
Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even 
gone faster and th
ey were any headwind as well. So, this is pretty 
remarkable that electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities 
in California. I mean, I have never 

 
back when I was driving gasoline cars, I 
always have to stop at the gas station. This is lit
erally better than a gasoline 
car with the rare exception. And there is also an increase in power, 
accelerates faster, just better in every way. And we are able to increasing 
the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team 
and for
 
us to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a 
significant margin.
 
So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as 
well as continued expansion of Model 3 globally, we expect the order rate to 
increase signific
antly throughout the year and in commensurate with our 
production levels. And I am very excited about the future for other products, 
especially for full self
-
driving, which will fundamentally transform transport 
as we know it. The Tesla Semi truck Model Y,
 
improvements to Powerwall, 
Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version 3 on the energy side. And no question in 
my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer 
product company in the world. And finally, I want to thank our employees 
for the
ir incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zachary would like to have some 
remarks as well.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well. Overall, as we 
reflect on the 
progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can 

standards. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the 
quarter. We launched 
the standard range lineup for Model 3 product 
retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk about and 
suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments 
and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in 
del
iverable cars. So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss 
briefly and then we will open it up to Q&A around cash and profitability for 
the quarter.
 
First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash 
equivalents on hand. 
This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending 
cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two factors. The first is that 
we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of you 
looking to the cash flow statement, $188 mil
lion of this is flowing through 
our operating cash flows. The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more 
than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 
operations overseas. And the two components to this which we have 
discussed is tha
t an international operation naturally commands additional 
working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our 
delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of 
these factors which occurred in Q1. We do not
 
expect to repeat in Q2 and we 
expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward. I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of 
deliveries from month 1 in the history of the company.
 
On the working capit
al point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 
occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized 
international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds 
in the second half. This led to a binary inf
low of Model 3 cars to EMEA and 
China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. We also faced 
important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that 
also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks in the 
qua
rter. So, we are addressing this by regionally 

 
by building regionally 
balanced and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will 
be implemented in the next week or two. The secondary benefit of this is 
that it enables us to run stable ope
rations throughout the quarter. So, we 

fleet. We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
 
On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one
-

th
rough to net income. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing 
adjustments that we announced on February 28. This included a reserve for 
a potential increase to return it for a residual value guarantee and buyback 
guarantee of vehicles and also a
n adjustment for the inventory value of our 
used Tesla inventory and service volumes. There is an additional $67 million 
related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
 
Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here i
s that 
automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to 
the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted. If you adjust for this, the 
decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in 
deliveries. Within autom
otive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined 
slightly to approximately 20%. This is due to two factors. One is the pricing 
adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as the makeshift towards 
the standard range lineup which we launched. We also su
ccessfully executed 
on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content 
warehousing and scrap are the examples of double
-
digit improvements from 
Q4 to Q1. In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note 
that North Amer
ican ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our 
orders being from long
-
range bearings of Model 3. In S and X, the impact on 
margin was more significant. Two major pieces here is the volume reduction 
led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so 
that impacted our margin as 
well as the pricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and 
X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational 
improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 

excitement of our product lineup. From a financial standpoint, what we have 
effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets 
that we can quickly 
scale and replicate into different products around the 
world. So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in 
the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared 
to Model 3 in the U.S. and then 50% our internal f
orecast that we are 
executing against is actually better than that. And Model Y, as we have 
noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we are able to leverage the 
knowledge there for capital efficient expansion. In energy as well, as we 
have noted previou
sly, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting 
improvements coming there and the expansion will help improve margin as 
we can better utilize some of the assets that we planned investments in 
that.
 
So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I 
personally never felt more 
excited about the future of the company and I am looking forward to the 
discussion.

shareholders who have been submitting their questions on 
say.com. So, the 
first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase of Maxwell 
Technologies? What is holding that back?
 
Elon Musk
 
Jonathan, do you want to?
 
Jonathan Chang
 

t 
going through approvals with the SEC. There is not a whole lot of things 
holding it back. We are on schedule, we are on track. Right now, we are 
looking to close in mid
-
May.
 
Elon Musk
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. The second question is, is Tes
la considering and creating an 
insurance program in order to further simplify the ownership experience and 
to more accurately take into account safety of driving in Autopilot? The 
insurance market is very unreliable for Tesla ownership right now.
 
Elon Musk
 
The answer is, yes, we are creating a Tesla insurance product and we hope 
to launch that in about a month. It will be much more compelling than 
anything else out there.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, Elon, most people when 
they think of Tesla only see it as an automotive company. Can you speak to 
the energy side of the company specifically, the roadmap for when you see 
the energy side of things really t
aking off and generating major revenue for 
the company?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. The challenge really is battery cells scarcity. As far as the additional 
storage is concerned, we basically need an up
-
sell to support the vehicle 
production as well as to full power o
n Powerpack. Last year, in order to have 
enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the 
Gigafactory to produce cells just for Model 3 as opposed to Powerpack. So 
we are essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to
 
continue 
some level of production on the Powerpack. This year, we think that we will 
be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs like current, 
J.B., like what do you guys think?
 
J.B. Straubel
 
Yes, between 5% and 10%, something like that.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So, there are [indiscernible] in a Powerwall in the car so that translates 
to a 

 
quite a decent number of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to 
use cells from variety of suppliers around the world. The Powerwall 

t have to go through vehicle [indiscernible] are 
much more adaptable to using variety of cells from other cell providers. So, 
we expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant 
percentage growth this year maybe on the order of 300% or some qu
ite high 
number. Sorry, sorry. Yes, 300, confirming it, 300%. So this is a very big 

we expect that sort of growth rate would hopefully be able to continue and 
then battery storage w

business over time. We also have 

 
we are also finding a significant increase 
in retrofit solar this year, because we have finally refined the product 

 
and much more cost 
efficient to deliver and install. So, to radically streamline process from what 
has been done before and we will have more to say on that possibly next 
week. And then the Solar Roof tile, we are on Version 3 of the design. That 
necessar
ily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confident that 
the Solar Roof is going to last on the order of 30 years and because the 
warranty is sort of 20, 25 years and so the rate at which you can iterate on 
Solar Roof is necessarily slowed down b
y [indiscernible] which you can do 
accelerate aging on the roof and we want the installation process to be 
simple and easy, which is actually the Tesla Buffalo factory a few weeks ago 
and I was pretty impressed with the team and we are looking forward to 
s
caling that up significantly through the balance of this year and next.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. The next question comes from Jeffrey, when and 
where will the Tesla semi production begin?
 
Jerome Guillen
 
This is Jerome. Next year we will start pro
duction. We are very happy with 
driving the trucks extensively with I think so far quite amazing success, yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
The prototypes are working amazingly well.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Yes, very well. We just used them all the time. We load them to maximum 
weigh
t and continue to make improvements.
 
Elon Musk
 
So, we have even used them to deliver some Model 3s.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Yes, that was fun. So, yes, we will start production next year. The location 

eries and 
driving it in Reno.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Thank you very much.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sparks technically.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Sparks, yes. Northern Nevada.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, Northern Nevada.
 
Martin Viecha
 
And perhaps the last question from retail, how soon 
should current owners 
that purchase FSD, get the new FSD computer?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think from features and functionality standpoint, I think there is no point 

about 2 or 3 months. That

materially different from the feature set available on the Version 2 hardware. 
So, just no need to rush to the 

 

months before it becomes relevant and then it wi
ll obviously increase rapidly 
from then. One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this 
exclusive especially. For Model Y production, we are right now trying to 
decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada 
and we exp
ect to make a final decision on that very soon. But in the 
meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for 


and California as to whether 
we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and 
we will hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
 
Ryan Brinkman
 
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Your guidance for 90,000 to 100,000 2Q 
deliveries when combined with the full year o
utlook, it suggests somewhere 
between 35% and 45% sequential growth from the first half to the second. 
Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth 
and in particular what the order book or reservation list maybe telling you?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and 3. The standard 
range plus Model 3 with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly 
compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like 
the top 40% income earn


 
I think we will 
see a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the 
upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there 
would be an S, X upgrade and this really is kind of a 
game
-
changer of an 
upgrade. So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to 
see that to be quite significant. And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 

getting pas
t the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the 
U.S. on December 31. So, these were all very positive factors. We also have 
just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, 
especially for Model 3. So we will be really 
saying the right
-
hand drive Model 
3 and expect to see significant demand in right
-
hand drive countries. 
Overall, I feel really good about the way things are headed.
 
Ryan Brinkman
 
Okay, thanks. And then my follow up, sorry, as you said on previous call, 
you
 
indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont, because it was I 
think you said packed to the gills. I heard today that it is now a close call 
between California and Nevada. Is anticipated demand for Fremont built 
vehicles less than was previously tho
ught or have you managed to maybe 
find more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other 
production method?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, first of all, obviously on account of tents, like I mean, we like hardcore 
tents, so I am not like Cub Scout tents,
 
which are fine, but this is actually 

 
credit goes to Tesla team, because they actually look at how could we do 
this in Fremont if we had to and we feel like we can actually append building 
space to the 

 
to the west side of the building and use a lot of 
internal space 

believe it actually can be done with minimal disruption to add Model Y to 
Fremont.
 
Ryan Brinkman
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferra
gu with New Street 
Research.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Hey, thanks for the call. My first question is really on the Model S and Model 
X and Elon, you said you are comfortable with the one you see 

 
based on 
what you saw in April, do you think that the 25,000 units pe
r quarter is the 
level of demand that is where you see the market coming back already or 
are we not there yet? And more specifically, in the U.S., the pull forward in 
Q4 probably hurt a lot of demand for S and X? Is that something that we still 
see the num
bers today in recent weeks or is that behind us? And I have a 
follow
-
up on Q2.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean, I think something like 

 
returning to the 100,000 a year 


 

guess. And sorry, what was the other point?
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Yes. My question was about like the run
-
rate of demand you see at the 
moment, do you still feel like weak demand in the U.S. because of the pull 
f
orward in Q4 or do you think demand returned to normal already?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think we expect demand to 

 
we are seeing demand returning to normal in 


but my impression right now is that demand is quite 
solid, quite strong, yes.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
And then my second question was briefly on...
 
Elon Musk
 
Sorry, Zach would like to...
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. Well, just one thing I wanted to add to that, just on 
the production side 
of S and X. We did reduce production in Q1 as was noted. That was part of 
the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with 
the improved suspension and we are in the process of increasing production 
backup over
 
the course of Q2. So just for the pervasive expectations, we will 
exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and then 

 
Pierre Ferragu
 
And my follow
-
up was really on Q
2 like with 90,000 to 100,000 units you are 


 
you just 
still expect a loss. So maybe if you could take us through where we will see 
in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a pro
fit for similar 
volumes? How much of the loss in 2Q will be one
-
off costs, how much is the 
price points coming down in the mix and how much is related to pricing and 
other things?
 
Elon Musk
 

he wave 
where we, yes, made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively 
for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North 
America. And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether 

oast, then we could deliver more cars. But we think 
it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of 
optimizing for one quarter, but really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and 
not just 

 
not being a good expense for customers and p
retty aggressive 
efforts from Tesla team. So if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, 
I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind this crazy wave 
of deliveries and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not 
hav
e the wave. And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other 
items?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. No, I think you summarized it well, Elon. Two other things that I would 
add. One is we did make pricing adjustments to our products in Q1, which 
puts press

teams are working extremely hard and making terrific progress on improving 
the cost efficiency of the business without sacrificing growth and that in 
combination with the efficiencies from un
winding the wave, is where we feel 
we will be comfortable returning to a place of profitability in Q3 once all of 
those pieces are in place.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Thank you.
 
Martin Viecha
 

 
Operator
 
Our next quest
ion is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Thanks. First question, Elon, a couple of days ago, I asked you how safe is 
the Autopilot technology and you said something like twice as safe as normal 
driving, but you seem to be in a really unique p
osition to really collect 
exobytes of data, you could potentially be externally validated much more 
rigorously provided the regulatory body or insurance institute to just show 
how much safer Autopilot is. When could we expect to see Tesla do that, 
that typ
e of validation that investors could also get a sense of? It seems 
really, really important for adoption. Thanks. And I have a follow up.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think we are just going to continue to report the absolute numbers. I think 
a point of detail just give th
ose of you our bytes of Tesla that maybe sort of 
like data mine the situation and then try to turn it positive into negative. So 
we are just going to keep reporting report. We do give some more detailed 
information to insurance companies to help with rates
. And obviously as we 
launch our own insurance product next month, we will certainly incorporate 
that information into the insurance rates. So, we essentially have a 
substantial price and sort of arbitrage or information arbitrage opportunity 
where we have
 
direct knowledge of the risk profile of customers and based 
on the car and then if they want to buy Tesla insurance, they would have to 
agree to not drive the car in a crazy way. Or they can, but then their 
insurance rates are higher. So we are just going
 
to keep reporting the 
numbers at a broad stroke level, which I think is really what matters.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Okay, I understand it.
 
Elon Musk
 

 
Adam Jonas
 
Okay. And just as a follow
-
up, Elon and you kind of alluded a little bit, there 
is 

the outside at least, it looks like a huge distraction. And at the same time, 
there is so much alternative capital and large amounts of strategic capital 
that is incrementally deploy
ed in domains where Tesla has real leadership. 
So how important is it for Tesla to be a publicly traded company, Elon?
 
Elon Musk
 

but unfortunately, I think that ship has sailed, 
so...
 
Adam Jonas
 

being public? Is there just only so much you can do and you just got to play 

 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I think this feels like the sort of price of the st
ock is being set in kind of 
a manic
-

perhaps being a publicly traded company is like having someone stand at 
the edge of your home and then just randomly yell different prices for your 
house 

 
Adam Jonas
 
Yes.
 
Elon Musk
 

 
Adam Jonas
 
Okay understood. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.
 
Maynard Um
 
Hi thanks. In the update letter, you talked about supplier limitations 
impacting production. Can you just talk about what that was and how long 
you think that might continue to impact you? And then I have a follow up.
 
Elon Musk
 

e think we have two supplier interruptions, at least the 

 
Maynard Um
 
Okay. And I guess there was some concern out there that Model 3 was 
cannibalizing S and X despite them being all different vehicle classes, and it 
doe

had any evidence that proves, disproves this? Any thoughts there would be 
helpful.
 
Elon Musk
 

 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And also, 
not only 3.5% of our trade
-
ins for Model 3 are coming from Model 

-
ins, Model S accounts for a super, 
super tiny portion.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, for sure. People Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or 
maybe an 
X.

Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.
 
Dan Galves
 
Hi thanks everybody. A couple of questions. One, you mentioned a $50,000 
ASP for North America 
Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on 
kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments? Is 

current order flow since those price adjustments?
 
Z
achary Kirkhorn
 
Yes, this is Zach. I mean, what we saw on February 28 when we launched 

-
up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was 
announced. And then as 
more time has passed and order rates have 

week ever since as the order rates stabilizes. And just under $50,000 ASP 

abilize there. 

seeing in North America is that over 50% of our orders of the long
-
range 
variance in ASPs [indiscernible].
 
Dan Galves
 

now order questions have been 
asked before, but let me put it this way. So, the I imagine that S and X 
orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades. But on 
Model 3, whatever your assumption is within the 90,000 to 100,000 Q2 
deliverie
s, whatever that assumption is for Model 3, does your current order 
flow support that? Or do you need something kind of positive to happen over 
the course of the quarter to get there?
 
Elon Musk
 

any major thing 
required.
 
Dan Galves
 
Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes, thank you. Elon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole 
notion of raising capit
al for about the last year, you sort of shooed it as 
almost an evil thing and I think a lot of investors believe that the company 
might be better served and its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had 
a stronger cash base. And given that you used
 
up about $2 billion worth of 

space while trying to grow quickly and be self
-
funding, which, quite frankly, 
may be unrealistic. So why not raise capital? And why do you view that 
as 

please.
 
Elon Musk
 


importan
t to have strong financial discipline of the company and just to 

with capital. If we keep raising capital every time, then it just takes we now 
have the forcing function improving the 
functional operation of the business. 
So, I think it is healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while. At this point, I do 

probably about the right timing, but yes.
 
Toni Sacconagh
i
 
So, does that mean that investors should expect the capital raise in the near 
to medium term? And I hear you on the force and constraint, but I mean 
growth does eat cash especially in a capital
-
intensive business. If you really 
do believe you have a firs

it as quickly as possible even if it meant raising capital in the short term.
 
Elon Musk
 

our growth thus far and the type of
 
those fund in fact, if there was a final 

important as company scales to make sure we are on a solid foundation and 

ghout the 
company and are spending money very efficiently. At this point, I think we 


improvements across the b

raising capital at this point.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 

on being more efficient and how we spend money has really changed the full 
trends
 
of the company. It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost 
reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements 
in operating expenses as well. And then as we look forward to capital 
investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimat
ely our European 
facility, our CapEx capacity has come down significantly through the work of 
the team here. So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.
 
Elon Musk
 
And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the 
Shanghai Giga 

have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.

Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
 
Alex Potter
 
Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges 
were a headwind in the quarter. You talked about trying to regionally 
balance your deliveries going forward. Is that b
asically saying that people in 
Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their 

order to...
 
Elon Musk
 
No, they would actually receive their cars sooner. It just me
ans that instead 
of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just 
dedicated to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North 
American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout 
the world, th

want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the 
cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same time. We literally 

eries were in the final 10 days of 


redeploy like fuel from that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering
, 
everyone just to deliver cars. And then we then they can do their regular 
jobs. So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to 
demand throughout the quarter.
 
Alex Potter
 
Okay. That makes sense. Then the second question, I guess on go to
 
market, there were some period of time there where the company was 
focused on closing storefronts. A fair amount of noise made around that. 
And then it, look like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy. I 

 
there. If you have that, that would 
be helpful. Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 


misunderstanding. We certainly will con
tinue to have stores, and we will 
continue to add stores provided they are in locations where there is high foot 
traffic and that are in our target market. So, we actually will continue to add 
stores in locations are no
-
brainers. We will close stores in lo
cations where 
they are incredibly hard to find and the foot traffic of potential buyers is very 
low such that it does not support the cost of the store and the people in it. 

eve
n if you go into a store, you we would guide you to order the car on your 
phone. So, source essentially like there like information centers, place you 
can get a test drive and buy some Tesla merchandise, that kind of thing. But 

an all stores are closed. Just means when you 
buy a car, you always do it on your phone in the store or at home or

Philippe Houchois
 

comment on the agreement you seem to have reached with FCA on the 
possibility of selling your
 
CO2 credits to them in Europe and what that 
means to your potential cash inflow. When that might start occurring? And if 
there is any chance any of those things are in your Q1 cash position?
 
Elon Musk
 

 
agreed with FCA not to 
comment on it publicly so we must abide by that.
 
Philippe Houchois
 
And can I ask you a question of coming back to what Adam was saying 

some of it by disclosing 
on a monthly basis your deliveries and also maybe 
disclosing early your greenhouse revenue instead of just reserves so we get 
right away a better view on some of these details that kind of move the 
stock.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think that would actually be counterpro
ductive because people read too 
much into what occurred in a month. I mean, even at a quarterly basis, 


makes sens

affected by when the ship arrives. And so, if the ship arrives on the 31st of 
the month or the first of the next month, this will make it look like 
something dramatic has happened. But
 
actually, the ship was just a day 
late. So, people read that would increase the drama, not decrease it.

probably some timing with deliveries that could have help
ed it towards the 
end of the quarter. But we would have thought it would have increased 
given the Model Y [indiscernible]. So, our question is what was the initial 
order intake for the Model Y? And just coming through combing some of 
your comment earlier, 
what daily order rate are you seeing right now for the 
rest of your products?

Joseph Spak
 
First question is really just a clarification on in the outlook of 25% non

GAAP 

g. Is that over the mid
-
term or is that 
something you expect to hit by the end of this year? And if so, what gets S 
and X back higher given the price cuts?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 

the year, although internally, we are working towards S and X non
-
GAAP 
gross margin achieving that sooner. The biggest lever there is actually two 
components. One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production 

 
there from the fixed cost absorption which 
will help us. But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place 


n increased take 
rate on our full Self
-
Driving offering. And there are, revenue associated with 
that given that the full suite of functionality is not there. And as that option 
becomes, approaches we roll out more, we will be able to apply more 
revenue on 
that. So all of these things together within our internal gives us 
[indiscernible].
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually 
launched in a significant cost down because we essentially took the high 

 
driving units of the Model 3 which is extremely efficient 
magnet motor and product electronics and we made a version for that for 

while improving range and [indiscernible] of 

 
Joseph Spak
 
Okay. The second question is just looking at the 10
-

billion purchase obligation, which I think is primarily related to Panasonic 

indicated 
production constraints. I guess the question is, does that $4.9 billion 

because of production constraints, does that adjust?
 
Unidentified Company Speaker
 
This is [indisce
rnible]. So, the purchase obligation in the 10

need to hit. I mean, make the purchases tomorrow. So this is going to take 
a couple of years.

Okay.

erator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.
 
Colin Langan
 
Great thanks for taking my question I mean, it sounds like from the tone of 

product, but margins seem
 
to be under pressure and typically automakers 
stop pricing when there is a demand issue. So, what is the logic of the price 
cuts during the quarter?
 
Elon Musk
 

company, is to make o
ur cars as affordable as possible. And we thought it 
was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 and then to create a sort of 
bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we think 
actually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite imp
ortant more people 
realizing in range and posher interior and Autopilot. So, we thought a 

Model 3 is just really nail the sweet spot and raising consumer response 
accordingly. You c
an tell by the $35,000 version of the Model 3 that, of 



you have to complete the obstacle 
course or something. But we see very few people actually take us up on that 

 
Colin Langan
 

 
year. Are you still confident in the 3,000 per week? And do you have a

Yes, the Shanghai Gigafactory progress is going incredibly well. Tesla the 
execution of our team underground there. I get daily e
-

important to bear in mind. So, we have 99% of things in good shape can 



it looks like to be the case

Giga.

Sure thing. Our first phone question will come from the line of Dan Galves 
with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Daniel V. Galves

Credit Suisse Securities (

Good afternoon. Thanks. So, if we assume Model S volume of 50,000 in 
2015 deliveries need to average over 14,000 per quarter in Q3 and Q4, 
what's the biggest challenge to get there? And do
 
you have order rates 
today that support that level of volume in the back half?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. So, yeah, I mean, that's about right. I mean, actually with Model X 
production ramping up quite heavily in Q4 dependi
ng upon how that ramp 
goes and obviously it's difficult to predict that with perfect clarity, but our 
volume essentially doubles in Q4. So depending upon how the ramp goes. 
So, I do want to emphasize that, like sometimes people don't totally 
appreciate is 
that, there are several thousand unique parts in a car and if 
even one of those parts is not available for any reason, then you cannot 
ship, you cannot scale production.
 
So essentially, the production ramp goes according to the unluckiest and 
worst perform
ing supplier or project of Tesla. But that said we do expect to 
see a significant ramp in Q4 for the X and have something that may be as 
much 2X other quarters and in Q4. And as far as demand for that, we do not 
see that being a problem. Obviously, there a
re huge advance orders for the 
X, and we see a steady climb in demand for the S. So...
 
Daniel V. Galves 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA
) LLC (Broker)
 
Okay. Got it. And then just to follow
-
up, you've impro
ved the Model S a 
whole lot in the last couple of years. Does that make it easier to launch 
Model X at a high
-
quality level? And does it allow you to move engineering 
and design resources towards Model 3 faster than you moved resources to 
Model X?
 
Elon Ree
ve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. In the case of the X, the X ended up being a lot more different than 
the S than we originally anticipated. So the development took a lot longer 
and we were distracted solving all sorts of issues with the S
 
during that time 
which made it difficult for us to allocate engineering resources to the X, 
when there were issues to be solved with the S.
 
So I think we'll do a lot better with the X and we're paying close attention to 
some of the things that are differe
nt about the X to make sure that they're 
not an issue, particularly the falcon wing door and the second row seats. And 
yes, I'm feeling pretty good about things.
 
But because that production ramp just scales exponentially, depending upon 
where that exponent
ial curve falls across a quarterly boundary, can actually 
make quite a significant effect on the production and deliveries in that 
quarter. That's why it's like a lot easier to predict if it's continuous than if it's 
discrete with arbitrary quarterly cut
-
o
ffs.
 
But I really think the X is really going to be a great car. And I just drove the 
latest prototype today and it's like wow. But this is by far the best SUV.

Go ahead, Huey. Next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Yes, sir. Next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of 
America Merrill 
Lynch. Please go ahead your line is now open.
 
John D. Lovallo 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my call as well. First question is, do 
you guys earn 4 ZEV credits or 9 ZEV credits per vehicle and how many 
vehicles are p
articipating in your battery swap beta program?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
The amount of ZEV credits we earn depends on the size of the pack, 
different for what we're doing for the 60 versus 85, and now the new ones at 
70. That has been
 
varying over time, the amount of ZEV credits we earn. 
So, I'll need to confirm that before I give the official number here.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, the ZEV credits thing is not like 

 
I mean, it sort of moves things 
ab
out like 2%. It's like not super material. So I'm not sure what the point of 
your question is.
 
John D. Lovallo 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Well, yeah, here's the point of the question is that assuming that you guys 
sell 10,000 vehicles in ZEV 
states this year, that would mean that you would 
need 400 vehicles involved in this battery swap program, if you assume that 
each of them swap 25 times each, so a minimum of 400 vehicles. So, I'm 
just curious if there are 400 vehicles involved in the batte
ry swap program?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I mean, you do realize that ZEV credits don't sell for 100 ZEVs per $1. 
They sell for like $0.50 or sometimes less. And there are not always 
customers for the ZEV credits. So...
 
Jo
hn D. Lovallo 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Yeah. I'm just asking about in terms of what you guys are actually earning 
per vehicle. Okay. And I guess the next...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's not a big deal. Yeah. And as more 
of our production goes overseas, 
obviously, there are no ZEV states overseas and as our sales increase 
outside of California, also that 

 
or Canada there, but those are not ZEV 
states, so this is like, the ZEV stuff is like an increasingly small part of th
e 
picture over time.
 
John D. Lovallo 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. That's fair. Go ahead.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
We do have hundreds of vehicles in the battery swap pilot program...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executi
ve Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
...it's not like 10 or something like that, it's hundreds of vehicles.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, we've steadily increased the invitation list. We just found li
ke there 
just is not a lot of interest in people doing pack swap. So, we make the 
invitations and we get a very small percentage of that actually take us up on 
the invitation.
 
John D. Lovallo 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Right. The only point is there's
 
a difference of five ZEV credits per vehicle, 
that was the only point. Second question, would be and final question. There 
is some news report saying that SolarCity has said that they're not going to 
use the 7
-
kilowatt hour battery, in fact, I think there
 
was a quote from a 
spokesman, whether it's true or not, we don't know, saying that it doesn't 
make economic sense. I mean, could you guys just comment on that please?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I mean, let me just talk more
 
broadly about the response to the 
Powerwall and Powerpack because I don't think that's really the question 
you should be asking. The response has been overwhelming, okay, like 
crazy. In the course of like less than a week, we've had 38,000 reservations 
fo
r the Powerwall, 2,500 reservations for Powerpack. The Powerpack, it 
should be noted, typically this is bought by utilities or large industrial 
companies for heavy industrial work. So, typically Powerpack, it's like at 
least 10 Powerpacks per installation.
 
So if there's 2,500 reservations, 
actually 25,000 Powerpacks.
 
Powerwall also we suspect is probably an average of number of Powerpacks, 
it's probably 1.5 to 2 per installation. So, 38,000 reservations is more, like 
50,000 or 60,000 actual Powerwalls.
 
So, 
I mean, there's, like, no way that we could possibly satisfy this demand 
this year and we're basically like sold out through the middle of next year in 
the first week. It was just crazy. We had 2,500 requests from companies 
that want to distribute and inst
all the Powerwall and Powerpack. We can't 
even respond to them. We have to, like, triage our response to those who 
want to be a distributor.
 
So, it's like crazy off the hook. Yeah. And it seems to have gone super viral. 
For the specific case of SolarCity, 
what they are referring to is that there's 
two versions of the Powerwall. There is the daily cycling version and there is 
the Power backup version. One is energy optimized and one is daily
-
cycling
-
optimized.
 
For the daily
-
cycling
-
optimized one, the economi
cs, it is true in the U.S. with 
rare exception are more expensive than utility. So if somebody wants to do 
a daily cycling, basically go off grid. It's going to be more expensive than 
being on grid. This doesn't mean that people won't buy it because there 
are 
people who want to go off grid on principle, or they just want to be 
independent. And that's what the SolarCity comment is about.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. It might also be worth noting that SolarCity doesn't yet operate in 
E
urope and the main target application for the daily cycling battery pack was 
actually were several markets not in the Continental U.S. and particularly 
Germany and Australia are very strong markets where it does make 
economic sense today based on the feed 
in tariff and the electricity rate 
structures in those countries. So, SolarCity's comments I think need to be 
sort of put in the regional context.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. SolarCity is only operating in the U.S. And I 
mean, the Powerwall, it 
will be available from SolarCity and from other installers in both 
configurations. But if someone is doing a daily cycling application, they're 
doing it out of 

 
because they specifically want grid independence and there 
are some nu
mber of people who will want to do that and that's good.
 
And it's also important to appreciate even for say the power backup systems 
that you always have power in the event of power outage, if like let's say 
that appeal to like 2% of households in the U.S.
 
or 1%, that's 1 million 
households, like it is 1 person in a 100 care about having battery backup in 
the event of a utility outage, probably. We couldn't even support a small 
fraction of that right now. So, it's kind of a moot point.

Okay. John, I hope that answers your questions. Huey, I guess, we're ready 
for the next question then.
 
Operator
 
Sure thing. Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty & 
Company. Please go ahead with your 
questions please.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to build on the Tesla energy 
conversation. What are your revenue and gross margin targets on that 
business and how do we look at the 2015 ramp?
 
Elon Reeve M
usk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I mean, the gross margin and revenue obviously is going to change 
with time. So when it's low volume, made in Fremont, it will be relatively low 
margin. Once we get Gigafactory up and running, and high volume 
and get 
the economies of scale working, this is just a guess, right now, but I mean, 
like, maybe it's somewhere around 20% because this is not like 

 
it's like we 
just don't have enough information to say exactly what that would be. But 
probably 20% is a r
easonable guess.
 
And then, in terms of volume, I mean, we're going to try to scale it as fast 
as we can 

 
as the slowest manufacturing constraint. So, I mean, it's easier 
to say what's the long term without saying like exactly which quarter is it 
going to 
be in. I don't know. But I think, we'll see demand for stationary 
storage as measured in sort of megawatt hours or gigawatt hours to be 
approximately double that of the car. But that's our best guess for long
-
term 
demand. Yeah.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougher
ty & Co. LLC
 
How do we think about your capacity or even your cost of per kilowatt hour 
because it's different than a car, right? The duty load is way different for a 
stationary storage application. So could you just educate us a little bit on 
how we look 
at analyzing that business and the difference between that and 
the energy needs of the car business per pack?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, there is two applications which are quite different, one is backup 
power or peak up (15
:59), sort of the equivalent, the only utility scale is like 
peaker plant, which is a high
-
energy application and then there's the daily 
cycler application. There are different chemistries depending upon which one 
you have. So the backup power chemistry is
 
quite similar to the car, which is 
like nickel
-
cobalt
-
aluminum
-
cathode, the daily cycling control constituent is 
nickel
-
manganese
-
cobalt, so there's quite a lot of manganese in there and 
one is meant for call it, maybe, 60 or 70 cycles per year, and the o
ther one 
is meant for daily deep cycling, so it's 365 cycles a year.
 
And the daily cycler one, I mean, we expect it to be able to daily cycle for 
something on the order of 15 years. Actually the warranty period would be a 
little bit less than that. But we 
expect it to be something that's in the kind of 
5,000 cycle range capability, whereas the high
-
energy pack is more like 
around the maybe depending upon on how it's used anywhere from 1,000 
cycles to 1,500 cycles. And they have comparable calendar lives, an
d for the 
high energy one, it's important to appreciate that this actually has a lot of 
interest from utilities because utilities have to maintain these things for 
peaker plants, and like when there's like a sharp increase in usage.
 
You can imagine the hig
hest energy day in California on a hot summer day 
where there's a heat wave, the energy consumption there is very high 
compared to a pleasant spring night where nobody is air
-
conditioning or 
heating is on or for very little and, like commerce is not happen
ing and 
people are asleep and lights are off. That can be a huge delta. Depending 
upon the situation, it can be anywhere from, like, a 5x to 10x difference.
 
So then having a battery pack that can take out those like very sort of weird 
sharp peaks. like the
 
heat wave day, you could either have a battery pack 
which requires basically no maintenance and doesn't require any fuel and it's 
going to peak shave those really troublesome days or you could have, like, a 
power plant that requires fuel and maintenance a
nd it's got to be 

 
it's 
always going to be maintained and it takes time, you can't just start it up in 
3 seconds, like you've got to have a little bit of notice. But the high energy 
pack is actually very economically competitive in those sort of situation
s.
 
And then the high cycling pack is really great for 

 
if you've got some sort of 
wind or solar situation, that's where the high
-
cycling one is really great on 
the utility scale. And I should say like the most of our stationary storage 
sales to be at the 
utility or heavy industrial scale, it's probably 

 
and just a 
guess because early days 

 
5 to 10 times more megawatt hours will be 
deployed at the utility in heavy industrial scale than at the consumer scale.
 
Andrea Susan James

Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So the Powerpack would be the one that's like the heavy duty, like the big 
production sales one, not so much the Powerwall. Powerwall is great, but 
like I said, it's probably only 10% to 20% that the siz
e of the Powerpack 
demand.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. Maybe one point on the cost structure. There's definitely a lot of 
commonality in the supply chain and even in the manufacturing base on how 
we do the modules and sales for the
 
Tesla Energy products along with the 
vehicle products. So as we ramp up production on the Tesla Energy 
products, there definitely are benefits to the vehicle costs of energy storage 
from scale and from just generally moving more material and kilowatt hour
s 
through that whole chain. So both businesses benefit each other.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I mean, clearly, given the very high demand that we're seeing for 
Tesla Energy products, we're actually trying to figure out if we
 
can go from 
like our current production target of like 35
-
gigawatt hours at the cell level 
and 50 at the pack level in our Nevada plant to maybe 50% more than that 
or even higher because just the sheer volume of demand here is just 
staggering. We could ea
sily have the entire Gigafactory just do stationary 
storage.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Right. So, you have some capacity. I think you've said maybe 15% of your 
capacity might be reserved for stationary storage. Maybe I've read that in an 
article somewhere, I'm not sure.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
A 15
-
gigawatt hours or a third of the 50
-
gigawatt hours that targeted at the 
pack level.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief
 
Executive Officer
 
So the 15% is the 15
-
gigawatt hours or roughly 30%.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Okay. And you might add now 

 
maybe you're looking at doing another 50% 
and growing the capacity 50%. You have the space, I guess, there in 
Neva
da to do that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We do. I don't want to make that a prediction, but that seems like the thing 
we should do. So, we're investigating that. It seems like the logical thing to 
do. So we're going to probably t
ry to do that. Yeah, because, like, we're 
fairly confident at this point like so that the entire Gigafactory output could 
just do stationary storage. I mean it's like, wow, okay. Well, we need to 
make cars too, so we're just trying to make the factory bigg
er. That's like 
the total logic. It's lot more complicated than that.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
But given the choice between making 

 
sorry, then I'll get off. Thank you so 
much for your time. But given the choice between making a pack for a
 
car 
and making a pack for a stationary storage application, how do you pick 
which one gets the priority?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I guess, we'd pick cars because we got this whole other plant here in 
Fremont making cars. 
So, cars will get the priority. Yeah. That would be a 
logical priority. And yeah, but I mean, it really feels like, man, the stationary 
storage demand is just nutty. Like worldwide, it's just crazy.
 
Andrea Susan James

Great. Thank you

Investor Relations
 
Huey, we actually have a question emailed in from one of the analysts that 
is out of the country. So I'll read those next. And we'll start with the energy 
storage questions. So, guys, do our years in
 
R&D work in vehicle batteries 
contribute benefits into this Tesla Energy business? Where have we drawn 
some learnings from the vehicle business for Tesla Energy?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I've learnt a lot about battery packs, I
 
mean, obviously, how to make them 
and have them last for a long time and working in high
-
temperature ranges 
and that kind of thing. I think there are a few points of clarification that 
should be made regarding the Powerwall, because a lot of people are 
co
nfused about the whole inverter issue. So, the Powerwall does include a 
DC to DC inverter, and that can interface directly with a solar panel 
installation.
 
And if somebody has a solar panel installation, they already will have a DC 
to AC inverter for the s
olar panel system, and so no incremental DC to AC 
inverter is needed. Like in some of the analysis we've seen online by people 
who think are experts, they don't seem to realize that there is a DC/DC 
inverter, and we haven't been, I guess, quite clear about
 
that, which we 
need to be.
 
But like if you already have a solar installation or you're going to get one, 
the DC/AC inverter is already there. That's an important point in considering 
the cost of the system. And then, the operating temperature 

 
it's actua
lly 
capable of operating at a much wider band of temperature. So we got to fix 
that specification that's stated on the website.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. In general, most of the learning is from the car R&D and engineering 
carry 
over.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
I mean, part of why we can do this so quickly, and...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Anywhere the car works, the pack 
will work...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
...and the car works pretty much everywhere.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Exec
utive Officer
 
So in fact, it does work everywhere. So, the pack will work everywhere 
obviously.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
If anything, it's quite over
-
engineered for a battery pack that doesn't have 
to move, it gets mounted on your wal
l.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
So I think that's going to be a great benefit for reliability and just longevity 
of the pack.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

s
 
Okay. And then, one for Deepak. Would you be willing to provide any 
breakdown of the CapEx spending in Q1?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
The CapEx spending was primarily driven by the capacity expansion that 
we're doing from Model X including th
e tooling spend. And then, of course, 
we are putting in the new paint shop, which is a very significant investment. 
That'll ready in Q3. And then, we've also had investments in the Gigafactory 
and our sales and service network. That's probably the order in
 
which we've 
been spending.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

Vice President

Investor Relations
 
Great. Thank you. Okay, Huey, let's go back to the queue please.
 
Operator
 
Yes, sir. Next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Please go ahead. 
Your line is open.
 
Colin
 
Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Great, thanks for taking my question. I guess, first question staying on the 
stationary storage topic, I mean, how do you view the 

 
you mentioned 
there's two different chemistries. How does that work with the Gigafacto
ry? 
Does that require all separate lines? Is there any more complexities? They 
are all within the same facility? And how do you view your chemistries 
versus other competitive options out there, there are other people who are 
bullish on things like (27:37) 
more basic chemistry?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Well, they could still both be built in the Gigafactory. We have multiple lines 
operating in the Gigafactory so if one line is building nickel
-
cobalt
-
aluminum 
chemistry and another is 
building nickel
-
manganese
-
cobalt, that still works 
just fine. A lot of the cell assembly and then the processes that happen after 
that are almost identical.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I mean, they look the same at the module
 
and pack level. You can't 
really tell just by looking at them.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's just kind of the internal chemical constituents. I mean, if you think like 
the 

 
I mean, sort of right down the palm, like the cell is a chemical 
engineering problem. It's like a little can of chemicals and then the module 
and pack problem is a mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and 
software engineering problem.
 
And if you
 
have a just like a small number of cells, then as an overall 
engineering problem, it's like mostly about the cell. But once you have a lot 
of cells, then the intellectual property challenge, or you know, the 
intellectual challenge becomes more at the mech
anical, electrical and 
software level, which is where Tesla does quite well. That's why you don't 
really see like nobody else is like has a pack like ours. But the cells are 
relatively generic but the module and pack is not.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Tec
hnology Officer
 
Yeah. And we've looked at pretty much every chemistry couple. They could 
possibly be relevant for this and are confident what we're using is going to 
be the best. But if there's something better we can also adjust and change 
over time. So t
here's a lot of flexibility.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure like what the right analogy would be, but like if 
you've got like a laptop, and it's like you could say, well, a laptop is really 
just like Intel C
PU and some Micro and DRAM chips, like big deal. What's any 
computer company actually doing? They're doing a lot.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
So what do you view as your competitive edge? And so it sounds like you 
think it's the software and 
electronic integration, the competitive advantage. 
In your presentation, you actually mentioned you've encouraged other 
companies to enter the market as well.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. And I think in terms of the electrical
 
engineering, the mechanical, the 
software, and the overall aesthetics and just having something that really 
just works and is easy for consumers and utilities and large industrial 
applications to just order, and it just works and it's just there as a full
y 
integrated system, that's what is the value that Tesla is adding.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
I think, there's also substantial benefit to the track record of the automotive 
fleets. That's something that a lot of the sort of newer star
tup companies or 
different technologies in this space really struggle with, especially in the 
utility application where you need to be sure that it's going to work for 15
-
plus years. And we have a sense of scale and a great track record on the 
vehicle flee
t that you can really pull from data and pull data from and 
understand how it's going to work.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. It's not like we're like wedded to a particular chemistry or anything 
like that, we just want to use t
he best chemistry. Like whatever little can 
that contains that cathode and anode and separator and electrolyte, 
whatever the best constituents of that can, that's what we will want to use. 
So we'd love it if somebody could come up with a better internal ch
emistry 
for the cell. But it's worth noting that nobody has sent us anything, a sample 
cell that's better than the cell we're producing, or that something that we 
will produce in the Gigafactory. So, we'd love it if somebody would do that, 
they just haven'
t.
 
So, there's like always things, which are big on promise and short on 
delivery when it comes to battery chemistry, and it's just a real hard 
problem. And then hardly a week goes by that there's not some alleged 
breakthrough in batteries, but what they'l
l do is they'll cite the power, but 
not the energy or they'll forget to mention that it only lasts for 50 cycles or 
uses incredibly exotic raw materials.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Or one component under the battery pulled separately.
 
E
lon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, exactly. It's just not 

 
it's not like a 

 
it's not the full picture. So it's 
not like we don't want a better chemistry to exist than what we're using. 
We'd love it if there was such a thing and I'm
 
sure there will be 
improvements over time and we'll implement them as soon as they are 
remotely production
-
ready.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for the color. Just one last final question, any color on a financial 
question, other expens
es is up quite a bit. It was $22.3 million. What was 
really just driving that in the quarter?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. That was essentially revaluation of primarily our foreign currencies 
that we had at the end of the 
quarter. The dollar was particularly strong 
against foreign currencies there and it's also in most cases unrealized losses. 
So as the currency moves in Q2 in different directions that could have an 
impact as well. A positive effect is what I mean.
 
Colin Mi
chael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. (33:32) most of those one
-
time in nature because of that balance 
sheet effect?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah. They're not related directly to our operations. It's simply the 
devaluation of our currencie
s into company's items.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, sir. Next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with 
Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche 
Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. Couple of questions on stationary storage first. One is it 
seems like utilities moved quite a bit slower than other markets. So I was 
wondering when you are thinking about the expectations for the trajectory of 
growth. 
If you have the capacity today, how long do you think it would take 
for you to get to that 15
-
gigawatt hours?
 
Also, related to this business, it seems like you're using third parties for 
most of the distribution installation. So, if you achieved maybe a 20
% gross 
margin, can you pass along any thoughts on how we should be thinking in 
terms of SG&A is allocated?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I think, it's pretty early days to 

 
I mean, we're being super speculative at 
this point. So, i
t's...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. Maybe one point on the distributors is we're only focusing on that 
approach for Powerwall in most cases. So, with utilities, we're building those 
relationships directly. It's not something that is
 
really effective to go through 
a distribution channel and it's something we've also been doing for a number 
of years. It didn't just start last Thursday.
 
And we've built these relationships partially through vehicle infrastructure 
and charging questions a
nd back and forth, supercharging as well. So, 
there's actually quite a lot of trust built between Tesla and many of the 
utility companies, which is very helpful to grow that business faster.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. And just a cl
arification on the comment about the fact that the DC/AC 
inverter is already there for solar, does the fact that it needs to be 
bidirectional change the nature of the cost or not really?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
No. Not in most cases.
 
Because if you already have solar, typically the 
energy to charge the battery can come from the solar panel. So I think 
maybe one way to think of it is that the battery pack, the Powerwall, with its 
internal DC to DC converter can act much like a solar pa
nel. It can match 
voltage with a solar panel array...
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
I see.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
...and it can feed power back into that. So the existing inverter doesn't 
particularly see a big chang
e.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. Got it. And on the auto business, do you have any preliminary 
expectations on the mix of the 70D versus 85? Any thoughts on how that 
affects margins. And lastly, a question for Deepak, in the past we w
ere able 
to look at your supplemental information on leasing where you disclosed the 
value of the leases delivered and the value that you're booking this at on the 
balance sheet which is presumably your cost. And it sort of approximated 
your gross margins,
 
but this quarter when you do the math, the implied 
margins were something like 44%, not like 29%, 30%. Is there something 
unusual there?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
I'll answer the second one. No, there is nothing unusual in those 
numbers as 
the overall 

 
what you are seeing in the supplemental information is the new 
cars we've delivered. What's coming through ultimately is the cumulative 
impact of all the leasings that we have done. But to my knowledge, there is 
nothing else unusua
l.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. It seems like a pretty high margin though when you look at it that 
way.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We ...
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Anything on the mix, 70
D versus 85?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, it's still pretty early to be predicting mix because you have to 
distinguish between what's sort of initial demand versus sustained demand. 
So, I mean, it looks like there may be goi
ng to be comparable number of 
70s versus 85s. But this is difficult to 

 
I mean this is extrapolating on very 
little information. And yeah, I think a key point I should make before this 
call ends is we're really optimizing at this point going forward. We'r
e going 
to be optimizing for the operational efficiency of the company as opposed to 
specific quarters.
 
I feel like what we've done in the past was really had to scramble at the end 
of quarters and sometimes have not a great customer experience at the end 
of quarters. It's not really the right thing for the company. And so we're 
going to be operating more for sort of steady state efficiency and that means 
the quarterly fluctuations could be a little higher, but in the long term, it will 
be better. So that's
 
an important consideration.
 
Also sort of unlike other car companies, Tesla sales are only recognized 
when they arrive at the end customer, and we've received payment and all 
the regulatory docs have been processed and all that. So, our sales are 
always ki
nd of 

 
they're always true sales. They're not sales to the channel, 
whereas the other car companies are their sale is to the channels, so it's 
possible for them to make numbers work where they're selling to their 
channel as opposed to end customers. In ou
r case, it's always end 
customers.
 
And as we're shipping to Asia and Europe and across the U.S., it's fairly easy 
for there to be a plus, minus 5% difference in deliveries just due to logistics 
issues. So it's not a huge variation, plus/minus 5%. But that'
s kind of like 
the 

 
if a ship is late or early, it can affect the 

 
(40:27) cars that are 
affected, and then that's 5%, which we've seen in the past.
 
So that's an important thing to bear in mind. The number that's much more 
controllable for us is the prod
uction number. So that our production 
predictions, I think, for the vehicles are, at least for the Model S, not so 
much for new vehicle, but for existing vehicle, our production predictions are 
a lot more controllable.
 
And then as I think people at this po
int realize the demand is different from 
production, like our cars are almost all ordered in advance. So we really 
don't see any demand issue, but you can sort of see that by the delivery 
times of the cars on our website.
 
So it's like some of you will inte
rpret a quarterly delivery number as 
somehow being related to demand. This is not the case. This is usually 
related to like just 

 
that's how many 

 
we produce a certain number and 
then we're able to deliver a certain number in the quarter and there's a 
wh
ole bunch of cars on ships or on trains or on trucks, but because Tesla is 
different from other car companies, applying the other car companies' 
template can lead to incorrect conclusions about Tesla. Is this making sense, 
I mean, or should I elaborate fur
ther here?
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Yeah. Makes sense.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Okay.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah. And to add to what Elon said, to be more efficient operationally, we 
are shi
pping more by train rather than trucks as it's more cost
-
efficient and 
creates less damage to the car. It gives a better customer experience. So...
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Right.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
...we are taking
 
more traction. (42:32)
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
I guess my question is more geared to trying to assess the effect on ASPs 
and margins as you're changing the mix a little bit, but I appreciate that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & 
Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. To sort of answer your question on margins, I think, there's two things 
that they're having like the average sales price is going to decline a little bit, 
but our costs are improving as well. So I mean we see that more or less
 
netting out. So the efficiency improvements offset approximately any 
average selling prices change.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Got it.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
And this is the process we are growing the market which we tru
ly are by 
hitting the right sweet spot and we're doing the right thing with the 70D.
 
And the 70D has a higher gross margin than the 60 for example and 60 was 
just not hitting the market, just didn't have the right attributes that our 
customers like, it was
 
a low take rate and we've got a product which is far 
more compelling and much more competitive with other cars.
 
Rod A. Lache

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from the line of 
Colin 
Rusch with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your questions, 
please.
 
Colin W. Rusch 
-
 
Northland Capital Markets
 
Thanks so much, guys. As you look at the growth of the organization, the 
entirety of the culture and the work force, I know that
 
your employees are 
extremely motivated. But can you talk about, as you grow, how that's 
growing and changing and what you're doing to maintain that integrity as we 
go forward?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I mean, it is tricky
 
as companies grow to maintain a consistent culture. 
I think we're doing okay. I think it's measured relative to most companies. 
But we do need to get you all to think differently and have an expectation of 
innovation. I mean, I think we're doing okay on t
hat front.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. I think having a general mix of people that have been here for a very 
long time and have seen multiple programs and seen the company when it 
was even much smaller than today and more scrappy a
nd had to go through 
even tighter financial difficult launches, things like that, really helps maintain 
that culture. And we try and pair different managers up with new groups so 
that that culture sort of infuses throughout.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Ch
ief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. And our growth rate, like this year, personnel
-
wise, is sort of, I'd say, 
leveled off. It's still fairly significant, but it's like our net personnel growth 
this year will probably be 20% to 30%, which is, I think, a manageable 
number for kind of integrating with people that already have kind of the 
Tesla culture. And I think it's also 

 
it's a pretty big improvement in 
productivity because we're looking at 

 
let's call it like at the upper end of 
that 30% personnel increase, but
 
a 100% increase in vehicle volume. So, I 
think that's a pretty good indicator for activity improvements, just like how 
many people do we have and how many cars are we making.
 
Colin W. Rusch 
-
 
Northland Capital Markets
 
Great. And then the second question i
s really around some of the choices 
that you made with the battery product and why choosing 10kW and the 
size, 220 pounds is actually pretty hefty for a garage wall. And then also the 
Battery Management System. I think there's a lot of confusion around whe
re 
it's located and what the real functionality is as you look out at interfacing 
with utilities and the signals that you get from the market in terms of 
looking at demand, trying to offset, demand response and some of the other 
advanced functionalities th
at are going to be able to be monetizing business 
models with the product. Can you just clarify where that BMS system is 
really residing and who owns that technology and why you guys made those 
choices along with the weight and size choices?
 
Jeffrey B. Str
aubel

Chief Technology Officer
 
Well, some of the different revenue streams you're talking about are kind of 
mixed between Powerpack and Powerwall. The BMS system lives inside the 
battery pack in both cases, but with the Powerpack and the more utility
-
siz
ed installations, there, we often will have sort of a site master computer 
or master controller that controls multiple Powerpacks and that site 
controller is what then interfaces to the utility or maybe a commercial 
customer to sort of run the scheduled ch
arge and discharge that would be 
appropriate for a given application.
 
On the Powerwall, it's a bit of a different situation. Still the BMS lives inside 
the battery pack, but in some cases, the inverter may be the system that's 
deciding how to manage energy
 
in the overall house. And that can depend 
on which type of inverter we're using and how that works. And in terms of 
the size, we really 

 
for Powerwall, again, we optimized the size around what 
was the most common photovoltaic size and also what we felt w
as kind of 
the smallest modular increment for backup. And it's pretty key to note here 
that you can install multiple Powerwalls together.
 
So, having 10 kilowatt hours doesn't mean that you can't very easily put in 
20 kilowatt hours or 30 kilowatt hours or 
40 kilowatt hours, and in many 
cases, I think people will, to have the backup kind of matching that they 
want to see. But we felt 10 kilowatt hours was the lowest kind of common 
elements. And if you go smaller than that, you start to run into worst 
economi
es of scale and more of the system that's not related to storage.

Huey, before we go to 
the next question, I just want to give everybody a 
status update here. A lot of important things to talk about on this call. But 
we're 50 minutes into the call and we still have seven callers in queue. So 
just let you guys think about how we manage time he
re. Okay. Huey, let's 
go to the next question, please.

Yes, sir. Our next phone question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead. Your questions, please.

Evening, everybody. Firs
t question on the Model S and the release 
candidates, how many release candidates have you produced? What have 
been some of the issues with the recent production and why the slight 

 
am 
I seeing a slight further delay biasing late 3Q from what I thought wa
s kind 
of more of an August time horizon for initial deliveries, anything that kind of 
might be behind that that you would highlight?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I think we'll pass on sort of answering super
-
detailed questions abou
t the X 
ramp. But the thing that really matters is not like when do the first deliveries 
of the X occur, but rather when do significant deliveries of the X occur. And 
for the S, we had quite a long ramp from 

 
we're like six months from the 
very first deli
veries to a significant volume. We're trying to compress that to 
maybe like two months or three months at most. I'll cut that in half or more 
for the X. And we want to make sure we're really delivering a product that 
has been thoroughly validated in hot an
d cold weather and through millions 
of miles of travel and everything.
 
So it would be easy for us to kind of do some initial deliveries in August. 
That would be pretty easy. But then, like, we don't have like 

 
we have had 
door handle issues, like people a
re aware of that with the S. They don't want 
to have buckling door issues with the X. We want to iron everything out and 
make sure it's good and then deliver at high volume.
 
So effectively, it would create a captive fleet and iron out the issues with 
that 
captive fleet. It's 

 
they're quite big, several hundred vehicles basically, 
and maybe that addresses your release candidate question. And just to 
make sure that those several hundred vehicles really work well in all 
circumstances before we start deliverin
g cars en masse because we're going 
to go from a small number of cars to like 1,000 a week pretty fast.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. And just a second quarter in the interest of time and then a final 
question. Apple has kind of still
 
unofficially perhaps making 

 
they're making 
inroads into building up its vehicle engineering and transportation 
capabilities according to a lot of sources and making investments both in 
physical capital and human capital. Are you starting to feel a great
er sense 
of competition with Silicon Valley parties versus your ability to attract and 
retain key software and automotive engineering talent? And if Apple were to 
get into the electric car business, would you see this as a positive for 
broader consumer acc
eptance of electric vehicles?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I certainly hope Apple gets into the car business. That would be great. But 
no, we're not really seeing significant attrition of engineers to Apple, for 
anything, car or oth
erwise. And actually, anyone can like figure this out by 
just going on LinkedIn. LinkedIn can produce statistics on what the relative 
flow of people is from one company to another. And I think it's like 

 
something like 

 
if you look at like the trailing 1
2 months, Tesla has 
recruited five times as many people from Apple as Apple's recruited from 
Tesla. It's like some 

 
it's a fairly high number.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

All right.
 
Operator
 
Our next phone question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please 
go ahead.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yeah. Just really want to ask about the balance between stationary and 
automotive. It's not unusual fo
r growth companies to change their focus as 
they evolve. I think at least one of the stories around PayPal that it was 
going to be a cryptographic PDA
-
focused company until it refocused perhaps 
through your help, Elon, on Web
-
based payments.
 
I'm hearing yo
u talk about stationary storage as being able to ramp faster, 
perhaps, although you didn't answer this kind of maybe with a lower CapEx 
and OpEx ratio than the auto business. Yet at the same time, auto takes a 
lot of capital, takes a lot of OpEx. And Sergi
o Marchionne pointed out there's 
a lot of value
-
destroying capital spent in the legacy industry. Is it 
conceivable that instead of, say, being fixed 70/30 auto batteries, that could 
go the other way?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It'
s possible. I mean, this is 

 
we're like really super in guesswork territory 
here. All we know right now is like we have demand like well in excess of our 
production ramp. So, we know like right now, the thing we should work on is 
trying to increase our pr
oduction ramp, not trying to increase demand.
 
So that's kind of like the only thing we know for sure right now. And then if 
you look really long
-
term say what's the total energy 

 
how many battery 

 
what's the total terawatt hours of factory installation t
hat's needed to go to a 
fully renewable global economy, taking into account transportation, current 
electrical needs, so assume full electrification of transport, electrification of 
all heating and cooling and then the current industrial uses and commercia
l 
uses of electricity. Like, basically, to go fully electric, the transport is about 
half the size of everything else, but that was sort of our sort of global macro 
calculations.
 
So ultimately, we think things will get there. It could take a long time, but
 
that's kind of where we think things will end up and 

 
yeah, but before we 
get to like the kind of 2 billion Powerpack number, whether that's made by 
Tesla or other companies or some combination, that's kind of the number 
you need to get to go fully elect
ric. But where things 

 
how things track 
between now and then, it's difficult to predict.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
And in terms of the ROIC, would you be thinking that stationary could be a 
better ROIC business in auto than say mass ma
rket or mass affluent 
automotive?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It might. I mean, it'd be nice to get like maybe a couple of quarters of 
experience after making the big announcement to really 

 
before we 

 
like 
our degree of 
uncertainly will diminish quite substantially with each passing 
month. Certainly, a year from now, we have (56:45) like a really, I think, a 
really good idea of it. It's like super speculative at this point. But we just 
don't 

 
like, man, there's just no w
ay we can meet the demand that we're 
seeing right now. And so, we got to scale stationary storage as fast as 
possible.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
And you mentioned last time that some CapEx was going to product 
development in the shareho
lders' letter for Model 3, if Model 3 wasn't in this. 
Does that mean you might be delaying some Model 3 investments or just the 
other things kind of swamp it?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's just the other things kind of swamp it,
 
but we need to make sure 

 
like 
we're doing quite a bit of advance work on Model 3, but this just doesn't 
amount to a lot of CapEx.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
And just to clarify, Model 3 spending in initial stages is more engineering 
spend...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's like basically design the studio.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Exactly.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's like very early engineering prototypes.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Ch
ief Financial Officer
 
Correct.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's just not very 

 
it's just not very cash
-
intensive.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah. CapEx comes at a later stage when you have all the designs finalized, 
y
ou're kicking off tooling. And...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
So we are in the early stages, as to be expected at this point in time.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Well, Brian, you might want to ask the follow
-
up, does this impact our Model 
3 timings? So, I'll throw that.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Well, go ahead.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, we are hoping to show off the Model 3 in approximately March of 
next year. Again like, don't hold me to that month, but that's like 

 
that's 
our aspiration.
 
And that's 

 
and then be in production with Model 3 in the, 
I'd like to say mid, but probably closer to late 2017 timeframe. Late 2017 is 
probably more realistic.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. And in the meantime, the Gigafactory sou
nds like it's maybe ramping 
up faster, but perhaps those batteries could go not just to Fremont cars, but 
to Fremont stationary storage, or to stationary storage, not necessarily 
touching Fremont.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. It would just be built actually just right there 

 
not even go to 
Fremont, really it would just be built at the Reno factory, (59:12) factory 
and go from 

 
ship from there to customers.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. Starting Q1
 
next year, that's our plan for all the stationary or all the 
Tesla Energy products.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson

Okay. Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. 
Please go ahead. Your line is n

Ryan J. Brinkman

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I have a two
-
part question on cash. Firstly, 
on the last call, you mentioned reaching free cash flow positive in 4Q of this 
year. I'm just wondering with 1Q behind you, how
 
you think you're tracking 
relative to that goal? And then, secondly, if you could perhaps comment on 
your capitalization and liquidity overall and the potential for 

 
or desirability 
of raising any additional capital? Thanks.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financia
l Officer
 
We do expect to be free cash flow positive in Q4. That doesn't change. And 
as we go along, clearly, we are optimizing for efficiency, which results in 
increase of our finished goods inventory. That makes sense for us to then 
establish some asset 
pipelines or credit which is backed by our finished 
goods inventory or raw materials. So we'll take those actions to make sure 
we have a solid balance sheet.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. Things are looking pretty good for Q4. I
 
think it's hard to predict full 
quarter exactly because that whole quarterly boundary and where does the 
exponential ramp of production fall exactly on that side of Q4 boundary. But 
I think it's extremely likely that cash flow is really good at the end of
 
Q4.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman

Thank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from the line of Trip 
Chowdhry with Global Equities Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Trip S. Chowdhry 
-
 
Global Equities Research LLC
 
Thank you. A quick question, two qu
ick questions. First is regarding the 
residences which may not have the solar panels, and say that residence 
goes and buys two Powerwalls. Does that customer have to buy two 
inverters or one inverter is sufficient for as many Powerwalls the customer 
buys?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. It's basically whatever the capability of that inverter is. So, typically, a 
inverter would be capable of handling 

 
one inverter is probably capable of 
handling, depending on the situation, up to m
aybe four or five Powerwalls.
 
Trip S. Chowdhry 
-
 
Global Equities Research LLC
 
The second question I had was regarding the Double Black tour you had in 
10 cities, and our research indicated that was a very successful event with 
the reservations and orders r
eally skyrocketing. And I think it was only in 
Canada and USA. Wondering if you could expand that tour to other 
continents?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes, absolutely. We just did a big thing in Europe through Germany, and I 
think
 
there's, like, quite a big tour happening from Slovenia, I think, through 
most of Europe. So there's actually quite a lot happening. Actually, our sales 
in Europe lately have been pretty great. I mean, like, yes, really strong.
 
Deepak Ahuja

in Europe, sorry...

If I can ask one last question, I was at your Lathrop factory the other day 
and there was some interesting construction happening beh
ind it with huge 
metallic frames being installed. What kind of production could be happening 
there? And it seems like the factory size has increased by almost 40%, and 
what is happening there? Any thoughts you can share with us? And that's all 
for me.
 
Elon
 
Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. We're establishing a big casting foundry and machining facility there 
and that's intended to support activity in Fremont. So yes, that's what's 
happening in Lathrop primarily.
 
Operator
 
Okay. Our next ph
one question will come from the line of Patrick 
Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in and I'll be quick. Just wanted to 
build on I think 
Ryan Brinkman's question on the fourth quarter cash flow 
guidance. Does that include income from those warehouse facilities to offset 
leased vehicles or is that exclusive of that?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
In our projection, as Elon said, towa
rds the end of the quarter as we ramp 
up production, we should be free cash flow positive on a pure sense.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
But frankly, our operations should be looked at without the
 
impact of leasing 
and that's a purer measure of operations which is a lower threshold, I get it. 
But that's a unique or a distinct decision we've made to be in that business.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Yes, I know, it still helps the mod
el.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson 
-
 
Vice President
-
Investor Relations
 
Deepak, do you want to explain about 
-
hold on a second, Pat. Deepak, do 
you want to explain about the classification of cash inflows within the 
statement of cash flows.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financi
al Officer
 
Yes. So if you look at our Q1 cash flows, for example, we received $155 
million from our either the warehouse line or our banking partners related to 
our leasing business. But that cash flow does not show up as an offset in our 
cash flow from op
erations. It shows up in our financing activities. So, our 
cash flow from operation shows up $131 million negative. But if you offset 
that against the $155 million that we received on the leasing business, we 
were slightly better than breakeven purely on a
n operations basis. And so, 
our real cash burn in Q1 was driven by the strong CapEx spend ahead of the 
Model X launch is the way we tend to look at the business internally.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay, and I appreciate the clarificati
on. The other quick question I had is 
just I was a little surprised by the 

 
I think you guys had obviously very 
good gross margins this quarter relative to some of the headwinds that you 
were facing and I guess I was surprised to see that ex
-
ZEV they go f
rom 
26% to 25%. With some of the increases in pricing that you're putting 
through and some of the components that you're buying outside of the U.S. 
with a stronger dollar now where there was a little bit of a lag I understand, 
that seemed a bit conservativ
e and I don't know, maybe it ties back into 
Rod's earlier point about mix. But I guess that was one area that I was a 
little surprised.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes. No. So just to clarify, the price increase that we've announced is not 
going
 
to help us in Q2. Given our book of business, it's going to primarily 
affect us in Q3.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
And also in April, for most of April, the dollar was pretty strong. It's just
 
strengthened in the last week or 10 days or so, and we were continuing to 
deliver cars. So that strong dollar impact does roll over sequentially into Q2 
for us despite the lag effect of good news from a strong dollar. And as we 
said in the letter, we full
y expect the mix impact to be offset by cost 
reductions that we will achieve. So it's really related to FX that we see the 
sequential drop.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. The FX was really 

 
that was a really tricky thing to deal
 
with, because 
we had a quite strong European sales and then...
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
...the FX impact was quite significant. So, say, you've got a car that is, like, 
let's sa
y, 25% gross margin, you see a 20% change in currency, it's like, 
wow, okay. That's not super easy to make up that difference.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes. And to your point, and maybe this is a broader comment to make that 
as we look at 
our Q1 non
-
GAAP loss that we have of $45 million, a big chunk 
or most of it could be attributed to the dollar strength that has happened 
over the last six months. As we've indicated, our Q1 top line came down by 
about three percentage points and then we ha
d the $22 million unrealized 
losses from currency. You combine those two and there's an offset in gross 
margin due to lower cost of parts we buy in foreign currencies. But if you 
consider this whole mix and you can see the foreign currency change, over 
the
 
last six months, can explain most of the losses we had in Q1.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
And, yes, maybe just like that last piece is interesting. I mean, how much 
are you able to take advantage of that natural hedge you just 
described, 
right? Because you are buying components in currencies that have also 
depreciated, right? Batteries are one obvious thing. I'm sure you're sourcing 
a lot of stuff in Mexico. Are you close to optimizing that or is that something 
that can be exerc
ised more?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
For better or worse and one can look at this as a pro or con depending on 
the situation, basically about 60% of the car, maybe a little more than 60% 
is U.S. and Canada. So we certainly have l
ike lots of, say, European 
companies that supply us, but they will supply us from plants in the U.S. or 
Canada or sometimes Mexico. So this really is a North American built car, 
not 

 
for real (1:09:39). So it's like, as Deepak was saying, it's slightly 
he
lpful if the dollar strengthens relative to the yen, but then since we have 
like quite strong European sales, this is 

 
but I can't think, 5% of our 
products or something come from Europe. It's pretty low.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Right.
 
Elon
 
Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So, if our sales are 30% in Europe, then obviously it's not as much of offset 
as we'd like. I actually thought it would be higher than that, but it's like 

 
because I'm looking at the names of the suppliers.
 
But what matters is 
where 

 
not the name of supplier. If their headquarters in Germany, but 
where is the plant. So...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes.
 
Patrick K. Archambault

Got you. Okay. Well, thank you for the helpful c
olor there.

Our next question will come from the line of Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest 
Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Brad Erickson 
-
 
Pacific Crest Securities
 
Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow
-
up from the last one 
on the 
automotive gross margins. I guess ex currency, can you just quickly 
talk maybe a couple examples where you're looking to remove more cost 
from the car itself? I think we can all appreciate there's continued scale 
advantages over time. But maybe if you coul
d talk about other cost
-
savings 
opportunities we should be thinking about with both the S and the X and 
sort of what inning we're in terms of achieving those savings? Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. A big factor is labo
r hours per vehicle. That has steadily improved. It 
was sort of quite bad in Q4, particularly with P85D ramp. We've made good 
progress on that in Q1 and we'll continue to make good progress on that 
through the rest of the year. So it's labor and direct ove
rhead in the factory.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes. We're focused across every line item of our cost, so material cost 
reductions, freight both inbound, we spoke a little bit about outbound freight 
efficiencies but...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairm
an & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. We had a lot of expediting.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
You know that big port strike was super unhelpful. That also hurt pretty 
badly. It was like 
the I think the worst port strike in the 21st century. And so 
we're also soldiering through that. So we had to airfreight a ton of stuff...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Exactly right.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
...while 
everyone else is simultaneously trying to airfreight a bunch of stuff. 
That's like...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
It cost us several million dollars because of the port strike.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Just to airfrei
ght, yes. So, cutting back on airfreight is really helpful, yeah 
it's direct (1:12:27) labor hours, just...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
We continue with several engineering and commercial actions on material 
costs. So it's a long list, not appro
priate to go through, but yes, as a 
company we are focused on Model X, but S is also certainly improving gross 
margin. That is part of our priorities.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-

This is Ben. Hey, guys, just 
very quickly, you mentioned the Gigafactory and 
then a lot of talk about stationary storage and increasing sites for 
Gigafactory. Does that change in any way that you're looking at 
partnerships, bringing partnerships in and maybe an update on timing there?
 
And then Elon, you talked about having a fleet of 200 X to get out and test, 
and you mentioned Model 3 to show in next March. When should we see the 
Model X and its final version? Thanks, guys.

Well, no particular ch
ange to the partnership model for the Gigafactory. I 
think, as Elon said, it's early days on trying to make some of those changes 
in direction, but largely it's just a bigger scope of opportunity for a lot of the 
people we're already working with, and it i
s continuing to go well. We're 
actually beginning to hire operational people at the Gigafactory and 
beginning to staff up on that ahead of starting to train, and then ramp up 
production of the stationary products early next year.

Elon, do you want to talk about 
Model X? We've had a number of questions 
from investors and Ben's question here about when you'll be able to 
configure Model X online, when we'll show that to the public, how that will 
actually deploy?

Y
es. Probably three months from now, (1:14:44) May, so it's like 

 
this is 
early July is when we'll ask people to do the configuration. And it would be 
very similar to the S, like it's not going to be super 

 
there's no big surprises 
there. It's very simila
r to the S. And, yes, and we certainly have a lot of 
customers who've been waiting a long time. So they will probably (1:15:13).

Yes. I think (1:15:19), this is really a great car. I mean it's like 

 
because I 
have like such a low center of mass, I mean it handles like a sports car even 
though it's an SUV. The battery pack is in the floor pan. And it's got an 
incredible acc
eleration because it's like basically performance version of it 
like there is for the P85D. The performance is just surreal. It's like nothing 
else is comparable.

2/8/18,Tesla,"Thank you. So last quarter we delivered more than 95,000 vehicles, which is 
a record for Tesla. To put that in perspective, it's nearly an 80% increase in 
deliveries compared to the second quarter of last year. I mean it's 
sometimes hard for people to 
appreciate when you have a large 
manufactured item with a complex double supply chain, just how difficult 
that is. I'm incredibly proud of the Tesla team for being able to do that.
 
I think this level of growth is possibly unprecedented, might be the fastes
t 
that any large complex manufactured item has grown in history. So just, I 
think, really great work by the Tesla team to achieve that outcome, and we 
expect growth to continue in the future at 
--
 
for several years to come at 
50% to 100% level.
 
So 

 

ike generally that's not well appreciated how the quarters [ph] to 
grow at that rate. So 
--
 
achieving record number of deliveries is an 
important milestone and it shows the rapid progress we've made in 
managing our global logistics and delivery operations 
at high volume. And as 
I said, all this was achieved, thanks to the tremendous hard work of the 
entire Tesla team.
 
Model 3 was once again the best
-
selling premium vehicle in the U.S., 
outselling all of its gas
-
powered equivalents combined. In Europe, Model
 
3 is 
approaching sales levels of its established premium competitors, and it was 
awarded a five
-
star rating from Euro NCAP earlier this month. This is in 
addition to Model 3 receiving an overall five
-
star rating in the U.S. from 
NHTSA and including earnin
g five stars in every category and subcategory 
and achieving the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested.
 
Motor Trend also recently selected Model S as the best vehicle they have 
ever tested in their 70
-
year history across all other cars. S
o, Motor Trend, 
which is arguably the leading authority in evaluating vehicles, the Motor 
Trend Car of the Year is the most coveted award. It's pretty incredible that 
they would say that Model S in their entire 70
-
year history is the best 
vehicle they have
 
ever evaluated. This is despite Tesla not buying any 
advertising in Motor Trend, and I think it speaks to their journalistic 
integrity. That's something special. So 
--
 
and since the vehicle that they 
evaluated, we've actually made 
--
 
commenced advancement
s of both Model 
S and Model X including our recent update of a new suspension with active 
damping capability, and an all
-
new drivetrain that's capable of 370
-
mile 
range in the Model S and 325
-
mile range in the Model X.
 

pdates and improvements that have 
made Model S and Model X faster, safer, and added dozens of new features. 
Just like Model 3, Model S and X have the hardware needed for future full 
self
-
driving capability.
 
As we look ahead to the rest of the year and into
 
2020, we remain focused 
on launching new vehicle and energy programs further expanding our 
manufacturing operations and continuing to improve customer service.
 
We remain focused on international expansion because local production is 
essential to being cos
t competitive. By the end of this year, we will 
--
 
we 
expect to be producing Model 3s in volume out of Gigafactory Shanghai. And 
as you can see it from the photos in our quarterly letter, the equipment 
installation there is progressing well. We also have t
o finalize a location for 
our European Gigafactory before the end of the year.
 
Here at Fremont, preparations for Model Y production has already begun. 
Since Model Y has high component overlap with Model 3, it should be 
--
 
we 
expect it to be a lot easier to
 
ramp. It's something on the order of three 
quarters of all the parts are common between Model 3 and Model Y. And we 
expect the manufacturing costs for Model Y despite additional content to be 
approximately the same as Model 3.
 
This quarter, we opened 25 n
ew service locations and added more than 100 
mobile service vehicles to our fleet. And although our fleets have a total 
--
 
Tesla fleet size has doubled in the past 12 months, which is like again, just 
kind of a crazy thing to consider that Tesla is almost 
doubling all cumulative 
production every year. This is a totally mad thing to make as many cars in 
the year as we've made in our entire history, and to have that be an ongoing 
trend, I think it's difficult for people to really feel an exponential. So, we 
d

understand an exponential at a cognitive level. But Tesla is expanding at an 
exponential rate.
 
And in fact, if you look at the Tesla cumulative deliveries chart like year
-
over
-
year 
cumulative deliveries, it's about the cleanest exponential graph I 
have ever seen. So, obviously, if that trend continues, results I think are 
going to be pretty amazing and I think that will continue.
 
So, we've been able to improve service considerably an
d you can imagine 
that if 
--
 
obviously, if we're doubling our fleet every year, managing service 
is quite difficult. It's like a total 
--
 
because service scales as 
--
 
not just with 
new production but as the total fleet scales, service needs to scale. And 
w
e're going to scale service in a way that's sensible from a cost standpoint, 
a bit better that kind of it is really quite a difficult challenge to scale.
 
Nonetheless, we've made massive improvements in service, especially in 
parts waiting 
--
 
time to wait f
or parts and in collision repair, and we've in
-
sourced a great deal of the collision repair activities which has had, I think, 
quite a good effect on customer happiness. And this will continue in the 
months to come.
 

 
I think we believe Tesla has 

 
is now 
at the point of being self
-
funding, and we expect to be cash flow 
--
 
free cash 
flow positive in future quarters with the possible temporary exceptions 
around the launch and ramp of new product. From a profitability st
andpoint, 
we expect to be probably around breakeven this quarter and profitable next 
quarter, so that's 
--
 
I feel pretty confident about that.
 
And then in terms of deliveries, we expect deliveries to be between 360,000 
and 400,000. We expect production to 
be a slightly higher number than that, 
and demand to be a slightly higher number than that. So, people often 
confuse deliveries, production, and orders for Tesla, and they're actually 
three different numbers.
 
So yes, you obviously cannot deliver more than 
you make, and so typically 
we will make more than we deliver. And then the demand generation 
activities kind of move in kind of like 
--
 
to get together with production like it 
doesn't make sense to put a lot of effort into demand generation if 
production c
an't meet the demand and likewise.
 
So, what just happened is, we'll solve the production issues, and then the 
say okay, we need to increase demand, address demand, and then it may 
increase production, then increase demand. I 
--
 

caug
ht up in the details a lot, but if you look at the actual results, like I said 
look at cumulative deliveries over time for Tesla, cleanest exponential you've 
ever seen, extrapolate that curve [ph]. So, there's a trend [ph] lot to be 
excited about at Tesla,
 
and we'll have more to share in the coming weeks 
and months.
 
Zach is there anything you'd like to say about our results?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes sure. Thanks Elon. A few things I want to highlight before moving into 
the Q&A. Overall, Q2 was a strong 
quarter for Tesla. I'm extremely proud of 
the team for the progress we've made. We've achieved record vehicle 
production and delivery, record storage production and deployment, record 
services and other revenue with a corresponding reduced loss.
 
As we've m
entioned a few times, we stabilized international logistics and 
delivery operations at higher volumes, and we saw gross margin 
improvement in nearly every aspect of the business adjusting for the impact 
of regulatory credit revenue.
 
As a result of these ac
complishments, we once again achieved strong free 
cash flows which is only partially attributed to working capital benefits. We 
also successfully raised roughly $2.4 billion in net proceeds in May. Thus, we 
exited the quarter with $5 billion in cash and ca
sh equivalents, the highest in 
our history.
 
Our net loss reduced significantly relative to Q1 aided by higher volumes and 
progress on cost efficiencies. A few things to note. There's $117 million 
within operating expenses for restructuring. We had a sequen
tial reduction 
of $104 million related to regulatory credit, which is inherently lumpy. And in 
our other income line, we saw a $66 million reduction. This is nearly entirely 
due to foreign exchange, which we don't hedge.
 
GAAP automotive gross margin only r
educed slightly, despite the reduction 
in credit revenue and expected reductions in our vehicle average selling 
prices. Adjusting for the impact of credits, automotive gross margin 
improved materially. For Model S and Model X, ASPs were impacted by 
pricing
 
actions applied to inventory of vehicles built prior to the launch of our 
powertrain and suspension upgrades in April, the majority of which were 
sold and delivered in Q2.
 
For Model 3, global ASPs stabilized during the quarter at roughly $50,000, a 
sequen
tial reduction, yet gross profit per Model 3 improved representing the 
continued success of our cost management efforts.
 
Note that we continue to defer a significant portion of revenue associated 
with full self
-
driving, which will be recognized in future p
eriods upon the 
release of additional features.
 
Operating expenses, net of restructuring continues to improve as well 
despite the increases in volume, reflecting the immense focus on improving 
our operating efficiency. And while operating expenses and capi
tal expenses 
may appear to be unnaturally low this quarter, that's not the case. Rather 
these reflect continued progress on cost efficiency and ability to scale our 
core technologies and processes.
 
If we take a step back here, I think it's important to rem
ember that Tesla is 
on a long
-
term journey and it's difficult to see the full picture looking 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter. We committed that Model 3 would be a transformative 
product both for the industry and our business.
 
Three years ago, we unveiled the Model 3. Two years ago, we brought the 
product to market. One year ago, we demonstrated our ability to build the 
Model 3 at high rate. So far this year, we've demonstrated our ability to 
manage global deliveries and logisti
cs at a higher rate, but the most 
important thing is that we've demonstrated our ability to generate significant 
organic demand as nearly all orders generated in Q2 were non
-
reservation 
holders.
 
And thus far in Q3, our order pacing is ahead of where we wer
e at this point 
in Q2. And as we noted in our Q2 production and delivery release, our order 
backlog increased over the course of Q2.
 
Ultimately, the Model 3 is accomplishing what our business needs it to do. It 
expanded our sales and customer base, enablin
g us to generate cash we 
need to reinvest. In the process, we've appropriately managed our operating 
expenses and have reduced the cost of running the business. This is critically 
important because I feel as though we've broken through a baseline fixed 
cos
t barrier, enabled by the success of the Model 3 business.
 
With continued focus on execution and cost management, the next 12 to 18 
months should be the most exciting yet. During this time, we believe that 
Gigafactory, Shanghai will be producing at scale. 
Model Y will be in 
production, addressing the most popular vehicle segment.
 
Our European Gigafactory will be well underway. Our autonomous driving 
feature suite will continue to develop; energy products business will grow 
and maybe a few other things along
 
the way.
 
And while there's inherent risk in any large and ambitious set of projects, 
our intent is to grow and invest as fast as we can afford to. With the cash we 
have on hand and the stabilization of Model 3 across the key areas as I've 
noted, we believ
e we're in great shape for this next phase of growth.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. Now let's start taking some first questions. Sorry 
about that. Sorry. Go ahead.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Okay. So, an important update is that JB Straubel, our Co
-
founder and 
Ch
ief Technology Officer will be transitioning to a Senior Advisor from the 
CTO role; and Drew Baglino will be taking over most of JB's responsibilities. 
I'd like to thank JB for his fundamental role in creating and building Tesla. 
Thank you, JB.
 
JB Straubel
 
Thanks, Elon.
 
Elon Musk
 
If we hadn't had lunch in 2003, Tesla wouldn't exist basically.
 
JB Straubel
 
It's been 

 
yeah, it's been quite an adventure, 16 years.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. But lunch with you and Harold Rosen [indiscernible]. That's the reason 
Tesla exis
ts.
 
JB Straubel
 
I remember it well. And maybe just to add a bit more to that, I'm not 
disappearing, and I just want to make sure that people understand that this 
is not some lack of confidence in the company or the team or anything like 
that. I love the te
am. I love the company and I always will. So, Drew and I 
have worked closely together for many, many years, and I have total 
confidence in Drew, and I'm not going anywhere if there's anything I need to 
do to be helpful to Drew or the whole team or any of t
he ongoing projects. 
Yeah, I mean, I'm actually really happy with how we've kind of phased and 
transitioned some of these different projects and people in, and I feel like 
this is a super good process overall. Drew, you want to say anything.
 
Drew Baglino
 
O
bviously, big shoes to fill JB, but we have been working closely. In fact, 
we've already been talking about this project back in 2003 all along and 

 
Elon Musk
 
You guys talked back in 2003 as well?
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, 2003 was a good year.
 
Drew Baglino
 
I was graduating and I didn't know what to do.
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay.
 
Drew Baglino
 
I was like, let's do this project. But I 

 
I feel exactly as you feel that we are 
well set up that we know how to get help where we need to from you, and 
that we're ve
ry excited about the growth ahead of us, about myself and the 
whole team.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
JB Straubel
 
And I'm excited to stay involved in some of our core technologies, and all 
that help where I can. Just in less of an operational, obviously less 

 
not an 
executive type role.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sounds good. Well, JB, thanks again for your integral role in creating this 
company and Drew as well. So that's cool you guys were talking about it in 
2003, it sounds like the right year.
 
JB Straubel
 
Good year.
 
Elon Musk
 
Good
 
year.
 
Drew Baglino
 
It was 

 
the technology was ready.
 
Elon Musk
 


 
JB Straubel
 
Yeah. They did some pioneering wor
k.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. So, can we have some questions now?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
A 
-
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. So, we have some first questions from our retail 
shareholders from say.com. And the first question is, it has been stated that 
Tesla i
s supply constrained, not demand constrained. Can you help us shed 
some light on why Tesla is lowering car cost if supply is constrained?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. There's a number of things to consider here. The 
--
 
there's really two 
key dimensions for 
demand. There's value for money and then there's 
affordability. Obviously, if somebody simply does not have enough money to 
buy the car, it doesn't matter how much the value 
--
 
how good the value for 
money is. You can have infinite value for money if someb
ody does not have 
the funds to buy the car, they simply can't get it.
 
So, this is just very important to parse those two. And I think there's like 

 
there's tremendous amount of desire to buy our cars, but people obviously 

uy them, they cannot. So, we have to 
make the cars more affordable. Actually, like in the U.S., our cars got almost 
$2,000 more expensive with the expiry of the tax credit on July 1 or partial 
expiry.
 
And we only dropped the price of the Standard Range Plu
s Model 3 by 
$1,000 or actually 
--
 
yes, by $1,000. So, the base Model 3 actually got a 
$1,000 more expensive, which seemed like a reasonable compromise. So 
that's actually 
--
 
we feel sometimes just having this sort of pretty absurd 

emendous high, you can just charge any price, like, you 
cannot charge any price. I think making our cars more affordable is also a 
fundamentally part of the transformation. So, yes, is there anything you 
want to add?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. I'll just add to 
that. I agree completely. What I'll add is that, generally 
speaking, within the Model 3 lineup, the pricing adjustments for our higher 
trim [ph] cars were slightly more than that for the Standard Plus. So, the 

 
so we'll see how the data plays out on this 
as we take in more orders, but 
the expectation is that our mix will move towards higher trim to some extent 
offsetting some of the ASP adjustments from the pricing changes.
 
And one other thing I'll add is that, we are focusing on a couple of markets 
as wel
l to target and identify some of our sales, and so some of our pricing 
adjustments reflect those elements of that strategy.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Essentially, like, we expect average selling prices to be the same within 
a few percentage points.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
T
hat's correct.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Generally, on ASP, as we noted in the letter, it was roughly 
--
 
even over the 
course of the quarter, stabilized around $50,000, and we have good visibility 
into where ASPs are going based on order data. So tha
t gives us one to two 
months of lead as to where our actual recognized ASPs will be.
 
And so, I would expect some adjustment to our Model 3 ASPs as a result of 
this pricing change, but the trim mix will offset some of that. And we 
continue to make great pro
gress on cost efficiencies. And so, overall in that 
our expectation is that the Model 3 gross margin will continue to grow.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. On the gross margin point, like the full self
-
driving is just 

 
is an 
extremely important part of the margin calculat
ion, and the features for full 
self
-
driving are 

 
only a portion of them have rolled out. So, the revenue 
recognition on the full self
-
driving option is limited at first until those 
features roll out and also the demand for full self
-
driving package is lim
ited 
because the features are mostly prospective instead of current.
 
But as those features roll out, I would expect the take rate for full self
-
driving to increase significantly as well as the recognition 
--
 
revenue 
recognition for full self
-
driving to obv
iously match the roll out of the product. 
So, the gross margin over time will be really quite compelling when factoring 
in the full self
-
driving option which is yes, accounted to $7,000 in mid
-
August, and that number will increase over time.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. The second question is many of us who follow Tesla 
closely are incredibly excited about Battery and Powertrain Investor Day and 
its technology implications. Can you provide us any more detail on when this 
will be and what will be cover
ed?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I think for Battery Day, we're going to do a comprehensive review of 
cell chemistry, module and pack, architecture, and a manufacturing plan 
that has a clear roadmap to a terawatt
-
hour per year. The time for this 
probably is about six mo
nths like maybe February or March next year, show 
and tell [ph].
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is you stated on the Q4 
2018 earnings call that customer service was a personal priority for 2019. 
Can you update us on what has be
en done to
-
date to ensure that all owners 
are receiving an industry
-
leading customer experience?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. I meet with the service team multiple times a week and get daily 
updates on the reliability of the vehicle. We 
--
 
the best service of course is
 
no service. That's like the vehicle just reliability and quality being so good 
that service is rarely required. That's what the main goal is like, eliminate 
the need for services.
 
Then in terms of increasing service resources, initially we're opening serv
ice 
centers as fast as we can and have already opened to 25 new service 
locations this quarter and that will increase 
--
 
the rate of service center 
opening will increase dramatically through the course of this year as well as 
more Mobile Service.
 
Mobile Se
rvice is really great, because it's like we just come to you and fix 
the car wherever you are, and that's hard to beat that for convenience. For 
cost delivery, we've made vast improvements to logistics for getting parts to 
service centers. Hey, Jerome do y
ou want 
--
 
Jerome 
--
 
how we manage the 
service 
--
 
global service and
--
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Yes, as you pointed out, the best service is no service. So, we're trying to 
continue improving the quality of the cars and track this daily and fewer and 
fewer 
service visits are required from the most recent cars that we're 
building. So, we're on a good trend there. We also need a lot fewer work to 
finish the cars in the factory. Besides that, we still we are making more parts 
to all the service centers and we s
hip everything same day pretty much so 
that people don't have to wait for cars 
--
 
for parts, and we accelerate service 
and increase capacity. There's a lot of improvements that we've already 
implemented and many more on the way. So, I am relatively optimis
tic and 
I'm happy to help with the service team.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. We had the regional service heads of U.S. at the factory last week, and 
it was incredibly helpful, just a closed loop on with service and production 
and with the software team. And for example
, like a lot of services visits are 
just questions about how to use the car and...
 
Jerome Guillen
 
And it's the number one visit is, how to use Autopilot test. So, yes, a bit of 
education there helps.
 
Elon Musk
 
Like how do I turn it on.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Like, it's good. It's like how do I turn it on? Okay. So just providing better 
feedback on user interface and usually how do you turn it on. And yes, a 
whole bunch of things that are quite elementary to reduce service load.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Th
e next question is; in April, Gigafactory one had efficiency of about 
23 out of the 35
-
gigawatt hours theoretical capacity. Has this been improved 
yet? And is Tesla still cell constrained? Are there any near
-
term plans to 

apacity?
 
Elon Musk
 
Drew?
 
Drew Baglino
 
We have seen improvements in the 23
-
gigawatt hour number. We're in the 
high 20s now with the trajectory continuing upward. We're not...
 
Elon Musk
 
So about 28
-
ish?
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes 28
-
ish. I would say, we're not so cons
trained for any of our activities at 
the moment.
 
Elon Musk
 
Cell volume is approximately matching the production ramp rate.
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Thank you very much. And the last question is what is the new laser 
facility?
 
Elon Musk
 
Nothing major. It's just a distribution warehouse.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Yes, we're optimizing the real estate trying to conciliate everything under 

 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Thank you very much. Latif, we can s
tart the Q&A question queue on 
the call.
 
Operator
 
Yes sir. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Galves of Wolfe 
Research. Your line is open.
 
Dan Galves
 
Hey, thanks very much for taking the questions, and congrats on the $5 
billion cash number, I'm
 
halfway expecting to some headlines tomorrow of 
seeing Tesla's got too much cash on the balance sheet.
 
I was wondering if you could update us on Gigafactory China. We don't have 
a great sense of what delivery volumes in China are for Model 3 at the 
moment
. Some sources are around maybe 3,000 or 4,000 per month. What 
have you seen in terms of order flow and demand since you announced 
pricing at a local product that gives you confidence that you can get to 3,000 
per week type of demand in that market?
 
Elon M
usk
 
Yes, we don't talk too much about like detailed price plans, but are you 
asking like what do I think the long
-
term demand for Model 3 is in Greater 
China region? I think it's about, from Shanghai Gigafactory, I think it's 
actually 
--
 
long
-
term demand i
s about 5,000 a week.
 
Dan Galves
 
Okay. And 
--
 
sounds good. And have you considered potentially sourcing 
cars to Europe from that China plant at all?
 
Elon Musk
 
No. Our plan is to source cars to Greater Europe area from Fremont, 
California until we have Euro
pean Gigafactory operational. And that's 
--
 
but 
that's probably a couple of years before, it's probably 2021 before we have 
an operational Gigafactory in Europe. And so, until that time, we will source 
from California. Yeah, it's like, this is a speculatio
n and it's my opinion, but 
so what I think say long
-
term demand is for Model 3, it's probably 15,000 
units a week globally something like that.
 
Dan Galves
 
Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
 
Martin Viecha
 

 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Your 
line is open.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you can comment about whether you felt 
that Q2 benefited from consumers in the U.S. sort of rushing out to
 
buy 
Model 3 in advance of the declining federal tax credit, a phenomenon that 
you sort of saw in Q4. And part of the reason I ask is, at least by my 
analysis it looks like maybe 70% of the Model 3 sold in the quarter were in 
the U.S., which is sort of hig
her than your normalized percentage of U. S. 
sales. And so, do you feel that that phenomena may have occurred in Q2? 
And are you still confident that Q3 deliveries can improve sequentially? And 
beyond the data point that you provided on the call that the o
rders quarter 
data are better than last quarter, is there anything else you can point to that 
provides that confidence?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I think we'll 
--
 
demand in Q3 will exceed Q2. It has thus far, and I 
think we'll see some acceleration of that. So 
--
 
an
d then, I think Q4 will be, I 
think very strong. So, we expect that quarter
-
over
-
quarter improvements. I 
think Q1 next year will be tough. I think Q3 or Q4 will be good, Q1 will be 
tough. Q2 will be not as bad, but still tough. And then I see like Q3 and Q
4 
next year will be incredible.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, just to add on the tax credit step down, so the step down from Q2 to 
Q3 was significantly lower than the step down from Q4 to Q1. It's also 
important to keep in mind that there's seasonality in the 
auto business in 
Q1, which also is part of the impact. But generally speaking, our order rates 
so far this quarter is higher than where we were at this point in Q2, and we 
haven't seen a significant impact on U.S. based orders as a result of the step 
down.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Okay. Thank you for that. If I could just follow
-
up. Elon, I'm wondering, if 
you can comment on whether you believe Model 3 is having any 
cannibalization impact on S and X sales or why you think that 

 
or why else 
there might be sort of a 
structural step down in the demand and delivery 

 
Elon Musk
 
Actually, we're just talking about this earlier today. We're not quite sure 
ourselves. I think there's some cannibalization, maybe
 
false expectation in 
the market that there's like some big overhaul coming for S and X, which 
would then cause people to hesitate to buy, if they think there's some like 
radical redesign coming, which is why I've stated publicly that this is not the 
case.
 
The Model S and X today are radically better than the ones that 

 
when we 
first started production, especially S. Like say like 2013 or 2012 Model S 
compared to today's Model S night and day. In fact, I still run into people I 
know, who have like 2013 Mod
el S, and they think it hasn't changed. And 
like it is dramatically better in every way. But we don't do model years. We 
just roll in improvements as they come. So 

 
but I think there is maybe a 
communications issue, where people don't realize just how muc
h better the 
S and X are today than when we first started.
 
And I think we actually want to address that communications issue and just 
get a better understanding of

 
from the front lines like what demand should 
be higher for S and X than it is and will get 
to the bottom of it and fix it.
 
Martin Viecha
 

 
Operator
 
Next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is 
open.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Hey, it's Edison on for Emmanuel. Just first
 
question on the guidance, I know 
previously there was a target out there of 25% kind of on S and X and Model 
3. Just wondering is the updated one is that suggesting that that's no longer 
in play for the year or kind of what are the implications with today
's update?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, if you factor in the full self
-
driving option. I think it is in play for the 
year. We seem to get the features done, make sure they are great, roll them 
out, and recognize revenue and increase the take rate on full self
-
driving. 
There's also 

 
for the existing fleet, there's a very significant opportunity to 
upgrade the existing fleet to full self
-
driving. Since mostly he has not 
purchased this option yet. So there's a significant margin potential for the 
existing fleet to upgrade
 
to full self
-
driving, which most of the fleet can. So, 
yes, absolutely, I think, like long term we are talking 25%, 30%. Not long 
term meaning like a year. Long term, like, in terms of vernacular that 30% 
gross margin is I think quite likely.
 
Zachary Kirk
horn
 
Yes. We continue to take significant costs out of the Model 3 in particular as 
well and Jerome can comment further on this. But every week 
--
 
nearly 
every week we had record lows on our labor content to build the vehicle. 
And we saw an ASP adjustment,
 
net reduction in Model 3 from Q1 to Q2, yet 
the gross profit on the vehicle expanded, attributed to the cost reduction 
efforts that are underway.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Labor cost saw more than 50% reduction in one year. Yes, it's progressing 
every quarter.
 
Elon 
Musk
 
Yes. I just want, like, to see what the labor hours were quarter
-

quarter.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Yes. Reduced in half, yes, since the Q3 last year, but it's also all the

the fact that's associated with spares, the scrap is reduced to pretty much 
n
othing, reduced 90% year

year. Spares are just more than half. So 
we're

our goal is to make the car more affordable and sort of pushing 
everyday, yes. And every week we'll beat records on most lines.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
And in terms of ou
tput and cost per unit, yes. We're in very good dynamic 
and level of fiscal discipline that I have not 
--
 
we have not had in the past.
 
Elon Musk
 
Agreed, yes. So, like, for a core financial health standpoint, I think, I'd just 
like to echo Jerome's 
words, like, I think Tesla's fiscal discipline is 
dramatically better than times in the past.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha of JMP 
Securities. Your line is open.
 
Joseph Osha
 
Hello, hello. Listen 
--
 
listening to yo
u talk about mix here and the fact that 
you're running a single shift of your S and X facilities in Fremont, I'm 
wondering is there maybe some potential to reconfigure the floor space 
there a bit? And is that something that you're thinking about?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we are reconfiguring the floor space at Fremont and there's quite a lot 
of factory space that's probably taken up with the S, X parts warehousing, 
parts for the S, X line. And we don't really need that, so that's where we're 
putting a lot of the Mod

 
Jerome Guillen
 
Yes. We are improving the material delivery for S and X just like we have 
done for Model 3 of some ready components. We reduced production part 
warehousing costs by again 90%, 9
-
0, since Q3 last year an
d so we're 
making a lot of room. We have 
-
 
we're much more efficient with parts 
delivery.
 

out, I'm looking at it right now in Fremont, which is going to put Model Y 
stuff in ther
e. So every 
--
 
if you visit the factory from, I would say, every six 
months you'd have a hard time recognizing and finding their way. Yeah. It's 
constantly changing and evolving.
 
Joseph Osha
 
And as a follow 
--
 
I'm sorry, go ahead.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Yes, just 
like efficiently factory, both Fremont and Giga is like just the 
rate of improvement which is not slowing down has been incredible. It's like 
you're just like you can feel it and see it.
 
Joseph Osha
 
And just as a follow
-
on then, could we see you manage to 
make 8,000, 
7,500, 8,000 Model 3s in Fremont by the end of the year you think?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Joseph Osha
 
Okay. Thank you very much.
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean I feel confident it's 
--
 
let's just say that the trend is very clearly 
towards being able to get to 10,000
 
vehicles a week of which that would be 
-
-
 
there is rough numbers like 8,300 to 8,600 Model 3s and the balance in S 
and X. So, there's sort of 1,600 to 1,800 SX. In round numbers 8,500 3s, 
1,500 SX per week, but probably a bit more than that.
 
Operator
 
Than
k you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Levy from Credit 
Suisse. Your line is open.
 
Dan Levy
 
Hi, great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your Reg 
credits in particular the non
-
ZEV piece. You're not disclosing the ZEV piece 
anymore, but just a couple of questions on this. First how can we think 
--
 
is 
there any quarterly cadence to think about this?
 
And then what's the composition of this? Is this going purely to European 
OEMs? There's obviously one automaker that you've agree
d with. I don't 
know if there are any others that you're looking at.
 
And lastly to what extent can you 
--
 
or are you willing to sacrifice pricing in 
Europe to sell higher volumes to generate more Reg credits? And are you 
having discussions with other autom
akers on this one?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes, on your question about the cadence of regulatory credits, it's 
--
 
it is 
--
 
generally as I've commented in the past, we expect regulatory credits to 
become a more meaningful part of our business.
 
On a 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter basis, it's very difficult to forecast to them. As you 
saw from Q1 to Q2, that declined. And as you model regulatory credits in 
Q3, I would not expect a significant increase in regulatory credits, although 
it's hard to forecast exactly.
 
The regulatory credits composition is a mixture of these particular deals that 
are one
-
time. There's also some that are production
-
based over time. 
Production
-
based ones are easier to forecast because it's based on cars that 
we build and we get an outset t
o that way. The deal
-
specific ones are 
lumpier which makes it more difficult.
 
And then your final question was on does it make sense to sacrifice pricing 
to drive regulatory credit in certain markets. It might. I'm not sure if we've 
specifically gone into 
the details of that, but generally, we're selling cars in 
markets at the prices we think are appropriate and the regulatory credits 
into something traditional. We generally try not to run the business based on 
regulatory credit revenue.
 
Elon Musk
 
The regul
atory credits is like I mean it's a relatively small part of the 
equation for Tesla. So, 
--
 
I think the ZEV credit situation, I think, really 
needs reformed because the market for ZEV credits is negligible. Now some 
of what's happening here is, other manuf
acturers are kind of like waiting to 
see how their EV sales due before buying any credits from Tesla. And so it 
kind of depends on how that goes, if they sell more EVs then there's not 
really any to do deal with Tesla and if they sell fewer [than theirs].
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of 
Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
 
Colin Rusch
 
Can you walk us through the plan for battery sourcing in China? How many 
-
-
 
how much of the 
supply is going to come from internally produced 
batteries? How much is coming from externally? And what's your expectation 
around cost per watt hours as you start to ramp?
 
Elon Musk
 
I don't know if we want to talk about the details of battery supply. We'v
e got 
a good handle on. We don't expect to be self constrained in China for the 
next year, I don't know. Drew what do you think?
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes, that's what our plan looks like right now. In terms of internal versus 
external, I think we should wait until
 
we have our discussion early next year. 
But yes, we have agreements in place with 
--
 
we're good for next year as 
you say Elon.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think you probably need to study or reset like Master Plan for our 
Powerplant 3, but it's really like yes to some de
gree, but Battery Day will be 
kind of national 
--
, which is like okay, how do we get from kind of 

 
any
-
tens 
of gigawatt hours per year to multiple terawatt hours per year.
 
What's 
--
 
that's a pretty dry scale increase in 
--
 
so yes. Sort of roughly 100, 
lik
e a 28 gigawatt hours right now well actually there is one where you count 
the factories in Japan so, a little over 30% to 35% or something like that. 
And how do we get like 2 terawatt hours a year? What would you like? So to 
order bank to increase.
 
Zachar
y Kirkhorn
 
That's the way you have to think about it because that's what you need to 
do.
 
Elon Musk
 
Exactly. In order to make fundamental shift in the world's energy usage and 
really transform things to sustainable energy future, if you're not in the 
terawa
tt hour range it's like, it's a nice new story but it is not fundamentally 
changing the energy equation.
 
Colin Rusch
 
Okay. And can I have a follow
-
up question around Model S and Model X 
saturation? Obviously you guys have some ideas around how big that 
mar
ket is? How should we be thinking about sustainable volumes and pricing 
on those volumes?
 
Obviously we're seeing some lower numbers here and I think that's a core 
element of what's going on with the story that as we see pricing drop and 
volumes drop what a
re the right numbers to think about you guys from a 
planning standpoint in terms of sellthrough on both the Model S and Model 
X?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I think it's probably too much focused on S and X . The S and X 
--
 
they 
are nice, but they're not 
--
 
and 
it's like without them we couldn't spell sexy. 
So the main reason, well not the main reason, but a reason is we want to 
keep spelling sexy. So, that is a reason, I should say not the main reason, 
but a reason to keep going with the S and X.
 
But the story f
or Tesla in future is fundamentally Model 3 and Model Y and I 
think like my guess is like long
-
term sales of 

 
long term meaning, a couple 
of years I think. The demand for 
--
 
sales demand for 3 is like on the order of 
three quarters of a million units a ye
ar, and it's probably 1.25 million per 
year for Model Year, so they combined is like maybe two million from those 
two vehicles, and then S/X is like there may be 80,000 to 100,000 a year. 
So it's like 4% or 5% of the volume in 3 and Y. And then you could t
hrow 
like a truck in there, pickup truck and a semi, but it just gets smaller and 

--
 
from a volume 
standpoint, they're not all that important in the long
-
term.
 
Martin Viecha
 

uestion please.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Your 
line is open.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Hey, thank you for taking my question. I'd like to ask you Elon about 
distributions. So you made like 
--
 
you guys made a big chan
ge at the 
beginning of the year going from like an almost 100% on line distribution 
model, you tried to push back on test drive and get people to buy the car, 
try it and return it if they don't like it. So could you give us an update on 
how it is progressi
ng? Do you see this start becoming mostly like an online 
distribution on 
--
 
following an online distribution model? And I saw you 
opened 25 new retail locations in the quarter, so how do you see your retail 
footprints evolving over time?
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually
 
we've opened 25 service locations. I think really what we find is that 
the word
-
of
-
mouth for Tesla is incredibly good. So once there's a new piece 
of customers in a particular area, they love the cars and they talk to all their 
friends about it and that's
 
really what drives sale.
 
So if you think of like retail locations like a viral seed in an area. It would 
grow organically by itself, but the retail location actually is like a viral seed. 
It's not, they aren't needed, they are just 
--
 
they are like an acc
elerant.
 
What is needed for sales in any given area and I'd say this worldwide, 
frequently told
 
like this country is different or that country is different. Like people around 
the world pretty much want the same thing in my experience. They have to 
have a 
service location that's convenient, so it can't be like you've got to 
drive eight to five hours to a service location. So, you got to have service, 
you to have supercharging and charging all sorted out, you could have good 
consumer financing and then the p
rice must make sense. And any place 
where those four things are true, our sales are great. So, we're rolling out 
service centers like crazy. Service centers are the key to sales, not the retail 
locations.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah. And we're going city
-
by
-
city
 
on the service center point. We're looking 
at where our populations are of existing customers. We're mapping driving 
times from those customers to the service centers inclusive of traffic to 
improve densification of our service centers in locations in whi
ch our 
customers currently reside. We do have areas that are underrepresented for 
service centers, where the drive time is too long, where there are population 
that don't have appropriate access to charging or service centers and we are 
working as fast as 
we can to get places up and running in those areas. So 
it's very systematically being mapped out with a focus on service and 
supercharging as opposed to our retail presence.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Supercharging is incredibly important to us. You can't just have l
ike 
80% of the routes somebody who wants to take, you need 100% routes, a 
car is like it's really a freedom to travel, anything that inhibits freedom of 
travel, it 

impairs the fundamental value of the product.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
All perceived.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yea
h, exactly, real all perceived freedom of travel.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question please.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your 
question please.
 
Joseph Spak
 
Thanks. So, Elon you mentioned the 
importance of full self
-
driving for gross 
margin. You've also mentioned the importance of China. Do you expect to be 
able to offer the full self
-
driving suite that you plan to offer in the U.S. and 
China? And I guess, even in Europe, where they've also bee
n a little bit 
tougher on regulating?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, we expect to be able to offer full self
-
driving actually everywhere 
except EU, because there's just some committee rules that were put in place 
years ago that needs to be changed. It's not from a technical standpoint, it's 
very doable but we just nee
d to work through the regulatory committees to 
get the regulatory approvals and rules changed. It's just 

 
it all just take a 
bit longer than other places.
 
But I think, we'll see a lot of pressure from our customers in Europe to have 
these rules changed, s
o they can have access to full self
-
driving. And I think 
at the end of the day, the regulators will answer to the public. So I think 
that's just a temporary thing and it's as quite specific to the 

 
to EU rules. 
And we're just not present really when those
 
rules were drafted. So that's 
why 

 
got to put in place. But they're making a ton of sense, but we just got 
to work through the process to change them.
 
Joseph Spak
 
Okay. And then the second question is you know, you mentioned service a 
number of times. Th
ere's always been some I think growing frustration with 
owners. And you mentioned parts availability and you've issued the 
dealership model, but I guess how do you plan on increasing parts 
availability without the corresponding working capital commitment t
hat 
would be required as the fleet continues to grow?
 
Elon Musk
 
It's actually just taking the parts that were stored in a bunch of warehouses, 
and just moving them to the service centers. And kind of the just 

 
the thing 
that make sense is to I think to ha
ve the service centers where the parts are 
kind of all on the wall, it's like a supermarket. Like, you know, you always 
know, where like the Cocoa Puffs are and you can just go eat there and go 
and grab it and you just replenish the shelves with parts.
 
And
 
so what we're basically putting all parts that are used more frequently 
than like six weeks on 
--
 
the tray on the walls on service centers. There's no 
ordering of the parts, you just go take it off the shelf and put it on the car. 
Really want to get to, n
ot merely same
-
day service, but same hour, sort of, 
like, definitely, which applied generally to service.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. And specifically on the working capital piece of this, we actually have a 
significant amount of service parts inventory. The cha
llenge is, it's just not 
at the service centers.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And so a lot of the lag that is experienced is, we have to get the part from 
the distribution center to the service center. And so by moving 
--
 
by 
localizing the parts, I don'
t expect that to be a large working capital drain on 
the company. It might actually be the reverse, where we don't need to store 
as many parts eventually.
 
Elon Musk
 

--
 
if we make them 
internally or if they're made at a supplier, just sending them directly to the 
service center, instead of like having them go through a bunch of 
distribution outlets. It's 
--
 
in fact like when I was in China, from my the last 
trip, I was like, actually the
 
China team here, is there anything silly that 
we're doing that we should fix. And they said, yes.
 
Well, several of the parts that require replacement are literally made in 
China and then we end up shipping them to New Jersey and then back to 
China. And co
uld we please just ship them like literally across the road. And 
like, yes, no problem. There's always like crazy things that happen as 
--
 
if 
you're like 
--
 
if you have a 45,000 person company and then just basically 
stop doing silly things. It's 
--
 
yes, a
 
lot of what is needed for improvement.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And as the scale of the business increases, the economics of localization, of 
things like parts distribution make a lot more sense. Whereas in the past 
when the company was smaller having centralized
 
centers was easier from a 
cost perspective.
 
So the business 
--
 
because the company is growing so fast, as Elon has 
mentioned, we have to continue to redesign processes and systems to re
-
stabilize ourselves on a new plateau of volume.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Zachar
y Kirkhorn
 
And then, we'll grow again and we'll need to rebuild those processes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean, Tesla is the only company made some things that volume that 
is fully product integrated all the way through sales and service and charge 
of everything. 
So we really just need to look at the total system efficiency 
and say in the limit, if Tesla was the auto industry, how would we do it to 
maximize economic efficiency.
 
And that's 
--
 
we're got to kind of like recalculate that optimization, as we 
achieve gre
ater scale. I'm confident we can achieve a fundamentally better 
economic efficiency than the rest of the auto industry.

11/3/17,Tesla,"Good afternoon. Just a first question on the pre
-
owned program. It seems 
like there's a fair level of success there with $20 million in revenue. I'm just 
curious if you could dimension how many vehicles were sold through that 
program, how many units 
remain in inventory there, and if we think about 
how that inventory is restocked, sort of what percentage of new unit Model 
Ss that are purchased are accompanied by a Model S trade
-
in?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Hang on one 
second.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Hi, John, Deepak here. Firstly, we just kicked off the program in April, so it's 
actually been pretty heartening to see how it's done so far. And to keep it at 
a high level, we're actually selling these cars a
t a faster rate than we are 
getting these trade
-
ins to come in. So as this program picks up, it's going to 
really be a successful program and it's creating good demand for us on the 
pre
-
owned side.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah,
 
and I mean, I'd hesitate to make predictions based on such early 
history, but, I mean, I think there's room for optimism in the future here 
because these are obviously very low 

 
we don't have to make the cars so 
we're essentially getting a commission on 
selling the car and it's very capital 
efficient. So, I think there's some upside potential there, but nothing we 
want to sort of really make predictions on it till we have more of a history.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. Maybe to thi
nk about it sort of in terms of 

 
I mean every vehicle 
that's going into this pre
-
owned program, I would imagine is accompanied 
with a new Model S sale? I'm just trying to understand how the acquisition 
process is working.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Of
ficer
 
Absolutely, yep.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, we accept a trade
-
in only when that customer is buying a new Model 
S, if that's what you're trying to suggest.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of
 
America Merrill Lynch
 
Yes. Yeah, that's sort of what I was trying to get at, understand the 
percentages, but I guess it's too small right now to be too material.
 
And then just a second question, as we think about the referral program, an 
interesting marke
ting angle here, just wondering if you can sort of juxtapose 
what you think the ultimate cost was. It looks like it was about $2,000 all
-
in 
versus your acquisition cost for a customer, and just trying to understand 
where you're going to save money and how 
this makes the sort of the 
customer acquisition process more cost
-
effective?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, it's not necessarily making it more cost
-
effective, it's intended to be 
somewhat of a wash so that if we achieve a $2,00
0 savings we essentially 
passed that on to the end customer. And we don't know what that's really 
going to look like until the program is complete which is sort of almost 90 
days from now. Early indications are quite positive. But, obviously, for this 
90
-
d
ay period, there's going to be some overlap where we essentially incur a 
dual expense for 

 
because we're not 

 
we still have all of our stores and 
we're 

 
have the referral costs. So I don't think it's going to have a big 
impact on our numbers, but there 
will be some dual expense because there's 
no way 

 
have you to kind of run these experiments in parallel, so there's no 
real way to do it otherwise.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
And how did you build up the $2,000 acquisition costs? Becau
se, as you 
mentioned, it seems like there's a lot of fixed costs that wouldn't get taken 
out that quickly in the test phase. I'm just trying to understand how you 
think about that $2,000 number and how you come up with that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Ch
ief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, it's not taken out in the test phase. It's to inform our long
-
term 
decision in terms of how many stores should we open. I mean, a store 
should be thought of as like a demand generation item, and in order to 
understand should we 
do a lot of stores, small number of stores, somewhere 
between, we kind of need to know how this referral program 

 
how effective 
the referral program is. I mean, if you can think of some other way to do 
this that we're not aware of, we'd love to hear about
 
it.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Sure. We'll brainstorm on that. Then just lastly, as we think about the cash 
burn in the quarter but also the setup of the credit lines, it seems like you 
guys are recognizing that, at some point down the
 
line, there might be a 
need for a capital raise. Would you consider an equity raise in the market, or 
do you think these credit lines are enough to lean on for now before you 
ultimately have to make a decision on raising capital in the next 12 months 
to 1
8 months?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, we only drew down $50 million on our credit line, so we have 
sufficient lines available and that's expandable, too, to $750 million, which 
gives us some comfort that we can be close to $1 billion as we
 
go through 
the year, and, clearly, as X ramps up and gets to a steady state, it enables 
us to generate free cash flow. So we feel pretty comfortable overall on that 
front, and we'll just take it as opportunities come in the future.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
So, Deepak, do you think as you go through the launch of the Model X and 
ultimately the Model 3, that you'll turn cash flow positive at the right point 
where you might not need to do a capital raise going forward, is that kind
 
of 
how you're thinking about this with the credit lines on top?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, we are comfortable with the cash levels. I'll put it that way.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I don't think that there's not
 
a need to raise equity capital. There may be 
some value in doing so as a risk reduction measure, but to be clear, we 

 
what Deepak is saying is that even in the absence of any additional capital 
generation activity, we would have on the order of $1 billio
n through 

 
basically that would be, our minimum cash position.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Yeah, no, I think the risk reduction function you mentioned is probably the 
most 

 
is the most valuable, and that's kind of why we're asking abou
t that 
when you look at the cash burn and how the capital market sometimes shift 
very quickly, it just seems like an opportune time to take advantage of what 
you might need in the future, so that's why we're asking.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Execu
tive Officer
 
Yeah, so I think we're in the same sort of mind frame as you are. Yeah.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. Thank you very much.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
All right. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, s
ir. Our next phone question will come from the line of Rod 
Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. A couple of questions. First, maybe you can just elaborate a 
little bit on
 
the drop in the forecast from 55,000 units, to 50,000 units to 
55,000 units. Is there some aspect of the Model X launch that isn't what 
you've projected? It doesn't really sound like this is related at all to the 
backlog of orders from Model S.
 
Elon Reeve
 
Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Correct. I mean, we do think that it's going to be quite a challenging 
production ramp on the X, and if we are faced with a choice of deliver great 

 
we only want to deliver great cars, so we don't want to drive t
o a number 
that's greater than our ability to deliver high quality vehicles, so 

 
and the 
nature of the production ramp which is basically an exponential ramp that 
then becomes an S
-
curve, is basically for every week longer that it takes us 
to climb up tha
t exponential is about an 800 vehicle reduction of the X. But 
that's why we sort of do want to emphasize the longer term, long term, 
really just meaning like Q1 next year type of thing, not super long
-
term. I 
think one gets a better picture of the business
 
just sort of thinking about 
that, and that's where we feel really highly confident of the 1,600 vehicles 
per week to 1,800 vehicles per week combined production of S and X, and 
both production and demand.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay
. The 

 
was there an adjustment from something like 2,000 units a 
week to that 1,600 units to 1,800 units, and are we thinking about like a 48
-
week production year or are you thinking about this in terms of the full 
calendar year?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairma
n & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, so that's a good question. It's like there 

 
yeah, that's averaged over 
the year. So that means, like, in a given week, we might go as high as 2,000 
units to make up for holidays, factory retooling and that kind of thing.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. Your run
-
rate of gross margin, obviously it's being affected by a 
number of things; by launches, by mix, the deferral of Autopilot revenue. 
Can you just talk a little bit about what are some of the issues
 
there, what is 
the issue with Autopilot, would we 

 
would it be reasonable to expect the 
margins to rise again to the 25%
-
plus level once X is out and Gigafactory 
begins to ramp?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Hi, Rod, yeah, definitely. The most o
f the Autopilot deferral, we should be 
able to recover that later this year. There may be a small portion going into 
2016, but difficult to say at this point. And the two big issues that have been 
affecting us, I'd say, is the dollar, the strong dollar, an
d then the mix, 
especially as we have started to build 70D and the 70 cars recently. The 
dollar has had a huge impact just from Q1 to Q2. It took 100 basis points 
out for us roughly. So even after we consider all of that and we look at 2016 
to say that we'
ll be at 25% and better with S and X combined, yes, we 
should be there.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. And just lastly, you've had a few more weeks here since the 
announcement of the stationary storage business, do you have any 
additional thoughts on how that's expected to ramp?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I do want to preface this with some degree of uncertainty, because 
this is quite new, and again, we've got that challenge of exponential ramp 
and
 
then depending upon how you move the 

 
on how the dates fit over an 
exponential ramp, the actual numbers in a given quarter could be quite 
different, but the demand has been really crazy, so it's well in excess of 

 
I 
mean if you just take the reservation
s that have been made thus far, it's 
well over $1 billion worth of Powerpacks and Powerwalls. So 

 
and that's 
with no marketing, no advertising, no sales force to speak of, really, we're 
not trying to sell it, it's basically a presentation and a webcast an
d 30 
minutes of press Q&A.
 
So there's probably room to improve. So this is 

 
I mean, really, we're 
basically sold out of what we could make in 2016 at this point. And assuming 
these orders are real, which they seem to be. So were looking at maybe, 
again, j
ust to preface with meaningful uncertainty, $40 million to $45 million 
in stationary storage in Q4 and maybe as much as 10 times that number in 
for next year. So it's $40 million to $50 million that this year and 10x of that 
next year. And I mean that grow
th rate is probably going to just, keep going 
at quite a nutty level. It's probably at least a few billion dollars in 2017, 
somewhat speculative at this point, but I think that's likely. So it's sort of 
growing by half order of magnitude to an order of mag
nitude per year.

Thank you. A couple of questions regarding the validation units. I was 
wondering regarding Model X, do we have a general ballpark number in 
terms of how many validation units we
 
may have to produce before the 
robots become smart enough?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I'm not sure I totally understand your question.
 
Trip S. Chowdhry 
-
 
Global Equities Research LLC
 
Like when we had the Model S retooling, we cre
ated a few Model S validation 
units, I think probably around 40 units or 50 units which were used to train 
the robots, so...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure.
 
Trip S. Chowdhry 
-
 
Global Equities Research LLC
 
...before the product re
ally goes into production, I do believe there are some 
validation units of the car that are produced so as to train the robots. I could 
be wrong, but that's my understanding.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
No, that's true. There are a
ctually 

 
it's a little more complicated than that 
because there are parts of the factory that are much more automated than 
other parts, so there's 

 
in terms of the programming the robots, it varies 
quite a bit in terms of how much program there is, how d
ifficult that 
programming is. But we actually have now produced several Model Xs off the 
Tesla production line, but this is a complex machine with several thousand 
unique components. So there are still a lot of low volume parts for suppliers 
on the Model X
. And 

 
but with each week, we keep building more and more 
Xs off the line with greater and greater part maturity. And then (17:18), we 
expect to do our first delivery of production of Model Xs at the end of next 
month.

Excellent. I had a question also on the Autopilot. I was wondering are you 
aware of this research paper from Alex, I think they also call it AlexNet. In 
few conferences we went, they talk a lot about image classification, 
especially with 
NVIDIA. And if you haven't heard about it, that's fine. But if 
you have heard about it, I was wondering, are we working with some similar 
technologies with Autopilot or we are doing everything in
-
house in terms of 
image recognition and auto steering?
 
Elon 
Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
The overall system is designed by Tesla, but then there's components from a 
number of other suppliers. The Autopilot or the auto steer, highway 
Autopilot essentially is using a combination of the Ford camera,
 
Ford radar, 
the sight ultrasonics, and then the GPS navigation system. So it integrates 
those four systems in order to do auto steer on the highway. And yeah, so 
that's what we're sort of working out the final details on. We're targeting 
release to our ea
rly access customers, on August 15, and then depending 
upon how that is received and what issues we encounter in different parts of 
the world, we expect to go to wide release on Autopilot, highway Autopilot 
and auto park in one to two months after that.

And last question I have regarding the calendar year 2016 production. I was 
wondering in 2015, this current year, we are having a few retooling and 
getting the assembly lines, or I should say the 
production lines of Model X 
and Model S a little up and coming. Do we see any similar disruption 
happening in 2016 or we're pretty much straight? And when we put the 
Model 3 line in place, it will be completely isolated from Model X and Model 
S?
 
Elon Reeve
 
Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
There are periodic down periods in order to do equipment maintenance 
where that can't be accomplished and, let's say, on a Saturday and Sunday. 
But we're not anticipating any significant downtime for S and X as a 
sort of, 
like, maybe it's one or two weeks out of the year, something like that. And 
those are 

 
because we do productivity improvements to reduce the 
production cost and, like I said, just general equipment maintenance. For 
the Model 3, we really are doin
g our best to make sure that it does not affect 
S and X production. We don't currently anticipate it affecting S and X 
production in 2016, but there may be some effect in 2017.
 
Trip S. Chowdhry 
-
 
Global Equities Research LLC
 
If I may squeeze in one more, y
ou did mention that Model X production is 
challenging, like there's a difference between saying doable and undoable 
and everything is challenging in the world, like 

 
I was wondering, like, we 
have a control over this challenge because every problem is, if
 
it's not a 

 
(21:07) enjoy something and not challenging. You're saying it's 

 
from a 
challenging, like it is out of control, or challenging because you're enjoying 
doing it?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I think there's 

 
som
e things are definitely a lot more challenging than 
others. And the Model X is I think a particularly challenging car to build. 
Maybe the hardest car to build in the world. I'm not sure what would be 
harder.

Morgan Stanley. Your questions, please.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hey, Elon, Deepak. First question, Steve Jurvetson wa
s recently quoted 
saying that Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick, told him that if, by 2020, Tesla's cars 
are autonomous, that he'd want to buy all of them. Is this a real 

 
I mean, 
forget like the 2020 for a moment, but is this a real business opportunity for 
Tesl
a, supplying cars to ridesharing firms, or does Tesla just cut out the 
middleman and sell on
-
demand electric mobility services directly from the 
company on its own platform?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
That's an insightful question
.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
You don't have to answer it.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I think 

 
I don't think I should answer it.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Let's move on. Second question
 
is, there's been 

 
sometimes you can 
tell more from the non
-
answer than from the answer 

 
there's been a lot of 
excitement about mapping technology for autonomous and semi
-
autonomous applications with a German consortium bidding firm for HERE, 
Nokia's bus
iness. I would love to hear your views, Elon, on how you view 
Tesla's mapping capabilities. Is this something you need to license, continue 
licensing from outside vendors or can you use your own unique connected 
machine learning fleet to build your own map
ping capabilities and be self
-
sufficient? Or you rather not answer that one?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, the fact of the matter is, there's not publicly available data that is 
sufficiently accurate for Autopilot as far as 
navigation data, street data, it's 
too coarse. So it looks like we don't really have much choice, but to create 
our own data set for driving in order to 

 
in the long
-
term, in order to 
provide a high quality Autopilot experience. Yeah, I mean, it's 

 
yeah,
 
that's 
just the only way we can think of to do it.

Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question is I'm just curious what the 
new guidance for range of deliveries, 50,000 units to 55,000 units v
ersus 
55,000 units prior, what does that mean, if anything, for the earlier target of 
free cash flow break
-
even in 4Q, is that something we should think about 
maybe more in 1Q 2016 then?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Certainly in 1Q we will be fre
e cash flow positive. Q4, it's hard to predict, 
given that range, certainly towards the end as Model X deliveries are 
ramping up we would be, but then if you look at the full quarter, it's 
somewhat close to call.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just last question, it seems like 
we've seen a number of announcements into quarter now by utilities and 
other companies about using your Powerpack, companies like Amazon, et 
cetera. I'm curious how much of the 
Tesla Energy business do you now 
expect to generate from corporate or institutional demand versus more retail 
customers? I'd be interested to if 

 
this mix and expectation, if it's changed 
over time at all since you first debut the product.
 
Jeffrey B. Stra
ubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Sure. This is JB. We're getting a little bit better sense of it, but it's still early 
days and I think initially we thought that the majority of the business would 
be the Powerpack in the commercial or institutional business
 
and we've 
actually been a bit surprised at how strong the Powerwall, the retail demand 
is and the interest is. So I 

 
again, it's hard to guess at numbers, but I 
would say that we're perhaps in the 

 
maybe not quite close to 50/50, but I 
think 70% perhaps
 
Powerpack.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's really early days because 

 
a big dependency here is when someone 
orders the P
owerpack, how many Powerpacks do they order, and 

 
so 
Powerpack is sort of 100 kilowatt hours, and 

 
but industrial and utility 
customers may order as many as 100 or 200. I'm not sure what's our 
biggest one so far, is it like 200?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chi
ef Technology Officer
 
(26:38) in that order of magnitude, 100s.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, so I think our biggest one is around 250 or so. So, yeah, it could be 
quite a large, in terms of kilowatt hours, quite a large amount
 
going in the 
direction of Powerpack. In terms of unit volume, the Powerwall would be the 
greatest. But the likely thing for Powerwall is somebody is going to order 
maybe one to three, maybe it's average of 1.5 or something like that, 
whereas Powerpack cou
ld be an average of five to 10.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, and I think as the market grows and as we go further into the future, 
we're going to see more and more total energy demand coming from 
Powerpack. That's still our expectat
ion.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, a real important thing to understand, I mean, 
maybe with drilling it a little bit that for stationary storage, the fundamental 
economics of cost are always true, meaning that there's always a cost 
advantage to someone 

 
to a syst
em
-
wide implementation of stationary 
storage, because of the high peak to trough electricity usage. So, if you have 
buffering, which is what stationary storage allows for, then you only need 
your power plants to operate at the average energy usage, which m
eans 
that you can basically, in principle, shutdown half of the world's power plants 
if you had stationary storage. This is independent of renewable energy. It 
does not matter whether you have solar panels (28:33), this is just being 
able to shut down half
 
of your power plants if you have buffering, because 
you can then have your power plant output at the average of what is needed 
by the consumers.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
I see. That's very interesting.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief 
Executive Officer
 
Yeah. It seems like sometimes people link this too much to renewable 
energy. Of course we're huge believers in renewal energy, but that is not the 
gating function of demand for stationary storage. Stationary storage is really 
as compared 
to existing power plants.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. And then, like, depending on the country, that may be represented as 
a price to the user of the electricity. S
o, for example, in Germany and 
Australia, there is time
-
based cost of electricity. It's like, it costs more 
sometimes today than others. Whereas in most of the U.S. you just have a 
meter that's ticking over. So it doesn't differentiate between, say, day us
e of 
energy or night use of energy. So in places where the price represents the 
cost, the Powerwall makes economic sense, but the Powerpack makes sense 
everywhere.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman

Thank you, sir. Our next phone qu
estion will come from Patrick Archambault 
with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your questions, please.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Oh, yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to 
follow up on the Autopilot, and I
'm sorry if you guys have said this, but can 
we talk a little bit more about the capability that that's going to bring? Is 
that kind of a hands
-
off, feet
-
off kind of product that would be somewhere 
close to NHTSA Level 3, or we're just talking about kind o
f more Lane Keep 
Assist and Forward Collision Warning, that sort of stuff, that that would still 
be kind of one to two? Let me just start off with that question.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I'm not too familiar with what the 
various (31:01) levels mean, but I 
can tell you just what it will translate to in the initial Autopilot. The 

 
we 
don't want to set the expectation that it's 

 
that you can just basically pay 
no attention to what the car is doing, we do want to set the exp
ectation that 
it's much like the Autopilot in a plane where you turn the Autopilot on in a 
plane but there's still some expectation that the pilot will pay attention to 
what the plane is doing and weren't sort of go to sleep or disappear from the 
cockpit. 
So we do want to set that expectation with consumers.
 
That said, in terms of what the capability of the system is, I think it's 
capability in steering and control of acceleration and braking is excellent. 
When it has a tracking vehicle in front and you can
 
basically have high 
confidence in steering, braking, and acceleration when basically when you're 
in some kind of traffic situation where there's a car on the road in front of 
you. I think it's pretty good in the absence of that, so if it's just lanes, it'
s 
pretty good, and it will get better over time as we refine the software. So I 
would certainly not take the initial version of Autopilot as the final version. It 
will just get better and better over time.

Patrick K. Archambault

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
And then I take it there's some kind of human machine interface t
hing that 
keeps you focused and beeps if you try and use your BlackBerry or 
something?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
That's still something that we're debating and I think we want to see how 
the early access program goes. That's basi
cally our public beta. And based 
on that, we'll set the warning levels. Yeah.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Got it. More of a guidance question, it was touched on earlier that the 1,600 
vehicles per week to 1,800 vehicles per week is down fr
om I think what was 
being floated around as 2,000 vehicles per week for next year's production 
level. I get that the production overall might be lower based on a slower 
ramp, but is there something structural that's keeping you from hitting that 
2,000 vehi
cles per week on a run
-
rates basis, understanding that you can 
kind of surge to that at certain points? Is there something that kind of in 
preparing for the launch you've realized that you're just not going to have 
the capacity that you thought you would h
ave?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Frankly, the main thing is we don't want to set high expectations and then 
the only way for us to feel good about the future is that if we exceed really 
high expectations. So it's sort of like 
winning needs to feel like winning, if 
that makes any sense. So that's really why we're sort of setting those 
numbers. Could we do 2,000 vehicles per week? Aspirationally, yes. Do we 
want to commit to that? Ideally not. Yeah.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldm
an Sachs & Co.
 
Got it. Understood. Just setting the bar at achievable levels is something 
that makes sense. And just last one for me, like an accounting issue, I think 
there was, like, a $0.10 gain or a $0.13 gain on, like, FX revaluation. Like, I 
don't kn
ow, Deepak, I didn't know what that was exactly.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, that's driven by our balance sheet, currency, and receivables 
revaluations that happen at the quarter end exchange rates. It's not really 

 
it's not representativ
e of what happens during the quarter, in the middle of 
the months, and based on where the exchange rates were, we had good 
news this time from that revaluation, clearly as you're aware, Q1 we had 
significant bad news, and if you really net the two out on a
 
full year basis, 
it's a small number.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay, got it. So it's just the impact of transactional stuff sequentially?
 
Deepak Ahuja

Deepak Ahuja

Just to clarify, it's translational and transactional in the sense that w

that impact has to flow through income.

CLSA. 
Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Emmanuel Rosner

CLSA Americas LLC
 
Hi, good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to start just with a quick math 
question. So your comments suggested that the 

 
if there's any sort of delay 
towards the end of Q4, this would h
ave an impact of about 800 Model X 
units per week. And then you're also guiding to about 1,600 to 1,800 
combined volumes of production per week next year. Does that just 
simplistically mean that you're targeting the mix to be roughly 50/50 
between X and S 
right from the get
-
go in 2016?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It does, although I wouldn't put too much precision on that because what 
we're going to try to do is to push the production slightly more in the 
direction of X because peop
le have been waiting for a long time for their 
cars. And then, in any given month it could be 60/40 one way or the other. 
If you look at worldwide demand for SUVs and sedans, it's almost dead
-
even, at 50/50. And in some regions, sedans are favored. In some
 
regions, 
SUVs are favored. But generally it's, on a worldwide basis, 50/50. But it is 
difficult for us to say exactly what the S/X demand ratio will be until the car 
is out there and people are experiencing it and we see what the relative 
order volume is.
 
But we have so many advanced orders on the X that this 
will be not going to be an issue in the early days, and we are going to try to 
get people their car as fast as we can.
 
Emmanuel Rosner 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Okay. So I understand the demand aspect, but 
I guess from a production 
capacity point of view you're saying that as of early 2016 you could 
theoretically have as many Xs as Model Ss being produced?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I mean, to sort of put our cards on the tabl
e here, I mean, we're 
setting factory capacity to be 1,000 Ss and 1,000 Xs per week. But actual 
production and capacity are not exactly the same thing, so there's always 
some percentage lower than the capacity that is 

 
or, like, occasionally it 
may hit ca
pacity, but it's hard to maintain capacity. But our goal is 

 
what 
our internal plan is, I can tell you, is that we want the factory to be able to 
make up to 1,000 Xs, up to 1,000 Ss per week next year and in terms of 
capacity. And then actual production i
s affected by real world issues, so 
there will be maybe some weeks where there is 2,000 produced and some 
weeks where there's very few produced because we've got factory tooling 
situations, hence the 1,600 to 1,800 average over the year that we're 
predicti
ng.
 
Emmanuel Rosner

CLSA Americas LLC
 
Okay, thanks.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

It would be fair to say the goal of the factory is to not just produce cars but 
it's to produce cars with the right cost and the right quality.
 
Elo
n Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, yeah, particularly, I mean, once we hit steady state, we can certainly 
do that, but it's just difficult during the ramp phase. Yeah.
 
Emmanuel Rosner 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Okay. That's very clear. And th
en one question on China. So they're happy 
to see that your revised strategy is getting some traction. So what exactly 
are you doing differently there, I guess besides offering a home charger for 
the buyers of Model S? Are there any other things you're doi
ng differently in 
China and any lessons that you can learn from there in terms of applying 
that to other regions?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, China is 

 
does have a unique set of challenges. The 

 
for example, 
there's the who
le license plate question, to get a license plate to drive a car 
in a lot of the major Chinese cities is quite difficult, so whether you have the 
electric vehicle exemption in a given city or not makes a big difference 
because if you don't, then people can
 
buy the car but they can't drive it. So 
we've been 

 
it has taken awhile but we've been successfully in getting EV 
plate exemption everywhere except Beijing, and we're optimistic about 
Beijing. We're seeing Beijing exemption in the future, hopefully in th
e near 
future. So that's important for China, but not something that one can extend 
to other parts of the world.
 
I think the 

 
yeah, I mean, it's 

 
I think it's really just that in China and in 
most countries that there is a bit of a slow build of awarenes
s and 
confidence in Tesla. And depending upon when we went to market in a 
particular country, that feeling is going to be at a low or a high stage of 
maturity. In the U.S., say, particularly California, it's a high stage of 
maturity. The awareness and comf
ort with Tesla in California is very high 
and that's sort of at a moderate stage of maturity in, say, the northeast of 
the United States and still at the low stage in most of Asia. And the same 
has been true in Europe.
 
Basically, it seems like with every c
ountry you've got to build confidence in 
the brand over time and it just takes time. You can't just have it be 
immediate. And just because people love it in California does not mean they 
automatically love it in other places. You've got to build the confid
ence over 
time.

CLSA Americas LLC
 
Understood. And a final one just on the Gigafactory. Can you just give us an 
update on how things are going there in terms of the preparation and then 
there was also, I think, you've been mentioning a bunch of hands (43:35) 
throughout the months on potenti
ally wanting to add some space there, 
adding some capacity? Can you talk, I guess, more precisely in terms of 
where would you see capacity go beyond sort of like the initial stages?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I'll say a few 
words and maybe JB can weigh in. I mean, whatever 
engaging and speculative comments like this, I think it is important just to 
remember they are speculative and not a prediction that we would have to 
say with very high confidence. But what we have found is
, with the 
Gigafactory, that as we spent more and more time on it, we found we've 
been able to improve the space efficiency of the production and the overall 
efficiency by more than our initial expectations. So the net result is that we 
think in the same v
olume we can do potentially significantly more output. 
JB, do you want to elaborate on that?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, I think our plans are still on track and unchanged for the first phases 
of production to support Model 3 and t
o support the Tesla Energy business, 
but the ultimate production capability of the site is what we believe can go 
much higher than we maybe initially thought it could. And we do remain on 
track for construction at the site. We'll have first equipment being
 
installed 
at the end of this year and planning to start production on Tesla Energy 
products in Q1 2016.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
In Gigafactory, we're already in production...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

Vice President

Investor Relations
 
Fremont and Clarence (45:35).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, we're already in production with Tesla Energy products in Fremont but 
that production will transfer to the
 
Gigafactory next year.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
And expand and ramp significantly.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah.

CLSA Americas LLC
 
Perfect. Great to hear. Thank you very much.
 
Operator
 
T
hank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from the line of Brian 
Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Your 
questions, please.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Good. I've got two questions, one on Powerwall 

 
ex
cuse me 

 
Powerpack 
opportunity and another relating back to Model S, Model X. On the 
Powerpack, I want to get sort of a deeper understanding of where you see 
your competitive advantage? If I think about simplistically four levels of a 
stack in terms of th
e utility, Powerpack solution with the upper level being 
sort of the grids, software interface with the grid kind of tie in when it's 
needed, when it's not needed. Second layer, the battery management 
software and then at the hardware, the inverter and oth
er power electronics, 
followed by the battery itself. Where do you see your advantage to each of 
those levels? How is it important to play at all of those levels and how do 
you interface with some of the existing middle people you might call them or 
consul
tants in the industry or other software providers who might be 
providing elements of the stack already?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Well, so it's a pretty detailed question. I think one of the maybe at a high 
level, one of the 
biggest benefits that we offer and where we have a 
competitive strength is having a system that solves pretty much all of those 
problems together. I think a lot of other people aspiring to be in this market 
sell one piece among that entire stack as you're 
calling it, and then you'd 
have to go to different companies to find the other pieces. At Tesla, we're 
integrating all of those pieces together for a very turnkey solution, that 
utility or commercial customer can just install.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & 
Chief Executive Officer
 
Basically plug and play matters even if you're at the megawatt scale.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, exactly. And I think, of course, the pricing fundamentals, starting with 
the battery itself, are really the f
oundation of that, but we have a lot of 
expertise and a lot of knowhow in power electronics and software as well 
that we've built on the car side of the business for many years.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
And how about the software, the 
interface with the grid and determine when 
to charge when, when to discharge?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, that's something we're working on now, and we're also working in 
partnership with many different utilities on this. There's n
ot a, perhaps, a 
universal point of view on exactly where that control and sort of dispatch 
should live, a lot of utilities want to be very involved in that themselves. So, 
we're basically setting up the tools and the infrastructure so that they can 
contro
l in a way that's familiar and the most convenient for them.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's effectively like an API...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
...s
o that the utilities systems can essentially call 

 
can put or call power to 
the pack, and then they can query the pack for information about its status. 
But, as JB was saying, like, it does have to interface with quite a 
heterogeneous set of systems aroun
d the world, so that's why you have to 
have basically an API interface to the pack saying 

 
so that the utility 
system can request power or put power to the pack.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, and maybe just one more comment. At the 
commercial level, that is 
something that Tesla is engaged in much more directly for things like 
demand management and those type of applications, but it's a bit of a 
different answer depending on which market we're in here.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays 
Capital, Inc.
 
And sort of how are you getting the utilities comfort with the cycle, number 
of cycles, and the lifetime of this? Are they sort of taking your word for it or 
is that something they're seeking to explore through pilots and/or their own 
high in
tensity testing of your battery packs?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Well, we have a lot of data, actually. It's not 

 
they don't just have to take 
our word for it. A lot of these tests have been running for a long time and we 
can show the
m fairly hard cycle data and some lifetime data, so that's been 
very helpful. And also, of course, there's all the sort of field experience from 
the automotive fleet. That is much bigger than what we're deploying in the 
stationary fleet and will remain so 
for a number of years. So having the 
confidence there and how those batteries have aged and done quite well is 
extremely helpful in building confidence.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Got it. And just final quick question, Model S, you noted
 
some risks to 4Q 
depending on what happens with the X ramp
-
up. Earlier in the year, you 
talked about a 30% gross margin for the Model S part of 4Q, of course that 
was not for 4Q overall, where do you stand on that 30% internal goal now?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chi
ef Financial Officer
 
Yeah, that 30% goal was before the dollar began to really strengthen at this 
level. So clearly that has had a fairly large impact on it. And also the mix has 
had some impact. Our focus also in the last few quarters has been much 
more s
o on Model X. There are various other cost reduction opportunities 
that we have that we are hoping to get in Q4 but they could potentially get 
delayed into Q1. We want to make sure they happen right and we are, at the 
same time, focusing on X. So I would s
ay broadly, if we put aside exchange, 
we see a trend of improving gross margin, despite mix over time.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. But no longer a hard 30% in 4Q?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
No, not in 

 
not next quarter, basically. But next year, contingent on 
macroeconomic conditions not going whacky, that seems like potentially an 
attainable number.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, sir. Next question comes 
from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. 
Please go ahead. Your question, please.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can I just follow up on some of the 
numbers you threw out on stationary storage 

 
the $1 billion
, is that orders 
or reservations? I just want to get a sense of how firm that was? And did 
you imply that because it sounds like $400 million to $500 million for next 
year? And then is it a few billion dollars for 2017 is the storage market, is 
that what y
ou said?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. These are reservations, so you can 

 
reservation may be in order or 
maybe not, but that's certainly what people have said that they want. Yeah, 
so there's over 100,000 reservations that ha
ve been placed for Powerwall 
and Powerpack. And of that, you can sort of speculate as to how many 
Powerwalls, how many Powerpacks per reservation. It's likely to be more 
than one, particularly in the Powerpack case. So, yeah, that's what leads us 
to think 
$40 million to $50 million, Q4, maybe 10x that number next year. 
And then 5x to 10x that number in 2017. But as I said earlier, as we get 
further away in time, the numbers are more speculative. Yeah.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
And where woul
d that put you in terms of market share and storage at that 
point, would it be most of the market for (54:14) stationary storage in 
2017?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We don't really know.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Offi
cer
 
Well, I mean, the market is definitely growing very quickly so it's a real hard 
(54:25).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, exactly.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
I'd say we're speculating on what the actual ent
ire market is going to do and 
how that's going to grow. So that's 
-
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I don't think you can draw a lot of conclusions from, like, what is the 
market.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Exactly.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
How much of the stationary storage was sold last year? Just as at the 
beginning of electric car production for Tesla, people were trying to say, 
""well, how many electric cars have been sold? Were sold l
ast year? Oh, 
almost none. Therefore, Tesla will sell almost none.""
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
That's to summarize what the vast majority of predictions were about for 
Model S.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, the prices that stationary storage was selling at last year, for instance, 
are so much higher than where they would be or will be in 2017, that you 
can't extrapolate those two.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, the amount for stationary storage increases at a sort of quite an 
extreme exponential as the cost of (55:27) decreases. The utilities used to 
think of, like, things in terms of levelized cost of energy, and dependi
ng 
upon where you are in the world, that number in some places is very high, 
some places quite low, but as you start to approach the average value, the 
demand basically scales into the multi terawatt
-
hour range. So...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief 
Technology Officer
 
Yeah, I mean, grid parity is kind of the wrong concept here, but it's maybe 
somewhat of an analogy to think about.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Grid parity, the market is staggeringly gigantic.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Right.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
And what is your all
-
in cost? I know it's $250 million for the Powerpack. I 
mean, with installation or anything? Do you have any estimate of what it 
actually costs like a commerci
al or utility, all
-
in?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Well, it depends a lot on the scope and scale and how many other pieces of 
that installation are bundled together, so we haven't quoted or listed those 
numbers since they vary so much fr
om one installation to the next. The 
battery cost is really what matters most in the economics so that's where 
we've listed those prices.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
I mean any sense of the high
-
end, low
-
end range for an installation?
 
Jeffrey
 
B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Nothing that we'd be ready to share quite yet.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. And just last question, how should we think about the margin profile 
over the next few years as this ramps? I believe you
 
said Q4 would be pretty 
low. Should that meaningfully improve and when do you kind of get parity 
with your gross margin on the auto side?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We are getting quite speculative about the battery business, but
 

 
what's 
that? I can't read your writing. Oh, 15%? Yeah, I think 

 
yeah, I mean, in 
the early days, the battery gross margins that are on the order of 15%, over 
time that could rise to 25% or maybe 30%. But we just don't know that 
quite yet. And we'd have
 
to look at what the price elasticity of demand is to 
understand where should we be pricing and what's the right gross margin to 
hit for.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. All right, thank you very much.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, sir. Our next ques
tion in queue comes from Ben Kallo with 
Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Ben J. Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. As far as the Model X goes, last time, 
Elon, you talked about 
configuration in July and I understand with the 
slippage. But when can we start thinking about configuring cars 

 
we have 
orders out there? Customer have orders. And then with about a month away 
from deliveries, when do you expect to show it to people?
 
Elo
n Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We're probably into upper configuration and two or three weeks of the X. So 
that should go live on the website before the end of August. In terms of the 
initial deliveries of the X, that's sort of consisten
t with what we predicted on 
the last call, which is end of September.
 
Ben J. Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay. And then as we look out to the target of 500,000 cars in 2020 and 
some of the things that you've learned recently, do you still 
stand behind 
that number and what gives you confidence in looking ahead to that number 
and ramping up production?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. I do remain confident about half a million cars in 2020, and maybe 
being able to ex
ceed that. It's worth noting that, so 2020, that's five years 
from now. If you go five years in the past for Tesla, we were producing 600 
cars per year. Now we can produce 600 cars in three days. So I think going 
from here to 500,000 cars a year is a much 
smaller leap than what we did 
over the past five years.
 
Ben J. Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Got it. And then when we think about your currency exposure, are you guys 

 
where are you guys at on thinking about moving kind of manufacturing 
out
side of the U.S. or any parts of manufacturing or additional 
manufacturing?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, it depends on what timeframe. In the next few years, we expect to be 
focused on Fremont and the Gigafactory in Nevada. Lo
ng
-
term, again, we're 
getting very speculative here, but in the three to five
-
year timeframe, it's 
going to make sense for us to think about localizing production in different 
markets, having a factory in Asia, a factory in Europe, other factories in 
North
 
America. So in order to go beyond the 500,000 units a year, that's 
what we would need to do. So our Tesla factory in Fremont and in near Reno 
is, that's sort of the size for the 500,000 level, might be able to do it a lot 
more than that, but say 500,000 s
hould be very achievable. The NUMMI 
impact, when it was operating as NUMMI, it did roughly half a million 
vehicles a year. So for us to do a similar number is just quite reasonable, I 
think, without adding new factories. So the new factories would be will 
going 
past $500,000.
 
Ben J. Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
And my final question, headline after this call might be Tesla is going to raise 
capital, just from your comments I think that some people are going to walk 
away thinking that and I j
ust want to make sure that you guys can set the 
record straight if that's in the cards in the near
-
term or if it's not. Thanks, 
guys.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We can't comment on that specifically, so. All right, next question.
 
Operator
 
Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea James with 
Dougherty & Co. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. What have you learned or discovered 
between the t
ime when you set that 55,000 unit goal and I guess, now when 
you're saying it's better to have some more breathing room on the ramp? 
And also, I guess one more, just along with that, is there any supplier in 
particular that's concerning you?
 
Elon Reeve Mus
k 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I don't want to sort of name specific suppliers, but our biggest challenges 
are with the second row seat, which is, it's an amazing seat, like a sculptural 
work of art, but a very tricky thing to get right. The falcon
-
wing door 
actually seems to probably not be a critical path item. There are some 
interior components, interior trim that are possibly on a critical path. But it's 
always hard to say exactly what lies in a critical path because it tends 

 
these things tend
 
to play schedule leapfrog and it's kind of a set of 
constraints that one day is this constraint, then the next day it's another 
constraint.
 
The pace of progress is really dependent on which supplier is the slowest 
and least lucky. So, if a supplier has un
expected challenges which can range 
from force majeure to simply having to redo a design because the initial 
design was wrong. But when you have a complex product like the Model S 
with thousands of 

 
that's dependent on thousands of suppliers, you can say 
that the pace of progress is determined by the thousand least lucky and 
slowest. But if we knew in advance which one of those would be, we would 
take action. So the 

 
yeah, it's 
-
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
No, that's helpful. I think everybo
dy understands that an investment in Tesla 
is a company that's learning as it goes along, so it's always interesting to 
see what you're discovering as you attempt to build. The other thing, can 
you walk us through what you accomplished during the factory s
hutdown in 
the quarter? It looks like you really did a lot of work in one week. Can you 
help us understand the significance and then also maybe paint it in terms of 
what you're doing in the factory this year that's going to actually be 
repurposed or can ev
en be used toward Model 3 production?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. So the retooling was both for the X as well as for improved efficiency 
of S production. And I think we've got a lot accomplished there. For Model 3, 
the bigges
t single item is the paint shop. So the paint shop is sized to be 
able to do 10,000 cars a week. So we've laid the foundations for that rate in 
the paint shop. And I think that there's also room for significant increases in 
our foundry in terms of casting.
 
And we've also made a significant 
investment in stamping and some sort of advanced metal sheet forming 
technology that isn't stamping.
 
Anything you want to add to that?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
I think in plastics paint, especially 
paint, we made modifications there on the 
existing paint shop while we're getting the new one ready. I think we 
essentially added capacity in many different shops in 

 
ahead of Model X. 
This required some production interruption to do it right, including g
etting 
our production control and inventory management processes much better. 
And we just can't do that when production is running.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
What about the drive unit, investments in the drive unit manufacturing? Is 
any of t
hat small drive unit going to be used for Model 3 or 
-
? It seems like 
you're really scaling up there.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We've certainly learned a great deal going from the original Model S drive 
unit to the small drive un
it 

 
what's called the small drive unit. It's 
dramatically easier to build, it's much more automated. That said, I think we 
will do a further revision for the Model 3 and essentially go to the third
-
generation production technology for the Model 3.
 
Jeffrey
 
B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, maybe one thing to keep in mind is the small drive unit capacity is 
quite in excess, even of vehicles, because of all
-
wheel drive. And as that has 
ticked up, we've increased the capacity of the small drive unit
 
in production 
that you see as well.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Because you need two of them.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel

Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Andrea Susan James

Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
And then finally, I guess, Deepak, I'd love for you to
 
stay as long as possible 
but I'll just ask this anyway. What's the status of your CFO search?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We're interviewing candidates all of the time. Deepak is part of the interview 
process. And, yeah, I think w
e are talking to some interesting candidates. 
I'm not sure if there's anything more to say about that.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
No, I mean, no, clearly I'll stay around to ensure there's a smooth transition. 
And we're continuing to talk to lo
ts of candidates and make sure we find the 
right person to come in.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Thank you. Actually, do you have any progress on regional heads of 
sales? And then that's my last one. Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & C
hief Executive Officer
 
Oh, well, yeah, we do have a regional head of sales for Asia who came to us 
from EMC and then there was some press about a head of North American 
sales who came from Burberry. And then just because we have, like, one 
person from Burb
erry, then people think we're copying Apple, which is 
ridiculous. He's great, but he's just one guy. And then we're continuing to 
search for our head of Europe sales.

George Galliers

Evercore ISI
 
Good afternoon and thank you for takin
g my question. I have a strategic 
question for you. It looks like in the next two years, we'll see (70:30) new 
and improved electric vehicles from your peers ranging from mainstream 
models from (70:36) to more premium vehicles from Audi and Porsche. 
Strate
gically, how do you think about the future electric vehicles from other 
ODMs; A, do you view them as a (70:48) EV market; B, do you view them 
as contributors to the common cause, raising awareness of EVs, overall 
consumer EV adoption (70:56) the EV market 
size; or C, given certain 
compromises of the competitors' efforts to
-
date, do you actually see them as 
the opposite, i.e., they form negative prejudice in consumers' minds with 
respect to electric vehicles, costs, practicalities and performance?
 
Elon 
Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I think this is the first multiple choice I've gotten as a question. But I think if 
you just look at our comments in the past, what we've said is like we're 
really excited to see other car companies do 
electric vehicle programs. 
What's been done to
-
date is not much.
 
They've generally been fairly small programs and often just set to achieve a 
regulatory minimum. So that hasn't been great thus far, but I'm encouraged 
by what I see about the future plans, t
hey sound like they're headed in the 
right direction and I would be super happy to see the whole industry to go 
electric. And we have open sourced our patent to 

 
so those wouldn't be an 
impediment. And perhaps it could be helpful. And, yeah, I'd be 

 
it'd
 
be 
really great if the whole industry would just go electric as soon as possible. 
In fact 

 
I mean our view is that the whole view will go electric eventually, 
they really won't have much choice, but the sooner they go electric the 
better.

8/4/17,Tesla,"I just wanted to note that we've made two fairly significant hires, the first 
which is Jason Wheeler. He will be our CFO starting next month. Deepak and 
Jason will be working closely together for the first few months to have a 
smooth 
transition. And, once again, I'd like to thank Deepak for his 
awesome contribution to Tesla.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Thank you, Elon.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So Jason comes to us from Google, where he was 
basically the number two 
finance guy at Google, responsible for their global finance function, and just 
thought he was a super smart guy and really understood what we were 
doing and was like a very cultural fit with the company. So I think that's 
going to 
be great.
 
And then, in addition, Jon McNeill has joined as Head of Global Sales and 
Service. And Jon is the former CEO of Enservio. He's been named sort of 
Most Admired CEO in the small and midsize company category. In fact, I 
believe this is the first tim
e in maybe a decade or more that Jon actually has 
not been head of the company that he's working at. So 

 
and before 
Enservio, he co
-
founded Sterling Collision, where he was able to reduce 
industry repair times by 90%, so the average repair time went from 
18 days 
to less than 2 days while growing the business at 40% year. So, I think Jon's 
an awesome addition to the team as well. And he's actually 

 
he's been 
doing great. He's been working now part
-
time at Tesla for a few months and 
just started full
-
time a
nd has already done a lot of good.
 
So I'm pretty excited about those two people joining the team, and we 
expect to have some additional announcements in the months to come as 
we add bench strength to the Tesla management team.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is 
now open.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. In the press release you seemed 
to address this a little bit, but there has been a lot of chatter about 
cancellations for orders for the X, and I think the press release says (4:28) 
Signature S
eries. Is that across models, and how should we think about the 
different versions of the X rolling out over the next couple quarters?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Do you want to talk about that?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Offic
er
 
I don't think there's been anything fundamentally different. I mean so far on 
the Signature Series Model X, we've seen a much higher conversion rate 
than when we had seen on the (4:52) when we launched S. So overall, the 
demand for the X after the launc
h of the X has been higher. So we don't see 
any fundamental issues.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I mean, we're 

 
as we talked about before, really, the main thing with 
the X is just scaling up production. We're making steady p
rogress with each 
passing week. Actually, seven days a week, every day, I get an update on 
manufacturing progress and what the issues are. And we see no 
fundamental issues on the production ramp. It's just a question of how 
quickly we can solve each issue.
 
I mean they are really down to like the little 
things, like the placement of the seal on the door and whether that results in 
the bright trim alignment being correct, this is quite nuanced. So we feel 
very confident of being able to get to several hundred
 
vehicles per week by 
the end of the year.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. And can you give an update on stationary storage? Is that still 
trending to your targeted $3 billion to $5 billion (6:02) by 2017? And I think 
the release mentioned 
that there are some institutional orders. I mean are 
there any noteworthy orders that you'd want to call out on the storage side 
that we should kind of look at as being big drivers? And are you still 
confident in your sort of 15% gross margin for that?
 
Elo
n Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sorry, that was like a whole bunch of questions. The 

 
with respect to 
stationary storage, I mean, that is again sort of a production
-
limited thing, 
so we're trying to scale our production as much as possib
le. I mean, we've, 
by almost any metric 

 
if we imagine the most we could possibly make in 
2016, we've already sold out of that, or at least if you were to take even a 
small fraction of the number of people that have placed orders, and I 
assume that those 
orders are valid, even if a small portion of those are valid, 
we would be sold out of all of 2016 production, I mean, well into 2017. So 
it's really mostly about predicting our production rate, and we expect very 
dramatic increases in the stationary storag
e production.
 
The reason I feel a bit cautious about giving exact estimates is that when 
you have an exponential increase, the exact calendar window over which the 

 
that you place that 

 
that exponential has quite a big impact on the 
numbers. So 

 
and, in
 
fact, in general, at Tesla, I want to be a little more 
cautious about giving quarterly numbers, particularly when we have very 
dramatic ramps. Like the example is with the Model X: you can imagine if 
you have strict calendar windows, and you place them ov
er the beginning of 
an exponential or slightly to the right or slightly more to the right, the actual 
differences are quite dramatic. So, like you know where it's going to end up, 
but not what it looks like in that rapidly changing S
-
curve situation. Yeah,
 
so.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
And on the margin side, is it still on target? And thank you very much for 
taking my questions.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sorry, on the 

 
you're breaking up a little bit 

 
on the 
margin side?
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
The gross margin, is it still at your 

 
is it still trending to the 15% target I 
think you mentioned on the last call?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Oh, 15%, yeah. Yeah, I don't 
think it's going to be any problem meeting a 
15% margin target. Obviously, the margin improves as the production 
ramps up, so, yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, I don't know if we want to discuss the specific margin targets, but it
 
should be in excess of 15%. That is our internal target.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I mean 

 
yeah. Once you get away from the very early stage of 
production, I think long
-
term margin, 15%, is no problem.

Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Your 
line is now open.
 
Jamie Alber

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question, and good afternoon. Just a point of 
clarification. First, on the announcement of the 40,000 vehicles that you've 
rolled the Autopilot feature out to over the air. Can you just clarif
y, once it's 
rolled out over the air, is there then a point at which the consumer has to 
determine to spend, I think it's $2,500, to activate it? And is there any detail 
you can provide us on those that are paying to activate the Autopilot feature 
at this 
time?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Most people who order the car actually order it with the Autopilot 
convenience features, so the Autopilot safety features are default on in all 
vehicles, this is automatic emergency braking, side c
ollision avoidance, 
forward collision warning, that kind of thing. The convenience features like 
Autosteer, Autopark are $2,500, but most people had actually already 
ordered that. So those that haven't ordered it, can actually turn it on for 

 
it's actuall
y slightly more if you get it after the fact 

 
turn it on for $3,000, 
and that's something that we'll be allowing people to do at some point in the 
coming months. Sort of like an in
-
app purchase, I guess. Yeah.
 
Jamie Albertine 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc
.
 
Okay. Great. And then I wanted to ask a question as it relates to, now that 
we're past sort of, as I understood it, the peak spending period in advance 
of the Model X launch, how should we think about capital expenditures and 
our cash flow models for the
 
fourth quarter? And maybe, it sounds like 
you've reiterated the positive free cash flow guide you had originally stated 
earlier this year, but just some thoughts as it relates to the cash flows in the 
fourth quarter would be great.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Fi
nancial Officer
 
Yeah, I mean, Q4, we are still in the peak of our Model X investments. A lot 
of our equipment and tooling is being paid off in Q4 as a production are 
proving out their production 

 
as our suppliers are proving out their 
production tooling, 
as well as the equipment is getting installed and getting 
signed off in our factory. So Q4 is going to be a peak for Model X. Clearly, 
2016, our CapEx should be less than 2015. And then we'll provide you 
further guidance on that in the next earnings call.
 
Jamie Albertine 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Much appreciated. And 

 
oh sorry, go ahead.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sorry, I was going to say, like, we do have like a very strong push towards 
free cash flow. I mean, that is 

 
ou
r aspiration is to be positive 

 
I do 
emphasize, this is an aspiration, not a promise, but our aspiration is to be 
positive cash flow in Q1.
 
Jamie Albertine

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.

And we look 
forward to meeting Jason when he's fully ramped and onboard.

Your line is now open.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks, everybody. Elon, just thinking longer term here, assuming Tesla 
establishes itself as a leader in autonomous transport, do you see a business 
case for selling autono
mous cars to ride
-
sharing firms, or can Tesla cut out 
the middleman and offer on
-
demand electric mobility services directly from 
the company's own platform?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

I think we'd have to say, no comment.
 
Adam Mic
hael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
I mean, Elon, it's kind of unusual for you to punt on strategic questions of a 
long
-
term nature. Is this a dumb question? Or a funny question?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Actually, I think it's
 
quite a smart question, actually.

Elon Reeve Musk

You know...
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Is it because of a 
competitive sensitivity, or is it because the concept itself is 
just too... in flux?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

I think there's a right time to make announcements. And this is not that 
time.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & C
o. LLC
 
Fair play. All right, can I ask one on Autopilot?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And nor 

 
I mean, nor is our strategy fully baked here. So for us to state 
what it would be 

 
it's not fully baked, so there's no 

 
we'd 
prefer to 
announce something when we think we've got the full story understood.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

all right, let's go to JB real quick, then. Autopilot, can 
you share any ea

Well, I don't think we want to share any particular details on specifics 
around user feedback on that, but certainly people are using it in a variety of

utopilot enabled cars, 
and those are racking up miles extremely quickly. At this point, I don't have 
the exact number at the tip of my tongue, but it's, I believe, several hundred 
thousand miles of driving. So...

ral (15:29) million a day, I think.

It's almost a million a day of cars that have Autopilot hardware. So, I mean, 
but the early data 

 
this is early data I'll emphasize, is that it's very positive. 
So we
're aware of many accidents that were prevented from Autopilot, and 
we're not aware of any that were caused by Autopilot. But this is still early, 
but it's a good indication. So it appears to be quite beneficial from a safety 
standpoint, and I believe some
 
of our customers have posted videos to this 
fact.

Our next

Joseph R. Spak

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks, good afternoon. I guess it's been awhile since we heard anything 
about this, but I just wanted to get a better sen
se of how you feel you're set 
up to deal with potential issues on the hardware side where fix can't be 
OTA'd (17:12) to the vehicle both 

 
because when you look at the coverage 
at least in the U.S. the ratio of service centers to stores and galleries is st
ill 
trailing a little bit. So how does that build outlook going forward and how 
would you potentially handle a hardware situation at this point?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I'm not sure I fully understand your question. So you 
mean 

 
can you give 
me an example of...?
 
Joseph R. Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
If you had a hardware recall 
-
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Oh, Just like 

 
you mean like 

 
sure. I mean, we've handled recalls in the 
past with our s
ervice team. It's gone quite well. In general, we try to be 
proactive, so if we without 

 
well before we've sort of forced to do a recall, 
we proactively try to fix things in the cars that we think might in the future 
be an issue. And the customer happines
s is as measured by really the key 
question that I think people should be concerned about, which is will your 
next car be a Tesla, that's like the key question on Consumer Reports. 97% 
of respondents said that their next car would be a Tesla. Frankly, this
 
is the 
only question people should care about.
 
Joseph R. Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. And then 

 
thanks for that. One more, I guess, sort of hardware 
question. As it relates to Autopilot where this is clearly stage one and you 
could add sensors ov
er time and maybe some new features as well, so how 
do you think about managing the brand and the vehicles when that 
happens? Because as the sensor suite changes, it can create two potentially 
different experiences when 

 
and I guess it's a little bit more
 

 
the reason I 
think it's a little bit more of an issue for Tesla is just you don't have the 
strict sort of model year nomenclature. So I guess I just wondered how you 
think about that and maybe some thoughts on your current sensor suite and 
how you see t
hat evolving as well.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Okay, I think that's a pretty open
-
ended questions, but 

 
we have a 
philosophy of just continuous improvements, so every week there are 
approximately 20 engineering changes made to 
the car. So it's not nearly as 
discrete as you're alluding to. With other manufacturers, they tend to sort of 
bundle everything together in a model year. In our case, it's a series of 
rolling changes. So model year doesn't mean as much. There are cases 
whe
re that step change may be a little higher than normal as, for example, 
with having the Autopilot camera, radar, and ultrasonics. But we try to 
actually keep those step changes as small as possible. And so that 

 
I mean, 
essentially like the common questio
ns that I get is from friends, they say, 
""when should I by a Model S?"" and my answer's always ""right now,"" because 

 
and they say, ""well, aren't you going to make a better one in six months?"" 
I'm like, yeah, of course. But if their goal is to only buy a Mo
del S when 
there aren't significant improvements happening, then they will never buy 
one.

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay. Yeah, great. Thank you. Good evening. A couple questions. Just one 
on the battery side. I think a lot of us were surprised at the GM Analyst Day. 
They put a
 
slide up which said that they were working on a battery that was 
$145 a kilowatt hour. That probably didn't include the pack costs, but even 
adjusting for that, that seemed like a pretty low number. And I don't know, 
maybe JB, how did you guys react to th
at presentation? Is it realistic? I 
mean, are you worried about the threat of a large form factor battery being 
the same cost as yours within kind of a one to two
-
year timeframe would be 
my first question.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Wel
l, we definitely read the report. And we're not terribly concerned about it. 
I think, also, there was a lot of confusion in that particular report and some 
of the comments following about cell price versus pack cost. And in general, 
we're quite comfortable
 
in our position with the type of cells and the form 
factors we're using, and we think that's going to be the best cost positioning 
and cost roadmap in the future.

And so

Elon Reeve Musk

Yeah, probably high probability (22:13). I mean we're constantly agonizing

even close to us. If they are, I would be the first to congratulate them.
 
Patrick K. Archa

Got it. Well, that's very helpful and quite reassuring to know. My second 
question just was on in the press release you talked about orders having 
increased 50% year

on

year, and maybe just a little color on that. I mean, 
that'
s obviously impressive, given the model that's been out there for a few

driven by?
 
Deepak Ahuja

We haven't provided that in the past. I think, maybe the w

Europe and APAC were really strong. And...
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And so was North America.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
And North America. North America has always been strong, and with 
Europe 
and APAC being strong, too, we were at 50% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Maybe, quite frankly, you can look at it the other way around, like, I think 
we were actually relatively weak in APAC and relatively weak
 
in most 
countries in Europe...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Deepak Ahuja

Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman &

...by ensuring that we've got a good supercharger infrastructure, a good 
service center infrastructure, that any perceptions about the company are 
addressed. And in a lot of places, it takes time to build consumer confidence, 
they n
eed to hear the 

 
they need to hear about Tesla a lot before they're 
comfortable making a significant asset purchase. So 
-
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, it's a matter of the execution by the team, brand awareness and our 
expansion of our glo
bal network.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Yeah.
 
Patrick K. 
Archambault

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Got it. Helpful. If I can squeeze one last one in really quickly, on the topic of 
Autopilot, there were some reports of the car like taking accidents (24:31) 
and stuff when it wasn't told to and things like that, and I don
't 

 
I just 
didn't know if there was much validity in any of that stuff. I mean, have you 
guys 

 
are any of these things true? Because, I mean, you sound very 
confident about the technology, yet, initially, there were some reports of 
errors and things like
 
that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I don't think it should be a surprise that there were reports of errors. I 
mean, we described it as a (24:59) beta release and a one 

 
and that the 
system will learn over time and get better. And 
that's exactly what it's 
doing. So I think it's exactly what we described is occurring. And the system 
is getting better with each passing week. So I would expect that 

 
that 
learning to accelerate, and for it 

 
we're 

 
I think it will start to feel quite 
refined within a few months.

Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Ban
k. 
Your line is now open.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. Had a couple questions. First, on Model X, I just wanted to 
confirm. Did you say you thought you could get a few hundred produced and 
delivered by year end? And just 
so that we understand what's been 
happening here, is it just the seat at this point, or are there other unique 
challenges that you think prospectively affect the ramp of the vehicle?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
No, to be precise, I
 
said several hundred per week, that we expect to reach 
the production rate of several hundred per week next month.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And (26:28) predict the exact numbe
r that will be developed because what I 
was mentioning earlier, like, we're kind of on an exponential ramp. So 
exactly one week this way or that can actually make a significant number, a 
significant impact in the absolute number of vehicles delivered, we d
o feel 
comfortable at this point of reaching the several hundred per week 
production rate before the end of the year, i.e., next month.
 
And the issues are a bunch of little things. Door seals, right now, is a 
challenge, for example. The monopost seat in th
e second row is still a 
challenge, but less of a challenge. It's not the gating factor. This is basically 
going through a series of constraints. Most constraints can change from one 
day to the next. But the important point is that we don't see any 
fundamen
tal obstacle to achieving a production rate of several hundred per 
week sometime next month.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. And it sounds like the target that you laid out, the 1,600 to 1,800 
vehicles a week, it sounds like you might t
hink that that's achievable in early 
2016, and I wanted to confirm that. You didn't provide CapEx for next year, 
but also if you can just confirm, is that what you're sort of thinking you need 
to achieve that free cash flow break
-
even?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Ch
airman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I think it's likely that we could be in that 1,600 vehicles to 1,800 
vehicles range, per week range, in Q1. I mean, I'm guessing we'll probably 
be towards the lower
-
end of that range, but then maybe exceed that, the 
h
igh
-
end of that range, towards the end of next year if things go well. I 
mean, there are some caveats there, depends on what macroeconomic 
conditions are like around the world next year. But right now, we do see that 
1,600 vehicles to 1,800 vehicles per we
ek on average as occurring in Q1.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great. And just lastly, if I can slip one last one in, you ramped up your 
CapEx, presumably in part to achieve some increased targets for Tesla 
Energy. Could you just give us s
ome high
-
level thoughts on what you might 
be able to ramp up to for that business line, maybe in 2016?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Well, the CapEx requirements for Tesla Energy are not that significant as a 
percentage of the total for 20
16 (29:18).
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, and I think, just to sort of provide a broader perspective about the 
CapEx increase 

 
so for 

 
let's talk 2016. The CapEx in 2016 is primarily 
going to be for Model 3 and the Gigafactory as we're loo
king at 2016 and 
beyond. It's not necessarily for much of the capacity required in 2016. 
Clearly, there is a little bit of CapEx there for Tesla Energy, but that's not the 
driving factor. Much of that CapEx has been put in place by end of this year 
for our
 
needs next year.

Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. 
Your line is now open.
 
John J. Murphy

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Good afternoon
. Just a first question on in
-
sourcing, obviously, you guys are 
pulling the second row seats in
-
house for the Model X. And there's certainly 
been some acquisitions and work you've done on forging and casting. I'm 
just curious, as you look at production goi
ng forward for the Model X and 
even the Model 3, if there would be opportunity to in
-
source more parts to 
really kind of solve the issues you're facing with some of these suppliers. 
And as you think about that, how you make that decision around cost and 
ca
pital intensity? And if you get that right and can in
-
source more, if you 
could potentially increase the cadence of your product introductions and the 
product launches themselves?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes, I totally agree wi
th that. That's exactly, that's the reason 

 
we're only, 
actually, in the whole history of Tesla, only done one tiny acquisition. And 
that was for Riviera Tooling in Michigan. And we plan to use that as a hub to 
recruit top tool and die manufacturers, basi
cally tool and die engineers, to 
Tesla Michigan. And with that exact goal, which is, how do we reduce our 
critical path to 

 
our time to market for new products. Because we end up 
being constrained by, basically, tools and molds. And anything we can do to 
tighten that timeframe organically was an (31:33) acquisition is a good 
thing. I mean, the crazy thing is that that $10 million or so that we spent 
acquiring Riviera was less than what we spent on expediting our stamping 
dies. So it's like a no
-
brainer. An
d we want to do that in general. We like 
looking at all of our critical path items and saying, ""okay, how do we execute 
faster on, and reduce the critical path for, new product introductions, 
obviously with an eye towards Model 3 and making sure that Model
 
3 
happens as soon as humanly possible?""
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
But is this significantly just around tool and die, or are there parts? Like I 
mean, where you could actually be doing all the seating internally or start 
doing 

 
think
ing about wiring harnesses or stuff that would be that intensive 
as far as in
-
sourcing?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We actually are 

 
we have substantially in
-
sourced the seats at this point. 
So Tesla is producing its own 
seats. Yeah. So that's actually something 
we've already done.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. And then, just a second question on the fourth quarter. You're talking 
about 17,000 units to 19,000 units being delivered. Is sort of the low
-
end 
and the high
-
end of the range really dependent on the ramp on Model X, and 
you sort of see 17,000 units at the low
-
end as sort of your base with your 
Model S? Just trying to understand the range and sort of how we should 
think about mix in the fourth 
quarter.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, the big variables are exactly in which week are we able to really spool 
up Model X production? A few weeks' improvement (33:29), one or the 
other, has quite a big impact on Model X product
ion. And then of course, we 
still have to get those cars delivered. So 

 
and at the end of the year, there 
can often be logistical challenges, because it's like Christmas and New 
Year's. And all of the logistics channels are jammed and people are not 
home.
 
And there can also be adverse weather events, like blizzards and 
things. So that's what 

 
it's sort of logistical challenges at the end of quarter 
and when exactly does the 

 
and what exactly does the Model X production 
ramp exponential look like, that's 
what introduces the uncertainty.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. So we shouldn't think of the 17,000 units as a sort of base level for 
Model S. There's a lot of variables that are going in here in addition to the 
Model X ramp, right?
 
E
lon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, end of quarter logistical challenges around Christmas always throws 

 
is a bit of a wild card.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Got you. Okay. And then just lastly real quick, with eve
rything that's going 
on with dieselgate, obviously your ZEV credits might be a lot more desired 
by a lot of folks out there. I know you guys are talking about no ZEV credits 
in the fourth quarter as far as the sales or, actually, at all, for sales or gross
 
profit, but, over time, is there an opportunity to maybe sell them at a much 
higher price as they become available? I know it's not a big part of the 
business, but it does seem like an opportunity to maybe in a short run to 
make a lot of money on some inc
reasing demand.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, it really depends on what happens with zero emission vehicle 
regulations over time. You'd think given dieselgate and all that that there 
should be a typing up of zero emission req
uirements, but we're not seeing 
that yet. Frankly, we do not think that the California Air Resources Board is 
being sufficiently stringent in this regard. I mean, if we can't sell ZEV 
credits, then it's obviously not 

 
the regulations are not strong enough
.

p you guys in that regard at all? I mean, are

Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, right now, we're actually ve
ry happy with the quality of the drive 
units. I mean, internally, our goal 

 
we changed the goal of the drive unit 
endurance from being approximately 200,000 miles to being 1 million miles. 
Just basically we want drive units that just never wear out. That'
s our goal. 
And I think we've made really good progress in that direction. So the drive 
units going out now and for the last several months have been excellent. 
So...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, we should probably note that, I mean
, we've also made improvements 
to the large drive unit and those issues were really limited to early 
population large drive units. So today we hold the same standard on both 
units that are being built.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Y
eah, exactly. There was like this one period of time where we had, I mean, 
it was like that was getting into the weeds, like we transitioned from 
manual, just before we transitioned to automatic grease injection into the 
spline of the large drive unit, we 
had variation in how much grease was put 
into the spline. And if not enough grease was put into the spline, it would 
have premature wear. That's, like, one example. But other than that, the 
large drive units have been great.

Thanks for taking my questions. A year ago, you guys had been targeting 28 
to 30% gross margins by around this time, but clearly the world 
changed on 
you with currencies and so forth. So what's the right way to think about 
gross margin over the next 18 months?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, our goal is to steadily improve gross margin and hopefully exceed 30% 
on th
e Model S and Model X vehicles within 18 months, hopefully sooner 
than that. But it is 

 
it does require quite an intense effort to 

 
for every 
fractional point of gross margin. So 

 
and that assumes current, there's not 
some radical shift in currencies th
at happens again. So the 

 
so if 

 
according to our plans, at least, we would exceed 30% gross margin within 
18 months on the S and X line.

It's a combination of various initiative company from material cost 
reductions, manufacturing, production efficiencies, and labor hours per unit 
reduction, combined with economies of scale that, as our volume goes up, 
our cost allocation is
 
more efficient, which brings our labor and overhead 
cost on a per unit basis down. So, clearly, as we act on all of those directions

Just one more? Okay. So I guess I'll just then take a step back. It seems like 
in the Silicon Valley centric worldview, Autopilot is where driving is going 
and all the c
ars are going to be driving themselves, but I'm 

 
I just really 
want to know, is that Tesla's view, and how central is Autopilot to your long
-
term revenue profit and vehicle electrification goals?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, 
I'm actually on record saying that I think that all cars will go fully 
autonomous in long
-
term. I think it will be quite unusual to see cars that 
don't have full autonomy, let's say, in 

 
before new car production in the 15
-
year to 20
-
year timeframe. And f
or Tesla, it will be a lot sooner than that. 
So I actually think at the point at which cars being made that have full 
autonomy 

 
that any cars that are being made that don't have full 
autonomy, will have negative value. It will be like owning a horse or no
t 

 
you're really owning it for sentimental reasons.

Hi. Good 
afternoon. I wanted to first ask, just put a finer point on the fourth 
quarter. So deliveries of 17,000 units to 19,000 units seems like not a huge 
contribution from Model X within this. How do you ramp up the Model S 
deliveries sequentially so fast? I mea
n, it doesn't look like in the 

 
I guess, 
in the Model S history, we've seen sort of like such a sequential increase in 
the 

 
in deliveries, like so what are you doing, I guess, better in this 
particular quarter?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executiv
e Officer
 
Well, it's not as big a leap as it might seem from Q4, Q3, because there's a 
whole week missing from Q3. And we continue to ramp the rate all the way 
from the beginning of Q3 through end of year for Model S. So it's actually 
not too much of a str
etch, or less than a stretch than it may seem. And 
something we've had much bigger sequential jumps before than this. This is 

 
it's worth noting that it's 2015. In 2010, Tesla was delivering 500 cars per 
year. We now deliver 500 cars in just over two days
.
 
Emmanuel Rosner 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Okay. That's helpful. And then just on, again, a finer point just on the Model 
X, for this particular quarter. It sounds like your 

 
have you actually started 
production? It actually sounds like you're still working ou
t some issues there, 
and what has essentially surprised you as you sort of like ramp this up, 
which is causing maybe the actual production in larger numbers to be maybe 
slightly later than it would have been?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Of
ficer
 
Yeah. I mean, the thing about a car is because there's several thousand 
unique components in a car, the production can only move as fast as the 
slowest component. So even though 99% of the Model X is ready for high 
production, less than 1% of the par
ts are not. But those are what drive the 
rate. So that's the thing that makes car 

 
vehicle production really, really 
challenging and vehicle ramp really challenging. And you don't 

 
you don't 
know in advance what those issues are going to be, or you would
 
do 
something about it. So that's 

 
yeah. And then, you can basically think of 
like the production will move as fast as the least lucky supplier that we have 
in our network. So, yeah the most 

 
and there are sort of fires, floods, 
issues of various kinds a
round the world. And, yeah, so several thousand 
parts and, in fact, if you go down to Tier 2 and Tier 3, several thousand 
suppliers, it moves as fast as the thousandth worst supplier.

Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe going back 
to the dieselgate issue again, but from a bigger picture perspective. I'm 
curious what impact you see to th
e electric vehicle market from these 
revelations at VW. Could it increase the demand for electric vehicles to your 
benefit? Does it maybe make non
-
electric vehicles more expensive to 
produce, to truly comply with emission regulations? Does that help the 
Mo
del 3 be more cost competitive? I'm just curious what impact you see 
overall to the industry, and then to Tesla specifically.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, this has really shined a spotlight on the whole emissions testing 
proce
ss. And it's now obvious to consumers that gasoline 

 
well, especially 
diesel, but also gasoline cars 

 
have real world emissions that are 
substantially greater than what's experienced in the test 

 
when they go 
through testing. And I think what one would 
naturally expect from this is 
that regulators will no longer turn a blind eye to these things. And so the 
cost of producing gasoline, diesel cars that actually meet the legal emissions 
requirements is going to be quite a bit higher. So I would expect the c
ar 
companies to accelerate their plans for electric vehicles, which is great. And 
there might be some near
-
term benefit to Tesla, but thus far, we haven't 
actually seen it, but there might be one.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay, great. And
 
then just last question. I understand that deliveries for the 
Model X initially are, clearly, a function of how many you can build, given 
your large backlog of orders, but in trying to estimate what demand might 
look like more medium
-
 
to long
-
term, is the
re anything more that you can 
say now, or that can be shared, about the pricing of the vehicle beyond 
Signature Series?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, just what I mentioned publicly, which is that we expect similarly 
equipped Mo
del X to be no more than $5,000 greater than the price of Model 
S.

Thanks so much. Can you talk a little b
it about the acceleration in the ramp 
of the Gigafactory? What are you seeing at this point, in terms of your ability 
to fully accelerate in 2016, and when do you think we might see cells coming 
out of the factory and into cars?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief
 
Technology Officer
 
Well, in particular, as we've mentioned, we've accelerated the production of 
Tesla Energy products at the Gigafactory, so that's what has started just 
recently there, and that was quite a bit ahead of plan. That's happening in a 
separat
e section of the factory from where the cells will be produced, but 
also, as we discussed, we do expect that cell production will start up the 
second half of next year, which is, again, a little bit ahead of plan. And some 
of those cells would initially be
 
allocated toward Tesla Energy products. And 
we still are targeting around 2017 for the first cell production that would be 
going into vehicles and into the Model 3. So that remains on target.

And then, just i
n terms of the dynamics around leasing, are you seeing any 
real meaningful changes in terms of overall lease take rates or a change in 
ownership kind of dynamics at this point?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
We are seeing a slight increase in the l
ease take rate in North America. And, 
as we indicated in the letter, that increase has been fully consumed or taken 
up by our bank leasing partners rather than Tesla direct leasing. So, whether 
we do resale value guarantee or leasing, from our perspective,
 
it's no 
different. And it's a consumer preference. So there's nothing deep or 
significant that we are seeing in that trend.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your 
line is now open.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barcla
ys Capital, Inc.
 
Yeah, kind of three quick questions, or two quick ones, one more 
philosophical. First, again on the 4Q, you talked about building up finished 
goods inventory. We don't have the final numbers yet, but for the last 
quarter, production outpac
ed deliveries and you're guiding to that for 4Q. So 
what's going to be different in terms of hitting that ramp up on deliveries for 
Model S in 4Q vis
-
à
-
vis drawing down that inventory?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
You're referring 

 
so for Model 
S?
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yeah, for Model S.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, as I indicated in the letter, we were carrying higher finish goods 
inventory that was in transit at the end of Q3 to support those higher 
deliveries in Q4. And it's the drawdown of that extra inventory that allows us 
to do that. Our ending inventory at Q4 is going to be no different than what 
we have had a few quarters back. So it's still a fairly good level to support all 
of our marketing a
nd sales and service activities. So, overall, the increase is 
demand
-
based and it's fully doable.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
And to...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I think I might answer the question more fully (5
3:00).
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, go ahead.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yeah, and to clarify, just the Model X pricing, is that based on range and 
features? Or is it just based on battery size, the $5,000 difference?
 
Dee
pak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
For a comparably equipped car with regular features.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. And so, equipped would mean battery or range or 
-
?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. So wi
th the same battery and the same number of seats and that kind 
of thing.
 
Brian Arthur Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. Yeah, and final question, and maybe this is one for Jason, Deepak, 
Elon conversation, if autos are a very capital
-
intensive busines
s, as much as 
you're pursuing a different model on the battery side, it looks like there's a 
lot of capital going into tooling and all these complicated mechanical things, 
not to mention service. As you kind of think forward three years, is that 
more or le
ss the way you're going to spend capital, or is there anything you 
could do to kind of be more asset
-
light in the process?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
I think stepping back maybe the better way to look at it is that, at Tesla, our 
CapEx spend fo
r what we are achieving, in my mind, has been really efficient 
in the industry.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And it's worth noting that Deepak spent a huge part of his career at Ford, so 
you have a good basis for comparison.
 
Deepak 
Ahuja 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Right. And as we look at every year, and as we add incremental capacity in 
the CapEx related to that, we are continuing to increase on that efficiency in 
terms of CapEx dollars per unit of production. So fully agree this is 
an asset
-
intensive business. And the key here in terms of return on investment is how 
efficient we are with that capital. And that's what we're focused on.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, absolutely. We certainly believe in capit
al efficiency and getting better 
with that over time. But we also believe that companies build value by doing 
hard things. Not outsourcing those hard things to other people, because 
then they deserve the value.
 
Deepak Ahuja

Brad Erickson

Pacific Crest Securities
 
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, consistent with a lot of your 
commentary, recently you called out in the shareholder, just wanting to 
emphasize quality on the Model X and it sounds like it's warranting a little bit 
slower ramp here in the near
-
term. With what you've gone through over the 
past few years in bringing th
is car to market, does this change your thinking 
at all over the longer term when you think the pace at which you'll bring 
Model 3 to market relative to longer term targets that are out there?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I th
ink we're still aiming to have Model 3 in about two years. So 

 
but, 
I think, the cadence of future products should improve as we have more 
resources to shorten the critical path on things like 

 
as mentioned earlier, 
like stamping tools and molding dies a
nd things that tend to drive our 
schedule. Because from the point at which the car is designed, it can take 
almost two years to get fully tooled up. That seems like a crazy amount of 
time to us, and we want to try to reduce that significantly.

Thanks. Elon, could you talk a little bit, as you guys

for the S going forward? And then could we talk a little bit about getting to 
20% or above gross margin on the X, what kind of volumes we need? And 
then third, 
can we touch on the energy storage industry? One thing that I 
hear a lot in the marketplace is it's a commodity business. JB, could you 
touch on that and anything you're seeing there? And, Elon, last time on the

or energy storage.

I don't think that people really gave you a lot of credit there, so could you 
just 
talk about what backs up those numbers?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, I think it's just basically if 

 
as we mature in various markets 
around the world, there's always the question of how long does it take to 
mature in these 
markets, some markets a lot harder to solve than others, 
and there's also macroeconomic conditions, will there be a recession or not, 
will there be when or will (58:17) there be a recession, and these (58:22) 
will obviously make a difference. But, I mean, 
I think in the long
-
term, 
there's probably close to $100,000 

 
sorry 100,000 vehicles a year of S 
demand, and maybe something comparable to 

 
for X, holding economic 
conditions constant and assuming full market maturation, which can take, 
like, quite a lon
g time in some markets.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
And maybe to your energy storage question, I mean, obviously, energy is a 
commodity market, but I don't think that in any way really changes the 
opportunity there. In some ways that's s
ort of what creates it.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It makes it bigger.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Exactly. It's what creates us the opportunity for us to ramp much faster. And 
we still see a lot of technical di
fferentiation amongst these different 
products, just because energy itself is a commodity doesn't mean that the 
ways that you create it are the same. And the storage technologies and how 
well they're integrated and how plug and play they are for customers 
to just 
use them to solve problems and do that very quickly is quite different 
amongst all the different people trying to address this.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I mean, if you can sell a dollar for 

 
I mean, basically if y
ou can 
provide a dollar's worth of value for $0.80 compared to your competitors', in 
a commodity business, that's amazing. That's like you want to be in a 
commodity business.

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Got it. And then on the margi
ns on the X volume?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I think they're going to be comparable to the Model S over time, but it 
is important to bear in mind that the S is a much more mature product, so 
we've been in 
production with the S for three years. I would expect the 
margins to be within a few points of one another over the long
-
term.

5/5/17,Tesla,"Thank you. First of all, I'd like to just thank the Tesla team for an incredible 
job this quarter. The execution was outstanding and 
--
 
on just about every 
front. So it's just an honor to work with such a great team.
 
Q3 was obviously a very strong 
quarter and we had record deliveries, we're 
able to make great strides and controlling our costs. We shifted back to 
GAAP profitability while also generating strong free cash flow. And again, 
this would not be possible without each employee doing their par
t to reduce 
cost. Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production 
started.
 
Regarding Gigafactory, Shanghai, this month we started with trial production 
at Giga Shanghai and built four vehicles from body, to paint, to general 
assembly
. So this is a 
--
 
more emphasis this is a real factory with a 
tremendous amount of equipment in it. While a lot of people see the outside 
show the factory, which is enormous, and it was essentially under water in 
January. It was below the water table liter
ally.
 
What is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massive 
stamping machines, fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general 
assembly line in the same period of time, in parallel with bogue building I'd 
like to thank our 
transient for this extraordinary achievement I'm not aware 
of any factory of this magnitude in history being constructed in such a short 
period of time, approximately 10 months.
 
As far as I know, this is unprecedented. And Gigafactory Shanghai will 
become 
a template for future growth. We're planning to build model
-
wise in 
Shanghai as well of course, and build a Gigafactory in Europe and we hope 
to announce the location to that Gigafactory. In fact, we will announce the 
location to that Gigafactory before th
e end of this year.
 
Regarding Model Y, we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in 
Fremont, and we've moved the launch timeline from full 2020 to summer 
2020. There may be some room for improvement there, but we're confident 
about summer 2020. 
I've actually recently driven the Model Y release 
candidate and think it's going to be an amazing product and be very well 
received. I think it's quite likely to 
--
 
just my opinion, but I think it will 
outsell Model S, Model X and Model 3 combined.
 
Regardi
ng the Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month we released our 
latest Software Version 10, which includes video streaming games karaoke, 
Spotify and a host of other new features and improvements. Most 
importantly, it includes the first version Smart Summon
, which has now 
been used 1 million times. So, it's now over 1 million uses of Smart 
Summon, and in the next week or so we will be releasing an improved 
version of Smart Summon taking into account all the data from those 1 
million Smart Summon attempts.
 
So
, this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet, because it 
allows us to collect these corner cases and learn from them, and use street 
learning and become rapidly better just as Navigator and Autopilot did on 
the freeway. So, expect a number
 
of improvements in Smart Summon in the 
weeks to come. And this is really just the beginning as we collect more data 
and Autopilot and Full Self
-
Driving functionality get better.
 
I do 
--
 
while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at
 
least 
in limited 
--
 
in early access release of a feature
-
complete Full Self
-
Driving 
feature this year. So, it's not for sure, but it appears to be on track for at 
least an early access release of a fully functional Full Self
-
Driving by the end 
of this yea
r.
 
And yeah, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a 
material difference to the company, such as opening Gigafactories in other 
continents. Yes, it's worth noting that these geared ultimately having three 
Gigafactories effectively will
 
triple out our output. And then when you 
consider increased output per Gigafactory, it's going to actually more than 
triple our output over time. And then, there are a lot of interesting things 
happening with respect to advanced batteries and more efficie
nt 
powertrains, and full self
-
driving and all that sort of stuff, but that will be 
something for a future time.
 
And then, one last item is that tomorrow afternoon, we will be releasing 
Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof. That's the integrated solar panels 
i
ntegrated with the roof. So that's 
--
 
I think this is a great product. Version 1 
and 2 where we're still sort of figuring things out. Version 3, I think, is finally 
ready for the big time. And so we're scaling up production of the Version 3 
solar tower roo
f at our buffalo Gigafactory. And I think this product is going 
to be incredible.
 
But we'll talk more about that on the official product launch, which will be 
tomorrow afternoon.

Thank you very much. And I think Zachary has some 
remarks as well.

Yeah, thank you, Elon. Thank you, Martin. Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla. 
I know many employees are listening right now, and I want to thank you for 
your passion and your hard work. We've made terrific progress, and yet 
again, we realized margin improvements in nearly every aspect of the 
business. There are three key points I would like to highlight.
 
First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided by improved gross profit, 
reduced operating expenses and the absence of ne
gative one
-
time items 
that weighed on our financials in the first half of the year. GAAP automotive 
gross margin improved sequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding 
regulatory credits.
 
We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on 
M
odel S, Model X and Model 3, enabling better fixed cost absorption. We 
realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as other costs such 
as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import related items. We are also 
making continued progress reducing
 
material costs, including commercial 
negotiations with suppliers.
 
Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related 
to free unlimited supercharging. And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly, driven 
by mix in Asia, pricing action in EMEA
. North American ASPs held flat as mix 
improved, offsetting pricing action we took at the start of the quarter, which 
is great to see. Note that with the release of Smart Summon in the US, we 
were able to recognize $30 million of deferred revenue. As we ex
pand Smart 
Summon to additional markets and release new features, we will continue to 
recognize additional deferred revenue.
 
Our services and other loss reduced yet again, reflecting our focus to 
improve efficiency of this area of the business, and we furt
her reduced 
operating expenses despite increased orders, deliveries and new programs in 
development. And finally, on net income and other income, we saw benefits 
from foreign exchange, which as I mentioned last quarter, we don't hedge.
 
The second key point
 
I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another 
quarter of strong free cash flows despite a significant increase in our captive 
leasing mix and a sequential increase in CapEx spend. This has enabled year 
to date positive free cash flows for the compan
y. Our cash balance increased 
by approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited 
the quarter with our highest quarter
-
ending cash balance ever of just over 
$5.3 billion.
 
Specifically, on captive leases, we've received a number of questi
ons on how 
these are funded. We use our leasing warehouse and ABS sales to allow for 
captive leases without material use of cash. What's important to note here is 
that our warehouse and ABS flow through financing cash flow, and as a 
result, leases negative
ly impact free cash flow. This impact was material in 
Q3 as the lease rate increased substantially by 50%.
 
In addition, CapEx spend increased, driven primarily by Gigafactory 
Shanghai and Model Y spending. We've received a number of questions on 
why our ca
pital spending appears low compared to prior levels, even though 
there are multiple new projects launching and in development. As we noted 
in the shareholder letter this quarter and last quarter, this is because we've 
made great progress on improving our c
apital efficiency.
 
My third and final point is around demand and growth. Our global order rate 
remains strong and continues to increase. Despite increases to production 
levels, our order backlog has been growing, and quarter to date orders are 
significantl
y higher than at this point in last quarter.
 
In the immediate term, we're focused on increasing production of Model 3 
and Model S and Model X as quickly as we can. The bulk of this work 
involves continued optimization of existing equipment. We've also made
 
targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand.
 
Our pace of execution on these factories and capacity expansion has 
increased significantly. As Elon mentioned, the first phase of Gigafactory 
Shanghai is already production
-
ready, and w
e've been able to pull in the 
timeline for other major projects. Overall, we are quickly turning the corner 
for our next phase of growth and our financial health continues to 
strengthen. We remain focused on reducing cost which enables rapid 
investments in
 
future programs and growth.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. And I think also our Director of Energy Operations 
Kunal Girotra wanted to have some remarks.
 
Kunal Girotra
 
Hi, everyone. My name is Kanal Girotra, and I've been with Tesla for about 
four 
years working on different aspects of deploying our energy products. I 
now run Tesla Energy's deployment and fulfillment teams. Over the last 
three months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our Solar 
and Energy Storage businesses.
 
As you ca
n see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost 
50% over last quarter, and our energy storage deployments, which include 
Powerwalls and Powerpacks, grew by 15% to an all
-
time high of 477 
megawatt hours. In the last three months, we relaun
ched Tesla Solar in 
North America by simplifying our solar offering into three sizes of small, 
medium and large with transfer and pricing on the website.
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually, if I may interject. What a lot of people don't realize is, in California 
and in a 
number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar subscription or 
solar rental, there's no money down, and you instantly save on your utility 
bill, and there's no long
-
term contract.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Right.
 
Elon Musk
 
So, it's kind of a no
-
brainer. It's 
really, do you want something that prints 
money? And if it doesn't print money, we'll fix it or take it back. It's kind of a 
no
-
brainer. And it sort of plays into Tesla's overarching strategy here which 
is effectively to become a giant distributor global u
tility...
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Musk
 
On the energy side.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, absolutely. The subscription solar offering that you mentioned has 
launched in six states, and like you said, it's six monthly payments and no 
long
-
term contracts, and th
e response from customers has been pretty 
awesome so far.
 
Elon Musk
 
Most people do actually buy it, as opposed to rent it, which actually is 
technically the better 
--
 
while you make money immediately if you rental, 
it's actually a better investment if you 
buy it, because the cost of capital of 
the consumer is better than our cost of capital.
 
And then, there's an interesting study by Zillow and a number of other 
organizations that show that adding solar to your home increases the price 
-
-
 
increases the value
 
of your home, and the Zillow study showed a 4% 
increase in the value of the home with solar.
 
And then, if you add sort of the Powerwall, which gives you blackout 
protection so you'll have energy security in the event of rolling blackouts or 
if the power g
oes out for any reason, which appears to be a long
-
term 
systemic issue in California particularly, that I think is definitely going to be 
viewed as a significant asset for any home.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Totally, yeah. Yeah, I think to your point of buying Tesl
a Solar is easy 
because we have one of the lowest prices in the nation now, in the country, 
and just a little bit of story there. We were able to lower our prices because 
our cost of acquisition is now less than a quarter of any typical solar 
company.
 
Elon
 
Musk
 
We don't do sales.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, we do online sales, online orders...
 
Elon Musk
 
There's no advertising, no marketing and no sales force. But would you 
rather pay for power or for marketing? I'd say, you would rather pay for the 
product.
 
Zach
ary Kirkhorn
 
Totally, yeah. Yeah. That's great. On solar, we've also simplified the 
fulfillment process with a goal of really fast order to install timelines. We've 
done many residential installs with a single related to a customers' home 
because of the 
reduced complexity. We've also been working with cities and 
counties to submit generic permits that follow a template rather than 
customizing for every situation, because...
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually, this is a really big deal. I want people to appreciate the gre
at work 
by you and the energy team to get this done, because one of the inhibitors, 
both from a cost and timing standpoint, is getting permit approval from 
these various regional authorities, and we've pioneered a novel approach.
 
It's sort of an innovation
 
applied to bureaucracy frankly, which enterprising 
and planning vision which are anything. And we've gotten a massive number 
of housing approval authorities to take a generic template, as opposed to a 
custom template, which makes it 
--
 
and in most cases I
 
think electronic, as 
well. So that just makes it simple and low cost and fast to get approval for 
solar, which is how it should be.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Totally. Yeah, around 350 cities and counties have accepted it.
 
Elon Musk
 
And more coming
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Many more coming.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I think ultimately it will be almost everyone.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, yeah, we have a lot more small cities and counties that have to come 
online, but that will be our focus in the coming days. And it's more important 
as 
we scale Solar Roof too. For all our deploying energy products, we need 
the innovation in the bureaucracy space that you said as well.
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean, yeah.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, so all these improvements have led us to speed up our customer order 
to in
stallation timelines from months to, in many cases, days. As Elon, you 
already said, we've added the option to add Powerwalls to secure people 
from future power outages and home installed Powerwall 
--
 
as was shown in 
the recent California outages, many hom
es ran successfully.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, you can tell which homes have a Powerwall because that's where the 
lights are on. Look at the neighborhood, it all but a few lights are out, and 
there's usually the ones with the Tesla Powerwall.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think also like the single truck roll 
--
 
yeah, single visit install is a big deal. 
We're taking it from where the solar industry would often be three visits 
before the solar was installed and would often take a lot of time to do the 
installatio
n. But we've streamlined all of that to the point where in many 
cases it's a single visit to do everything, and it's fast, minimized disruption 
to the homeowner. And ordering solar is literally one click. You can order 
solar for you house in less than one 
minute.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, and then we have done the same thing in the commercial solar space. 
Nobody thought of putting a simple left side with prices for commercial solar. 
We do that now, and we've seen a good response from small businesses 
wanting t
o go solar.
 
And by removing the complexity of long
-
term contracts and simplifying the 
terms and conditions, a commercial solar sales process would typically take 
six months is now taking a couple of weeks. So the same thing that we have 
done in residential
, we want to expand more and more in commercial as 
well.
 
So all in all, the roadmap for energy products from solar, Solar Roof, 
Powerwall to Megapack is superexciting, and I expect Tesla Energy to 
become a larger part of our overall ecosystem as we leverag
e and integrate 
the same competencies from our Vehicle business. The future is pretty 
exciting for Tesla Energy.
 
Elon Musk
 
Great, thanks.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. So first we're going to take some questions from 
say.com. We will then take 
questions from both institutional investors as 
well as retail investors.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Q 
-
 
Martin Viecha
 
So, the first question from institutional investors is, what are the 
opportunities for Tesla to create demand? Is word of mouth 
still sufficient or 
should we expect to see Tesla commerce advertising in the near future.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, what we're seeing is that word of mouth is more than enough to drive 
our demand in excess of production. We have no plans to advertise at this 
time. 
At some point in the future, we may do advertising not in the 
traditional sense but more to just inform people and make sure they are 
aware of the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is 
commonplace in advertising.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. The n
ext question from institutional investor is, Elon, other than robo
-
taxis and autonomous vehicle capabilities, when you look over the next 
three years, what are you most excited about at Tesla that you believe 
investors don't understand or have missed?
 
Elon
 
Musk
 
I think there is generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the 
growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal was talking about. In the long term, I 
expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla's 
automotive sector or business
. This is the most underappreciated group. I 
think it could be bigger, but it's certainly of a similar magnitude to Tesla 
Solar. Meaning, if you take Tesla Solar plus battery stuff, Tesla Energy is, I 
think, the least appreciated element.
 
And part of it is
 
like, for about 18 months, almost two years, we had to 
divert a tremendous amount of resources. We had to basically take 
resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the 
Model 3 production 
--
 
fixing the Model 3 production ramp and simpl
ifying the 
design of the Model 3.
 
So, for about a year
-
and
-
a
-
half, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of 
engineering and other resources and even took the cell production lines that 
were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to the car 
because we didn't have enough cells.
 
Now that we feel that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a 
great place, we've restored resources to Tesla Solar and storage. And so 
that's going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far into t
he future 
as I can imagine. And but we had to do it because if we didn't solve Model 3, 
Tesla wouldn't survive. So unfortunately, that shorted pretty much the other 
parts of the company.
 
But it would be difficult for me to overstate the degree to which, I 
think, 
Tesla Energy is going to be a major part of Tesla's activity in the future. And 
Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of 
sustainable energy, that means sustainable energy generation and 
sustainable energy consumption i
n the form of vehicles, electric vehicles.
 
And I think one of the stats we will publish in the future along with our 
vehicle production is that how much sustainable energy Tesla produced, or 
Tesla customers produced with our products. And I think you'll se
e that 
we're producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable 
energy as are consumed in the car 
--
 
in our cars.
 
Because for the longest time, the rebuttal against electric cars is like, don't 
they use dirty power from coal? Well, no, we're sol
ar power. Obviously the 
solar power came from companies, not just Tesla. Yeah, sustainable 
generation and sustainable consumption, and that's what we're doing. And 
we'll do more of it.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Thank you. The next question from investor is relat
ed to full self
-
driving attach rates. Given that self
-
driving regulations will evolve unevenly 
in different markets, would you consider selling modules individually? For 
example, navigate an Autopilot or Summon versus current strategy of selling 
the packag
e as a whole in order to encourage adoption and getting more 
data?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think we'll continue to sell it in a bundled fashion. I mean, any Tesla that 
you buy already has basic Autopilot included. So, I think that's 
--
 
that really 
is a pretty major ad
vantage relative to other cars. But then, the next step 
will be full self
-
driving with Smart Summon being kind of the beginning of 
that. And obviously, we kind of have the two sides of it 
--
 
highway Autopilot 
and we've got Summon which is sort of low speed
 
in parking lots and that 
kind of thing.
 
Now we need to work on solving the intermediate portion which is traffic 
lights and stop signs, and navigating through windy roads and 
--
 
windy 
narrow roads in suburban neighborhoods. That's the focus right now. You
're 
going to want it all. That's the answer. Something everyone is going to want 
for sure.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay.
 
Elon Musk
 
And as I said before, at the point which we're able to upload the software 
enabling a Tesla to become a robo
-
taxi, expect to have 
that from a 
functionality standpoint by the end of next year. In terms of the functionality 
--
 
basic functionality aspirationally end of this year but reliable enough that 
you do not need to pay attention in our opinion by the end of next year.
 
And it woul
d need 
--
 
the acceptance by regulatory authorities will vary by 
jurisdiction. But that transition, that sort of flipping the switch from a car 
that is from not robo
-
taxi to robo
-
taxi, I think, will probably be the biggest 
step change increase in asset valu
e in history by far.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Thank you. The next question is, with respect to Model Y, what is your 
latest expectations for launch timing? Do you anticipate any Model 3 
production downtime at Fremont during the launch? And how should Model Y 
gr
oss margin percent look compared to Model 3 gross margin?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we've talked about the launch time. What really matters is the timing 
to volume production where volume production is some number in excess of 
1,000 units per week. And we're confide
nt of reaching that point no later 
than the middle of 2020.
 
Yeah, so from an interest standpoint, we do not expect it to interfere. Yeah, 
the body line is separate, the paint line is 
--
 
basically we do not expect it to 
interfere with Model 3. No, we do not
 
expect any downtime. From a margin 
standpoint, Zachary, do you want to add anything?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, from a margin perspective, we're expecting ASPs for Model Y to be 
slightly higher than they are for Model 3, and this is common in the industry 
bet
ween sedans and CUVs. The part that we've worked very hard on is 
controlling the cost of Model Y, and our steady state forecast for that 
program puts the cost at roughly equivalent to Model 3.
 
There will be ramp in efficiencies at first, of course, as we l
aunch the 
program, but as it stabilizes with steady state production, we do expect that 
it will be a higher margin product. It's something that we're very excited 
about within the company.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Thank you. And the last question from instituti
onal investors is, can 
you provide an update on FSD package attach rates? As FSD attach rates 
improve, will you let the financial benefits manifest in higher gross margins 
for company and shareholders or will you lower the price to drive delivery 
volume?
 
Z
achary Kirkhorn
 
I don't think we're going to need to lower the price of FSD. I expect the price 
of FSD to increase slowly as the functionality and capability improve. That's 
-
-
 
that is unchanged. Anything to add on to that? I mean, our cash gross 
margin ob
viously is higher than our GAAP gross margin because of 
unrecognized revenue associated with FSD attach rates.
 
So that's why I think it's in the order of $600 million or in the order of $0.5 
billion of unrecognized revenue. So if you were to include that, 
which is 
obviously recognized as we release the full self
-
driving functionalities, the 
actual gross margin we're operating in on a cash basis today is higher than 
the GAAP gross margin.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Let's now go to questions from retail investors. T
he first question from 
Craig is, can you provide more detail on the DeepScale acquisition, its 
importance, and whether Tesla is still on track to recognize and respond to 
traffic lights and stop signs with automatic driving on city streets by the end 
of 20
19?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. DeepScale is a very tiny company. It's basically about 12 people, and 
they have some expertise in increasing the efficiency of neural nets for a 
given amount of compute, which I think is helpful. So it remains to be seen, 
but the intent
 
behind what was a very tiny acquisition was to, I think, 
slightly accelerate FSD. That is the intent, and hopefully that will turn out to 
be true. Yeah.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. The second question, we've already answered regarding Model Y 
delivery. So we'll j
ump to the third question from Craig. News reports 
suggest that Gigafactory may already be producing Model 3s for Chinese 
market. Could you please update us on the production expectations for Giga 
3? And confirm purpose of the second building now being bui
lt. Is that for 
battery production as suggested by some press outlets?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, we're in trial production of Model 3, basically sending cars through the 
system, and we're ramping rapidly. We're expecting to hit volume 
production in a few months esse
ntially. The second building is indeed for 
battery and module production. And there's probably 
--
 
there's obviously a 
bunch more construction beyond what is already there because obviously we 
need to build out more facilities for Model Y production at Shan
ghai as well.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the 
initial results of Tesla car insurance? Is there a timeline to expand it 
nationally and internationally?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, I can take that. So far, 
we've launched Tesla Insurance in California. I 
have to say that I'm quite pleased by the results so far. The take rates as 
measured by quote
-
to
-
purchase conversion are quite high by industry 
standards, and we expect that this will only increase as folks u
nderstand the 
products better and receive some of the known price increases coming from 
some of the standard carriers that they'll come to us and look for an 
alternative.
 
There's a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the 
product, particu
larly the purchase flow, to make sure it's the best product 
experience for our customers. And we're also working very hard to get other 
states lined up in the States, and then also to launch in some countries 
internationally. So we're not able to provide s
pecific timelines on those 
changes, but we're definitely working as quickly as we can, given how well 
received Tesla Insurance has been in California.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I think it also has a secondary effect of insuring that the third
-
party 
providers of insurance provide reasonable rates to our customers.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Completely agree. The goal here is not to have an outsized market share of 
insurance, it's just to make sure that their customers have an alternative to 
other companies, as 
well, if those rates are high. I mean, ultimately what 
makes the most sense for a total cost of ownership perspective is for folks to 
have good pricing on their insurance.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Exactly.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. And the last question from retail invest
ors. There is skepticism 
regarding your comment that the full self
-
driving will be feature
-
complete by 
year
-
end, like resulting from confusion about feature
-
complete, what 
feature
-
complete means. Could you please talk to this and perhaps give us a 
list of 
features that establish the FSD baseline?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, feature
-
complete, I mean, it's 
--
 
the car is able to drive from one's 
house to work, most likely without interventions. So it will still be 
supervised, but it will be able to drive 
--
 
it will fill i
n the gap from low
-
speed 
autonomy 
--
 
low speed autonomy with Summon. You've got high
-
speed 
autonomy on the highway, and intermediate speed autonomy, which really 
just means traffic lights and stop signs.
 
So feature
-
complete means it's most likely able to d
o that without 
intervention, without human intervention, but it would still be supervised. 
And I've gone through this timeline before several times, but it is often 
misconstrued that there's three major levels to autonomy. There's the car 
being able to be 
autonomous, but requiring supervision and intervention at 
times. That's feature complete. Then there's 
--
 
and it doesn't mean like 
every scenario, everywhere on earth, including ever corner case, it just 
means most of the time.
 
And then, there's another le
vel which is that we think it's 
--
 
that from a 
Tesla standpoint, we think the car is safe enough to be driven without 
supervision. Then the third level would be that regulators are also convinced 
that the car can be driven autonomously without supervision.
 
Those are 
three different levels.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Thank you very much. Sherry, we can now go to the questions from 
analysts.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan 
Galves with Wolfe Research.
 
Dan Galves
 
Hey, guys
. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping that you could give 
us a little bit more color on sizing up the key factors in the auto gross 
margin improvement from Q3 to Q2, particularly you mentioned some 
nonrecurring items in the letter. And also, should
 
investors be prepared for 
any meaningful headwinds as the China plant comes up, but isn't at full 
production yet?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, I can provide a couple of comments on that. On your final 
--
 
on your 
last question about China headwinds, there are al
ways ramp inefficiencies 
when we launch a new factory. So we don't expect China to be any different 
than that. So there will be some that we experience in Q4.
 
The amount of that is hard to forecast, given that it's a different type of 
factory design than w
e did here in Fremont. We're working very hard to limit 
the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly fixed cost absorption and having all of 
the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.
 
On the margin improvement, a couple of things there for Auto gross 
margin. 
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, S and X average selling prices 
increased from Q2 to Q3. I mean, that's important, as I mentioned in the 
last earnings call. The prior powertrain versions of S and X provided 
significant headwinds on average sel
ling price for that product in the 
quarter.
 
We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in 
how we adjust pricing on our products and how we optimize that based on 
local supply and demand. And so, I think there is a bunch of good wo
rk from 
the team on that in Q3, which we allude to in our financials.
 
And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us. It's hard to 
underestimate how much of that has been engrained in the culture of the 
company. And Jerome and his team have done 
absolutely tremendous work 
there. So, on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing, labor, 
warehousing, logistics, there's just a tremendous amount of good work that 
happened there.
 
Specifically, on nonrecurring items, two that I'll note, on
e being the Smart 
Summon revenue recognition, debatable whether that's considered recurring 
or not given that we continue to expect to release more features and release 
revenue associated with that in the future, but we did want to call that out 
specifical
ly and the dollar value around that because we know there's been 
speculation around the impact for the quarter. And foreign exchange is just 
something that since we don't hedge, it has an impact, and it comes and 
goes every quarter. So we'll have to see as
 
the quarter plays out the effect 
that that has.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
 
George Dailey
 
Hi, everyone. This is George Dailey on for Adam. So, first question, is it a 
fair assumption to say that 
once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the 
Model 3 sold in China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, 
even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
That one is also difficult to forecast, it's a goo
d question. At least based on 
the plans that we have now, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with 
where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremont factory. There's still a bunch of 
work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp 
inef
ficiencies, and we need to work those costs down.
 
And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the 
country and where we ultimately land on the product offering. So I think just 
for now, it's safe to assume that it's roughly in line w
ith the margins that 
you see coming out of the Fremont facility.

Great. And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it's been over seven 
years since you launched the Model S. And many OEMs seem that they don't 
have the same commitment to 
battery electric vehicles that you do, and 
many don't even offer one right now. As your business model proves to be 
more sustainable, could we potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other 
OEMs with batteries or software or complete electric vehicle architec
tures 
maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable transport?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I think there's 
--
 
it would be consistent with the mission of Tesla to 
help other car companies with electric vehicles on the battery and 
powertrain front, possi
bly on other fronts. So it's something we're open to. 
As a lot of people know, we open sourced our patents so that those would 
not serve as an obstacle to the adoption of electric vehicles or solar power or 
stationary storage. And we're definitely open to 
supplying batteries and 
powertrains and perhaps other things to other car companies.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Thank you. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.
 
Maynard Um
 
Hi. Thank you.
 
I have two questions. The first is, Software Version 10.0 
added a lot of functionality that's never really been available in a car before 
through an over
-
the
-
air update. In your shareholder letter, you say that this 
lays an important foundation for things
 
to come. Can you just talk about the 
longer
-
term plan or your vision for the direction of the software platform, 
and if you have plans to monetize that opportunity?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, the goal for the infotainment system is to say what's the most amount 
of f
un you can have in a car, which I think 
--
 
I don't think other car 
companies really think about it that way. But certainly, what is the most fun 
--
 
how can we maximize the enjoyment of a car such that it's not some just 
some sort of transport utility devic
e with no soul and no character.
 
We want it to be fun and entertaining, a reverence, something that you love. 
And so, there's a lot one can do because people are generally spending a 
couple hours a day on average in their car, and so that's pretty high 
per
centage of their waking time, outside of like showering and going to the 
bathroom and that kind of thing. It's a lot of time. And I guess, maybe 
there's some way to monetize it, but we haven't really thought about it that 
way.
 
Our goal is to just make 
--
 
s
ay what is the most fun you can possibly have 
while you're in your car. And obviously as autonomy gets better and better, 
that is going to become much more of an entertainment opportunity. So 
we'll see where that leads, but that's what we're after. That's 
our goal.
 
Maynard Um
 
Great. And then, can you help us help frame the opportunity for emission 
credits? As the standards in the EU starts to tighten next year, and I'm not 
looking for an exact number, but maybe more to understand whether this is 
an opportun
ity in the tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, anything 
to help us frame the opportunity, and also whether you have any ongoing 
dialogues with OEM? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
We certainly have ongoing dialogues with OEMs, but as you see from our 
finan
cials, the tax credits or emissions credits are not forming a very big 
percentage of our revenue. They're 
--
 
I mean, Zack, what was the last 
quarter? It was really quite...
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
It was over $100 million.
 
Elon Musk
 
But out of like several billio
n. So it's like 1.5%. It's not 
--
 
it's not exactly a 
giant percentage. And obviously there's credits in the US are really not 
--
 
the credit situation not particularly strong for obvious reasons, which we 
think is not great for the future, but anyway that's
 
the way it is. In Europe, 
there's much more of a sensitivity to the environment, but we're not 
counting on some big windfall, maybe it will be good, maybe not, we don't 
know. But we're not counting on it.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, I think that's a fair way t
o characterize it. I mean, our expectations 
are that credit revenues will generally increase with time, not necessarily 
increasing every quarter. We did increase from Q2 to Q3, but there's a 
certain amount of them that are baseline based on the number of c
ars that 
we build and deliver, and there's others that are deal specific, and those 
deals can happen at any point.
 
So we're constantly in conversations with auto makers about this, but within 
the company, we manage the business without counting on any 
profit or 
cash flows from regulatory credits, and we view it as purely incremental. 
And my recommendation is that everyone should feel it that way. It's just an 
extra that comes through.
 
Elon Musk
 
It's obviously a good thing to do that would help accelerat
e the advent of 
sustainable energy for sure. But it's 
--
 
and I think outside the US, there 
seems to be a strong push in that direction, which is great. And probably 
within the US, that over time will become a strong push.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go 
to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Unidentified Corporate Participant
 
Hi. It's Edison [ph] on for Emmanuel. Thanks for taking our questions. First, 
there's been a lot of 
activity in the industry about electric pickups lately. Just 
curious if you have any updates, anymore insights you can share on the one 
that you're about to put out later? And then, secondly, there was a comment 
I think earlier about the order book quarter
-
to
-
date. Can you just clarify 
what was the baseline? And any insights about the geographic mix of that? 
Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, we're not 
--
 
I think we've said enough about the Tesla Cyber Truck. 
We're not going to 
--
 
this is not the right forum for us to
 
do product 
launches. But I think it would be 
--
 
I mean, my opinion, and this could be 
totally wrong. I could be totally out to lunch here, but I think the Tesla 
Cyber Truck is our best product ever. That's my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. And 
demand is not 
--
 
it s
eems to be strong. We should be production constrained 
this quarter.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, that's right. The baseline from the comment earlier that I made was 
looking at this point in the quarter in Q2, and order rates are strong, I would 
say, in all mark
ets. I think we're very encouraged as a team at the reception 
of our products as more and more people become aware of electric vehicles.
 
I think competitive products help raise that awareness, and overall interest 
is just increasing. So our focus internall
y is to increase production as fast as 
we can both with the existing equipment and accelerating our timelines on 
new capacity. We believe that everybody should be driving an electric car, so 
we need to move as quickly as we can.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, absolutely.
 
We want to get the Tesla volume to where it is perhaps 
somewhere on the order of 1%, replacing 1% of the global fleet over time. 
That's, I think, the global fleet is pretty big. We think that's a good one to 
aim for, which is about 20 million vehicles a y
ear, just by the way.
 
But I do think that the demand for new cars will rise as the world transitions 
away from combustion engine vehicles, just as when people had CRT TVs, 
there's no cathode ray tube TVs, the sales rate was just basically 
replacement rate.
 
You wouldn't really buy a new CRT TV unless yours broke.
 
But when flat screens came out, there was a big step change in demand 
because now getting a big flat screen TV was much better than having a 
small CRT TV. I think we'll see the same thing with elect
ric vehicles, which is 
that instead of people just buying a car just because their last car wore out, 
they'll buy an electric car because they're fundamentally a better car, and 
especially if it's got self
-
driving.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go to the 
next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street 
Research.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just feel how you...
 
Elon Musk
 
Hi, Pierre. We cannot hear you.
 
Martin Viecha
 
It's very q
uiet, so we can't hear you.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Can you hear me now?
 
Elon Musk
 
It's muffled, but we'll try.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Okay. Sorry for that. So, I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on 
Model S and Model X. It looks like the deliveries have stayed to the 
deliveries of the previous quarter and that Model 3 has indeed cannibalized 
the demand for these cars, quite a b
ig deal. So how are you thinking about 
these two models going forward? What's the strategy you have in mind? And 
I have a quick follow
-
up on the Model Y.
 
Elon Musk
 
The Model S and X are really niche 
--
 
they're really niche products. I mean, 
they're very ex
pensive, made in low volume. To be totally frank, we're 
continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else. 
They're really of minor importance to the future.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Okay. That makes sense. And then, my question...
 
Elon Musk
 
The
y're great cars. The Model S I think if you want 
--
 
I mean, the Model S 
literally won Motor Trend's best car ever in history by the way. I think if 
you're out there and you're buying 
--
 
and you're going to buy a Model S, I 
think you just made a mistake, to
 
be totally frank. It's incredible, especially 
the new one with variable damping suspension, hospital operating room, 
HEPA filter for air purification, the raven powertrain.
 
It's the fastest car in the world, and it's just so easy to drive. It makes you 
fe
el like Superman driving that car. It's incredibly safe. It's just an amazing 
vehicle. And then, Model S, I think, is like Faberge egg of cars. I mean, not 
Model X. Model X is like the Faberge egg of cars. Yeah, that's why so many 
artists and musicians buy
 
the car. It's an art piece basically.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, just to add 
--
 
I agree. They're absolutely phenomenal cars. And we 
are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to 
increasing demand. And so, I think part of the s
tory here is, as we have 
launched, ramped and stabilized Model 3, that's kind of consumed a lot of 
the attention around the company.
 
But now as that has stabilized, we're able to focus our attention and balance 
that between S and X and Model 3. So, the del
ivery numbers in Q3 
understated the interest in the product for that quarter. And we continue to 
see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and 
X deliveries in Q4.
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean, Model S 
--
 
basic Model S at this point has
 
a range of 370 miles. 
Actually, technically it's 373, but we actually certified it incorrectly as 370, 
but it's 373. And there are some software improvements that we think will 
make that even better.
 
I forgot to mention, we're also expecting there's going
 
to be an over
-
the
-
air 
improvement that will improve the power of the Model S, X, and 3. That's, 
by the way coming in a few weeks. Should be in the order of 5% power 
improvement due to improved firmware. Drew, do you want to say anything 
on that?
 
Drew Bagl
ino
 
Yeah, we just continue to learn how to optimize the motor control in our 
products. And yeah, so 5% improvement for all Model 3 customers and 3% 
for S and X.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, and there's also the single pedal driving that will improve the range as 
well.
 
Drew Baglino
 
Very excited about that. It's an improvement in comfort and feel.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, it's easier to drive. And it improves the range.
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes. And faster super charging.
 
Elon Musk
 
Faster super charging, yeah.
 
Drew Baglino
 
For 
Standard Range and Standard Range Plus customers, which is a big deal.
 
Elon Musk
 
I don't think there's ever been a situation in history where you buy a car and 
it gets way better over time just through the software. Not a little bit better, 
but a lot.
 
Drew
 
Baglino
 
It's very exciting, I think. Yeah. As a customer myself, I enjoy these 
updates. I always look forward to them.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, might move the Model S range to almost 380 or high 370s with the 
update.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And we're not stopping to work
 
there. We'll continue working on these 
developments.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, absolutely.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Pierre, did you have a follow
-
up question?
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Yeah, just a quick one on the Model Y. So, I was wondering what you have 
learned with S and X that mak
e you think maybe when you launch Model Y, 
you have some cannibalization of demand on the Model 3? And have you 
started to think about that and how to approach it?
 
Elon Musk
 
No, I don't think. We're not expecting to see cannibalization of Model 3, one 
is a
 
sedan and one is an SUV.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, the best comparison we have for that is when we launched Model X 
and we had Model S at the time.
 
Elon Musk
 
Model S sales increased.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, and we didn't see any cannibalization there.
 
Elon Mu
sk
 
The opposite. When we launched Model X, Model S sales increased.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, so that's the best comparison that we have.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes 
from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
 
Dan Levy
 
Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. First, just wanted to 
ask a question on Giga III. You're targeting 3,000 units a week. But we saw 
with Fremont that the ramp on Model 3 was lumpy. And you sort
 
of ramp 
and then sort of cut production to fix the bottlenecks.
 
Given this is a brand
-
new capacity, how smooth should we expect 
production to be on a week
-
to
-
week basis? Meaning, once you hit the 3,000, 
is that 3,000 you could go every single week in a qu
arter or is it still going to 
be lumpy within a quarter?
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean, if you've got a crystal ball, we'd love to use it.
 
Dan Levy
 
I'm looking for it.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, it should be smoother than Model 3 because there's a lot of 
commonality of parts. But
 
--
 
and I think if you look over a reasonable 
enough time frame, the production will actually be fairly smooth. But from a 
week to week standpoint, it obviously will not be.
 
It will be about as smooth as, say, the stock market. How smooth is the 
stock mark
et from one week to the next? But if you just extend the time 
period to, say, two or three
-
quarters, it will be very rapid steady ground. 
And obviously it will go way past 3,000 a week.
 
Dan Levy
 
Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, just a follow
-
up. You menti
oned 
--
 
Elon, 
you mentioned earlier in your comments that one of the things you're 
optimistic on in the future is Tesla Energy, and I think we understand the 
part that one of the challenges in the past was sort of a reallocation of 
resources away from Ener
gy to the Auto side.
 
Could you just talk to where you see the greatest pockets of growth in 
Energy, is it Solar or Storage? And now that you can reallocate resources, 
what would that entail in terms of capacity? Or what does reallocation of 
resources look 
like?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I think, on a percentage basis, Solar will grow the fastest, but Storage 
will also grow higher on a percentage basis. I think both over time will grow 
faster than Automotive. They're starting from a smaller base.
 
I think, especially i
f you look at sort of 
--
 
if you look at like year
-
over
-
year 
growth, it will be absolutely incredible, I think. From one quarter to the next, 
there might be some fluctuations due to seasonality or some short
-
term 
parts shortage or you name it, but over the 
course of, say, a year, gigantic 
increase.
 
Also, with Solar, it's hard to install a lot of solar in the winter, especially on 
the East Coast. The roofs are full of snow and ice. So you will expect to see 
some seasonality there, but then it ramps up quite a
 
bit as the weather 
improves. Yeah.

2/24/17,Tesla,"All right. Thank you. My apologies. We actually tried a new audio system 
with a bunch of individual mics that seems to have malfunctioned, so we 
went back to our standard conference call object. Anyway, I just want to 
confirm people can hear what I'm 
saying? Okay. Great.
 
So first of all, I want to say that Friday night was an amazing time for Tesla. 
It was one of the most important days in the history of the company. It's 
something we've been striving for, for 14 years. It's the car that we 

 
the 
Model
 
3 having with us steady production of Model 3s (11:36) was an 
incredible milestone in the company's history. We wanted to make a great, 
affordable electric car which is a fundamental thing that is missing. We 
wanted to make that from day one, and if we co
uld only have done it 
sooner, we would have. And I'm glad that this day has come.
 
What we have ahead of us, of course, is an incredibly difficult production 
ramp. Nonetheless, I think we've got a great team, and I'm very confident 
that we will be able to r
each a production rate of 10,000 vehicles per week 
towards the end of next year. And we remain 

 
we believe on track to 
achieve a 5,000 unit week by the end of this year.
 
So, I would simply urge people to not get too caught up in what exactly falls 
within 
the exact calendar boundaries of a quarter, one quarter or the next, 
because when you have an exponentially growing production ramp, slight 
changes of a few weeks here or there can appear to have dramatic changes, 
but that is simply because of the arbitrar
y nature of when a quarter ends.
 
But what people should absolutely have zero concern about is that Tesla will 
achieve a 10,000 unit production week by the end of next year.
 
So, if you can sort of see where we came from, the Roadster 

 
we were 
making only 6
00 units a week where the non
-
powertrain portion of the car 
was made by Lotus. And we did the powertrain and final assembly of the 
car, and then we went from that to 20,000 units a year of the Model S, a far 
more complex car, where we did the whole thing. 
And then with Model 3, we 
are more vertically integrated. I think people should really not have any 
concerns that we will reach that outcome from a production rate.
 
We're also very confident about costs. We feel we gained a lot of experience. 
We certainly 
aspire to learn from the mistakes of the past, and I think we 
largely have. Deepak will go into some of our margin expectations there. 
And unlike, say, for example, the Model X, where the mistake that we made, 
and I obviously take the prime responsibility 
here, was having far too much 
advanced technology in version one of our product. Model X is an incredible 
car, but it was overreaching for the first
-
generation of the product.
 
In the case of Model 3, we're strived hard to simplify and make sure that it 
has
 
everything essentially to be a fantastic car. If you see the reviews, the 
reviews are 

 
one could not ask for better reviews. And I just thought I'd 
give you one little anecdote, which was 

 
which I found quite surprising is 
that when we were giving test 
drives to 

 
or the journalists were driving the 
car and doing test drives. About 80% of the journalists said that they would 
buy the car themselves. Most of the remaining 20% said probably. This is 
crazy. I've never seen anything like it.
 
So this is a very
 
good sign. It should also be noted that one of our big 
concerns was that Model S, particularly, and Model X demand would suffer 
with the introduction of the Model 3. In fact, this has turned out to be the 
opposite situation. Model S and Model X demand inc
reased with the release 
of Model 3.
 
Jon, would you like to just elaborate on that? We did express this as a 
concern.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And it was a big concern, but it has turned out to be a pleasant 
surprise.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. I think that's right. Not only as Elon said, we expressed it is a concern. 
We had positive comps, both year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter in 
orders in the second quarter. But since then, orders have accele
rated in July 
as we noted in our shareholder letter. And they've accelerated further since 
the hand
-
over event on Friday for the Model 3.
 
So, it clearly shows that S and X as our flagship products have a strong 
position in the market and strong demand. And
 
that's super encouraging 
that we've got a strong product lineup with three cars that are proving to be 
very popular in their individual segments.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. In fact, I don't know 

 
I think we mentioned some of this in the 
earnings 
letter, but just some of the key stats on, say, July orders for S and 
X were...
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. July orders were 15% higher than our Q2 average weekly order rate, so 
we accelerated off of Q2 into July.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And as we noted in the shareholder letter, deliveries grew by 53% compared 
to the Q2 2016 in a flat luxury vehicle market, so we're gaining share...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
In a 
flat
-
to
-
down market, and the order has accelerated.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So July was one of our best months ever.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Again, contrary to our expectations, I want to emphasize. Of course
, who 
knows if this will continue, but all indications are that it will. So that's very 
exciting.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
A side note, we're making great progress on our internal Autopilot software. 
It's getting be
tter and better. I'm really, really excited. I test drive the latest 
development release as soon as it comes out, and I'm like this is really 
getting to be something special. Yes, it's really, and I think it's going to 
accelerate from here. And the talent 
that we're seeing join on the technical 
side for Autopilot is really world
-
class. I don't think there's 

 
it's unmatched 
anywhere, I would say.
 
So, let's see, Model 3 net orders are 

 
there's not that many cancellations 

 
about 1,800 a day. I want to empha
size you can't see the car, unless you 
want to look at pictures online. You can't test drive a car. You have to put 
down a $1,000 deposit.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We're not promoting the car.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We're not promoting the car
. If you go to our stores, we don't even want to 
talk about it, really, because we want to talk about the thing that we can 
supply. If somebody orders a Model 3 now, it's probably late next
-
year 
before they get it. We want to give people a car where it's, 
in fact, maybe a 
one
-
 
or two
-
month wait for an S or an X.
 
I think the point that we're trying to make is that the S is still a superior 
sedan. It seems to have come through, and that's true. Things got a little 
confusing because of the nomenclature of bein
g Model 3 versus Model S and 
X, which was, I guess, sort of my fault, being too clever for my own good 
there, because especially the Model E, as you can tell, I have a wonderful 
sense of humor.
 
But then people mistook that for generation three, but in fact
, if you look at, 
say, what we're really on right now? I would say is approximately generation 
four. We're on generation four of S, X and 3. At the risk of really confusing 
matters. Model 3 is generation four, but so are S and X. We evolve the 
technology a
ll at the same time.
 
So overall, looking really good. And then Solar Roof 

 
we have installed and 
working the Solar Roof tiles. I have it on my house. JB has it on his house. I 
think we included some of the pictures in the earnings letter.
 
I want to emphas
ize that there's no Photoshopping on the roof. That is 
actually how it looks, and it wasn't taken by some 

 
it was take some pics 
with your phone and send them over. That's what we're talking about here, 
not some special lighting conditions, pro
-
photograph
er situation. And this is 
version one, and I think this roof's going look really knockout as we just 
keep iterating.
 
Now it is a very challenging technical task to get this right, get the costs 
good, streamline the installation process, ramp up the product
ion. Again, 
this is sort of follows a similar S
-
curve to vehicles where it starts up very 
slow, but then it grows exponentially.
 
Also, our conventional solar is doing quite well and generating significant 
positive cash flow 

 
just standard flat panel stuff
, which, I think, is still the 
right solution for any kind of flat roof situation, which is most commercial 
installations in a lot of houses, or some part of the roof where it's really not 
visible and therefore, doesn't really matter from an aesthetic stan
dpoint.
 
And then, batteries 

 
also making great progress on the battery front. I'm 
hoping to do something around the International Astronautical Congress, 
which is in Adelaide this year. Not promising anything, but we're 
aspirationally going to have a very
 
substantial portion of the battery pack, 
already done in about eight weeks, which is hard because we have all the 
shipping and logistics challenges of getting things across the Pacific.
 
Not promising anything. It's an aspirational goal. Team's working sup
er hard 
to make it happen. But I'm excited about the prospect, and I feel, of course, 
optimistic that that will take place. So, yes, I think and we're really proud of 
the Tesla team for getting to this point. And I really want to thank the whole 
Tesla team
, and we already have 33,000 people at this point, for working 
hard to achieve some very difficult things. And I can be prouder to work with 
such a great team. So, let me go to 

 
anything else you want to add, guys? 
All right. Let's go to questions.
 
Jeffre

Tesla, Inc.
 
All right. Shree, let's open it up to Q&A. And everybody in Q&A, we have a 
lot of people in queue, so Shree's going to be real hard core on the one 
question, one follow

up.

I wanted to ask if I may, my one question on capital expenditures. Wanted 
to get an idea, what comes next with respect to some of your spending on 
the Model 3? And I guess, if I can nest one in, 
related to (25:23).

It's one question on CapEx. But really want to understand what the big next 
steps are in 3Q and 4Q as we 
start to kind of build
-
out our models and 
figure out from there? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
Certainly. I mean, I do want to emphasize like but a lot of us is actually very 
hard for us to know. When we make mistakes is because we're stupid, not 
b
ecause we're trying to mislead anyone. I just want to emphasize 

 
I 

 
we 
aspire to be less dumb over time. So if I knew it, I would tell you. It's sort of 
like I've got this, like secret hand of cards that I'm holding close to my vest 
and I'm not telling y
ou. It's just fundamentally impossible to predict the 
exponential part of the manufacturing S
-
curve. It's crazy hard. And S
-
curve 
is a simplification because it's really running through a series of constraints 
that, if you 

 
it's like a really jagged sort 
of upward growth and it'll plateau 
and then it'll grow rapidly, and it'll plateau again. And then sometimes it'll go 
backwards because something broke.
 
Yes. When I said manufacturing hell and supply
-
chain hell on Friday. I 
meant it. I mean, we know this. S
igned up for it. Not blaming hell because 
when we bought the ticket. So but I think at a high level, I don't think we 
should expect any significant negative surprises. There will be 

 
as usual be 
the case, there tends to be some cost growth in CapEx for un
expected 
things. So we've got to expedite this, you've got to fix that, or this supplier 
doesn't work out, or this machine we bought doesn't work out. And you've 
got to be all hands on deck 24/7 to fix it or replace it. But I don't expect any 
significant 

 
I think that is relatively contained. Deepak, do you want to...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, I think maybe the other way, James, to answer your question is.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You need to talk to close with this.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Y
es. I think you're asking where we are spending the money. I think it's in 
the completion of the Model 3. We are bidding
-
off on the equipment.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right. We are.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. And also, we are just 
continuing with the construction of Gigafactory to 
continue to scale that. And so that's where the majority of our CapEx...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Overwhelmingly.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Listed there. Overwhelmi
ngly.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Overwhelming (28:14).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Overwhelmingly is Model 3. Obviously, there are expenditures associated 
with the Solar Roof and with our Buffalo factory.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Correct.
 
Elon 
Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We're trying to keep those relatively light for the next few months.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
In the marketing and sales, we're growing our infrastructure there and our 
Supercharger networks. Those are the other smaller piece.
 
El
on Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Just on the Buffalo front 

 
I really want to emphasize, we expect the 
Buffalo Gigafactory to be a powerhouse of solar panel and solar glass tile 
output. It is going be a kick
-
ass facility. We have made that commitment to 
th
e State of New York. We are going to keep that commitment.
 
And then, we're also thinking hard about, where do we put Gigafactorys 
three, four, five and six? We expect to keep the majority of our production in 
the U.S., but it's, obviously, going to make se
nse to establish a Gigafactory 
in China and Europe to serve the markets there, because it's not to build 
cars (29:23) in California and truck them halfway around the world, 
particularly when you're trying to make things as affordable as possible 

 
that rea
lly hurts.
 
We really want to make our cars as affordable as possible. And so that does 
require some amount of local market production, particularly for the mass 
market vehicles in order to make it as accessible as possible.
 
So we're thinking hard about tha
t. I think we'll have some announcements 
on at least a few of those locations before the end of the year, but we don't 
expect to spend significant money on them. It's just identifying the location, 
doing the long
-
lead time stuff, the permits, the planning.
 
This doesn't cost a 
lot of money. It's only when you really start moving dirt and putting up 
concrete and steel and buying equipment that the big money starts to be 
required.
 
Yes. So anything you want to add on that?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No. That's 
good.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. And CapEx on Model S and X, it's not really 

 
it's minor compared to 
the next.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The next.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. There is continued improvement, of course, to keep pace with 
the Model 
3s. So that all of our products are at the same level of technology, but it's 
more painless (30:42) compared to the Model 3.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And we're continuing to achieve cost reductions on S and X, so there's a bit 
of investment, bu
t negligible.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Exactly. Absolutely. And in cases where we see cost reductions on S 
and X 

 
those are the cases where we want to pass along some of those cost 
reductions to customers. So overall, we're feeling really 

 
this
 
is maybe the 
best I've ever felt about Tesla, to be frank. Last week, stressed the hell out 
of me, but I really think that this is probably the best I've ever felt about the 
company.
 
Oh, and one thing I wanted to correct. I think in a prior call, we publi
cly had 
said that Model Y, or our compact SUV 

 
it's called Model Y. It may or may 
not be 

 
would be a totally new architecture. Upon the council of my 
executive team 

 
thank you. Thanks, guys 

 
who reeled me back from the 
cliffs of insanity 

 
much appreci
ated 

 
the Model Y will in fact be using a 
substantial carryover from Model 3 in order to bring its market faster.
 
Yes. So that will really accelerate our ability to get to Model Y to market 
faster, because fundamentally people prefer a sedan, people prefe
r an SUV. 
And in fact, the SUV market is larger. It's the biggest single product (32:35) 
I believe in the world.
 
So, I'd like to thank my executive team for stopping me from being a fool, 
and yes. The Model Y or whatever the hell will have relatively low t
echnical 
and production risk as a result. I still think we want to do the crazy thing in 
the future, but we will punt that until after the compact SUV.
 
Anything else you think I should add?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No. That's great. (33:06)
 
Elon Reeve Mu
sk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. We'll probably have as much time for questions as we can. We had a lot 
of operational issues to get back to, like to work on that manufacturing 
ramp, and I'm always incredibly grateful for anyone who is an investor in 
Tesla, and you p
ut your faith in us. We will do whatever is necessary to 
reward that faith.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
All right. Shree. Why don't we go to the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.
 
Rod 
Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thanks. I was going to ask you which is harder, AI or AV, but I think at this 
point we may not know the answer.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, as you know, I'm terrified of AI.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securitie
s, Inc.
 
I've read that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. You may have read that off a few places. And it's just something we 

 
anyway, I definitely don't want to derail the conversation on that front.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Right.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's just something that I think, anything that represents 

 
that is a risk to 
the public at least insight from the government, because one of the 
mandates of the government is the public well
-
being. And that insight is
 
different from oversight, so at least the government gained insight to 
understand what's going on, and then decide what rules are appropriate to 
ensure public safety. That is what I'm advocating for. I'm not advocating for 
that we stop the development of 
AI, or any of the sort of straw man, 
hyperbole things that have been written. I do think there are great benefits 
to AI. We just need to make sure that they're indeed benefits, and we don't 
do something really dumb.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, In
c.
 
Okay. Well, I hope that doesn't count against my Tesla questions. But the 
two things I was going to ask you were you mentioned in the letter this 
confidence in getting the 25% margin on Model 3. Could you just mention 
what the level of production is tha
t you feel you need to get to in order to 
get there? What run rate? And, secondly, there've been a fair number of 
battery announcements, solid
-
state battery technology, Toyota, and a few 
others.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Oh, man.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche B
ank Securities, Inc.
 
What's your general assessment? Are we getting close to some kind of 
breakthroughs here?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Oh, god.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Or what's your thoughts?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay. Her
e's my opinion. The battery breakthrough of the week, battery 
breakthrough du jour. When somebody has like some great claim that 
they've got this awesome battery, you know what, send us a sample. Or if 
you don't trust us, send it to an independent lab, whe
re the parameters can 
be verified. Otherwise, STF.
 
Yes. So everything works on PowerPoint. You know, I could give you a 
PowerPoint presentation about teleportation to the Andromeda Galaxy. That 
doesn't mean it works. So Tesla is the biggest buyer of lithiu
m ion batteries 
on earth. You know who people come to first when they've got a lithium ion 
battery? Us, because we're their biggest customer.
 
I would love it if we could have some breakthrough. It'd be awesome. I think 
there are some interesting things on 
the horizon. But then the time it takes 
from something working in the lab to working at moderate production levels 
to working at higher production levels to optimizing the cost is several years. 
So it's not like it suddenly pops out of nowhere. JB, do you 
want to add to 
that?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No. I totally agree with the sort of cautious skepticism on all these 
announcements. And just more specifically on the solid
-
state batteries, Rod. 
I mean, we've talked to a number of different groups t
hat are researching 
this. We actually have tested a number of those different prototype, very 
early prototype, single cells, but we don't yet see anything that changes our 
strategy, and we don't see anything there that's ...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
A
lthough we'd love it if it did. Please. Please. If someone please come up 
with a battery (37:43) breakthrough, we'd love it.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We would be the first ones to want to implement it.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Totally. I
 
mean, there are some breakthroughs that I think are 
achievable. They're confidential, so I can't talk about them on this call, but 
there's one particular avenue that I'm confident could be made to work. That 
would be fairly 

 
the most significant one brea
kthrough in a while.
 
But, again, you got to make it work in the lab. It doesn't yet work in the lab, 
it's promising in the lab, a year from the lab to small production. Then you 
go to large production then you get to cost optimization, these are several 
ye
ars, okay? I wish it were shorter. That's the way it goes. Sorry about that. 
Yes. So was there 
-
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The 25% Model 3 gross margin target, when will we get there?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, so, Deepak want to elaborate on this, but I feel like the point which we 
are at steady
-
state 5,000 units a week for Model 3 is about when we reach 
the 25% gross margin level. So it wouldn't be right when we get to 5,000, 
because initially when you get
 
to 5,000 a week there's still a lot of overtime. 
We're still expediting parts from all around the world. So you've got a lot of 
expedited fees, you've got a lot overtime, and so it takes probably from the 
point at which you get to the 5,000 a week, it's p
robably another three or 
four months before you hit the 25% gross margin. Would you agree 
Deepak?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I agree. Yes, I was just going to be more cautious...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's something like that. It's certainly...
 
Dee
pak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You need to reach a production level and then optimize at that production 
level.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, I think ultimately it's a variety of factors including material cost and sell 
and th
e efficiencies to achieve at the Gigafactory on ourselves. And we are 
very confident we will achieve the 25% target, seriously on Model 3.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
For sure, next year. 100%.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
That's right. It's a question exa
ctly when.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Again. I'd say 100% probability achieving that at some point next year
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, and I feel really good about it because the bill of material that we have 
is so well defined and so 
clear in our...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The premiums that we have on prototypes is...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Another way of saying, we're significantly less dumb this time, we think.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Yes. The labor hours required are significantly lower. The way we have 
structured the manufactured...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's designed for manufacturing.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly. So all of those gives me much more confidence in t
his target. And 
exactly when we'll achieve? I think we'll give you more clarity over time.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, and I'd like to give some credit to our suppliers here.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
With Roadste
r and certainly with Model S and to a slight less degree with 
Model X, we often could not get the top suppliers, and we certainly couldn't 
get the A
-
team at the top suppliers.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
What's great abo
ut the Model 3 is we have the A supplier, and we have the A 
supplier and we have the A
-
team at the A supplier. I can't tell you how 
important this is. It makes a massive difference.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So just a 
thank you to all the suppliers that work so hard to get us to this 
point. There is a lot of credit for any success that we have.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Next question. Shree.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question co
mes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about your liquidity 
position, while you're operating with more cash than you historically have, 
$3 billion, I see you're also
 
guiding the $2 billion CapEx in the back half, and 
you've previously said $1 billion of gross cash is as low as you're 
comfortable operating at. So are you guiding to positive cash from 
operations in the back half, presumably on the Model 3 ramp in 4Q. Bu
t if 
it's only a little positive, then I guess you would be close to your target at 
cash level.
 
So the question is, can you help us size up how positive do you expect the 
cash from operations to be in the back half? And if that level of cash from 
operation
s plus whatever remains available to draw on your asset backed 
line, if that's sufficient cushion for you relative to your $1 billion target? Or 
whether it might make sense to do another equity raise?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Deepak, do you 
want to...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. Sure, Elon. So we expect our operating cash flows to be significantly 
better in the second half compared to the first half.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
At the highest level, scal
ing generates cash.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Absolutely, it does.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And it's a better situation than S and X. And our cash conversion cycle, 
particularly for the next four quarters, is going be really great while we're 
s
hipping Model 3s in North America. And...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. And one thing perhaps we're trying to get to it is, is that with Model 3, 
with our suppliers we've been able to get 

 
negotiate much better terms, 
payment terms. But the payment t
erms are significantly longer. So I think 
we're close to...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Close to 60, exactly.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Close to 60 days.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Payments to those of our suppliers 
(43:21). And we were also able to make 
the car a lot faster. So obviously, the Nirvana is that we can make the car 
and get paid for the car before we have to pay our suppliers, which then the 
faster you grow, the faster your cash position grows. Obviously,
 
that's like 
the 

 
that's the promised land right there. And that's how 

 
it's what we've 
aimed for. And I think we'll achieve that maybe not immediately but pretty 
quickly.
 
And now that said, there may be some wisdom in having a cash cushion for 
unexpecte
d events. You just never know if there's going be some significant 
force majeure events in the world. It could be an earthquake in California, 
for example. But we're not at this point considering an equity raise. We are 
thinking about debt, but we're not t
hinking about an equity raise.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. That's very helpful. And then just the follow
-
up is about the $1 billion 
of desired minimum gross cash. Does that go up when the Model 3 launches 
because you're a bigger company o
r does it go down because of what you 
just said about the ability to generate cash and working capital while 
production's ramping?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
In the long run as we go up as our balance sheet grows. And just to finish 
off on your question, w
e also have liquidity through the lines of credit, our 
ABL line.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We've just grown it to $1.9 billion. We have untapped $800 million there. Of 
course, how much we can tap there depends on our 
borrowing base, but 
that's a source of liquidity. And then for our solar lease assets, we have 
$700 million of funding, which is untapped on our tax equity funds and 
application debt (45:21). So we have significant amounts of liquidity we get 
from those li
nes too.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Yes. Very helpful. Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
One side for this (45:29) is this, as far as people look at our finished goods 
inventory and compare that to other car companies, they compare it i
n the 
wrong way. Because Tesla does direct distribution, we are the dealers. You 
really 

 
to accurately compare Tesla to other car companies, you must 
include the finished goods inventory, not just at the car companies but at 
the dealers. And typically tha
t combined time of finished goods from 
manufacture all the way through to dealer to end customer is, I believe, on 
the order of 90 days. So maybe 70 to 90 days.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
For other OEMs.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
For the other, OEMs.
 
D
eepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. And for us that same metric would be approximately 30 days. So this is 
a 

 
in other words, at a systemic level, we're substantially more efficient 
than other carmakers when you 
consider the system as a whole.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay. Shree, let's have the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hi. Just a co
uple quick ones. First on safety. Elon, you're putting a liquid 
cooled supercomputer in all of your cars. You're obviously ramping up more 
and more of those. Whether the system is being activated or not, it's 
collecting data, learning, you're getting bette
r every mile. I imagine you're in 
a position to kind of share that data with the public or the regulators or 
Congress, whoever, where it matters. I've even seen an announcement 
since the 40% reduction in accidents from NHTSA back in January. When 
could we 
be in a position to hear some more on this?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's true that there is an enormous amount of sort of visual data being 
gathered. It's actually quite a challenge to process that data and then train 
against that data and have the v
ehicle learn effectively from data, because 
it's just a vast quantity of data. I do want to emphasize that this is 
disaggregated from a specific vehicle. So we're always on the side of the 
owner of the car and do whatever is possible within bounds of the l
aw to 
protect privacy. But I don't have a good answer for you. If I have good 
answer right now. I spend a lot of my week working on Autopilot, with the 
Autopilot team. Wright down in the trenches, the individual details of how 
we can improve this or that o
r enhanced in your math (48:27), enhanced 
vision and advanced improved control.
 
And I think the release that should go out soon is, I think people were really 
pleased with it. And it's going to get better from there. Yes. Yes. Obviously, 
over time, an auto
nomous vehicle is going to be far, far safer than a person. 
Yes. It's really hard for a person to compete. I mean, the car has eight 
cameras looking 360 degrees all the time. It's got a (49:12) radar. It's got 
12 high
-
precision ultrasonic sonars. It's got 
initial measurement units, so 
high
-
accuracy GPS, and over 10 Teraops of computing capability that never 
sleeps.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Okay. Elon, just a follow
-
up then on space, but not on Mars but more Earth, 
in Earth (49:39)

Oh, God. Come on, looks like it gets (49:39)
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
No. It's actually 

 
it's really relevant. I was just curious if 

 
is there anything 
that SpaceX is doing that we're enabling that could be 
advantageous to 
Tesla's mission to accelerate sustainable transport?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
There's a recent anecdote, actually, that Jon just shared with me. And, Jon, 
maybe you...
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. There's some really great colla
boration continuously between the 
SpaceX teams on materials and other challenges. And we had a challenge in 
service over the past 

 
just over the past week.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Just this is X
-
factor (50:15).
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
El
on Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Just told about this today.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Where we needed to determine the ferocity of an object deep within our 
structure and that's something that SpaceX...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Aluminum casting?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Is an aluminum casting. That's something that SpaceX knows how to do. 
Our team reached out to the SpaceX team. The SpaceX team helped us to 
solve that with some ultrasound sensors that we could quickly isolate where 
the issu
e was and take corrective action in it.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It saved us eight hours of work per car.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Per car. That was kind of 

 
that could potentially experience this issue. And 
that's just one example of a lot of 
examples of how the SpaceX team and 
the Tesla team collaborate, and we get help from them continually on 
material issues and other issues like that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. That's cross
-
fertilization of knowledge from the rocket and space 
indust
ry to auto back and forth, as I think it's really been quite valuable. It's 
certainly been very valuable for me in thinking about how do we make 
mass
-
optimized vehicles because space 

 
mass optimization (51:25) is 
extremely important on the space side. It'
s helpful because what really goes 
into high
-
volume manufacturing of something that has to be extremely 
reliable. So it's been good. And, of course, companies are competing 
anyway, so it's been quite helpful, actually.

Shre
e, next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.
 
Colin Langan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. How do you come up with your 
estimate for the number of Supercharges and sealers that you need because 
you're doubling the number of the base, the number of Supercharges going 
into the release? But these three is g
oing to have multiple higher in terms of 
demand. So, I mean, how do you frame that and engage that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. First of all, I will actually clarify that the numbers of charges will in fact 
triple between now and the end of next yea
r. And we're confident that that 
will address the supercharging needs of S, X and 3. So we'll try to stay 
ahead of it. There are occasional places where 

 
that are tricky to find a 
location, like Malibu's really difficult. There are a few places, but the 

 
we're 
staying ahead of that. I think it's going to be good.
 
We should see some immediate relief even for S and X customers on some 
of the key supercharge locations whilst we 

 
experimenting with our first 
sort of 

 
I don't know what we call it 

 
mega supe
rcharging location, like 
really big supercharging location with a bunch of amenities. So we're going 
to unveil the first of those relatively soon. And I think we'll get a sense for 
just sort of how cool it can be to have a great place to 

 
if you've been 
d
riving for three, four hours 

 
stop, have great restrooms, great food, 
amenities, hang out and for half an hour and then be on your way.
 
Colin Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
If I could just follow
-
up with a related question...
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
M
aybe just one other point on that and how this can scale pretty effectually. 
We have Superchargers that serve two major separate needs. There's long 
distance root enabling between cities, and then there's also within the cities. 
And while there are definit
ely some congestion issues which we're expanding 
out of very quickly in the cities, for the most part the Superchargers that are 
in between cities have a lot of extra capacity. And we've put those stations 
in place to serve travel between the cities, but t
hey can absorb a lot more 
cars.
 
So even if we double fleet size, it doesn't mean that we need to double the 
entire Supercharger network. We have to address the few urban sites that 
are currently in high use, but that can be done much more effectually with 
less CapEx. So that's kind of what you're seeing.
 
Colin Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
And what about, just as a follow
-
up, the charge time? I know Porsche has 
said that they could charge in 15 minutes. Do you think that's possible in the 
future? And is the c
harge time on the 3 the same as the S? I wasn't sure in 
some of the release.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's about the same. It's comparable to the high
-
end S. The recharge rate of 
how many miles per hour you recharge is sort of a function of the batter
y 
pack size. So, like a 100 kilowatt
-
hour pack, because charge rate is a 
function of percentage of pack 

 
think of 3 and a high end S as being similar 
in charge rates.
 
And over time, we want to keep moving that rate up, but one thing I want to 
correct from
 
Friday 

 
I don't think it really has much materiality, but I did 
misspeak at the Journalist Review on Friday. I had said that there were 
500,000 net reservations. I did also say that I wasn't sure because I don't 
follow this number, and this was just a gu
ess. And so we did check to get 
some precision on this.
 
So to be more accurate, there have been 518,000 gross reservations for 3, 
and we have 455,000 net reservations. But those cancellations occurred 
over the course of more than a year. The net gain since
 
Friday, net of 
cancellations, has been over 1,800 per day.
 
But I just didn't want to leave people with the wrong impression. I think this 
is inconsequential because with a small amount of effort we could easily 
drive the Model 3 reservation number to some
thing much higher, but there's 
no point. It's like if you're a restaurant and you're serving hamburgers and 
there's an hour and a half wait for the hamburger, do you really want to 
encourage more people to come order hamburgers? It doesn't make sense. 
So I
 
think it's neither here nor there, but I wanted to make sure there was 
not a misunderstanding.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And maybe just one quick point on your very fast charge time comment or 
question. We've actually tested cells and even full batte
ry packs that can do 
something like a 15 minute recharge, but to date the tradeoffs to achieve 
that we don't feel are the right ones for the customer overall.
 
You end up sacrificing on overall cost per kilowatt
-
hour and also sacrificing 
on energy density i
n the product, and for something that's used not every 
single day, not every single charge, we feel that we've hit the sweet spot in 
terms of the value to the customer and the best product. And that's kind of 
what's guided our philosophy, but obviously the
re's ongoing work to reduce 
those tradeoffs and make it better still, but yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
And particularly (58:07) 310
-
mile range for Model 3, let me tell you, the 
amount of times you will have range anxiety is zero. You don't even think
 
about it.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

All right. Shree, next question?
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. I have one question and one follow
-
up
 
as well, please. In 
terms of the Model 3, at the delivery event, 20 of the units were for 
engineering validation. And the first several thousand it appears are going to 
be going to employees prior to going to the general public. So I guess the 
question is
, what are you hoping to learn or what might you learn from 
these engineering validation units that have come out from your employees? 
And then, realistically, what's (59:04)?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
They're not engineering validation. They're 
fully
-
certified, fully
-
DOT
-
approved, EPA
-
approved production cars. These are not prototypes in any 
way. They're not validation anything. They're full
-
production cars. The 
reason they are initially going to employees, and some cases, investors, or 
anyone ha
s been a long
-
time investor is that for the first several thousand 
vehicles, there are problems that crop up that are rare.
 
On a percentage basis, they might be like 0.1% likely to occur. But then 
there are a whole bunch of these things that only show up 1
 
in 1,000 cases. 
And it's good to iron out these things with a (59:59) than to with customers. 
It also (60:05) reward for those who work on the underlying development 
and creation of the vehicle. Yes. Yes.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean, it's import
ant to note too that all those people paid full price for 
their car.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Full price. There was no discount internally at all.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Righ
t. No. I mean, the root of the question is if you realistically uncover 
something and even if it's 1 in 1,000, what flexibility do you think you have 
to actually be able to rectify that concern in a way that won't impact your 
ramp? And if this is being don
e arguably later in the process than a 
traditional OEM, that's not trying to ramp necessarily as aggressively as you 
need to, I'm, again, just trying to understand realistically what can be done 
and what kinds of things, like perhaps you can give an exampl
e of what you 
might uncover and what the rectification might be?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. These are not (61:13), obviously. These are 

 
what we're talking about 
here are inconsistencies in the production process or in the quality control 
from a s
upplier. So they're relatively easy to correct. They tend to be quite a 
large number of them. But, again, only rarely occurring. Usually, it involves 
like a tolerance stack up, or some combination of factors that we didn't 
anticipate, but they're almost al
ways very easy to correct, but there's just a 
bunch of them. It's a lot of work.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. And these may be software issues, as well.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Exactly.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Not 
necessarily supplier or hardware issues.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. It's software
-
hardware interaction as well. Yes.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And I think the main benefit is that we can learn about them faster and 
therefore we can fix them fa
ster. That simply is the benefit.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right. Exactly. The people driving them are the same ones who actually fix 
the problem. It's a great feedback loop.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And what we're doing is above and beyond others. 
We've done a lot of 
testing like the other OEMs. So this is just helping us get above and beyond 
by selling it to our employees and getting feedback from them.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And investors.
 
Deepak Ahuja

Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Yes.

Our next question is from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Hey. Thank you. Thanks for updating with the net reservation number. 
Actually,
 
I want to follow along those lines on your order rates. You've given 
us additional color based off of 2Q trends and average weekly orders. Can 
you share a little bit more maybe what the 1Q and 2Q order rate trends look 
like for the Model S and the X?
 
Deep
ak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Not relevant.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I don't think that those numbers would be helpful for producing things in the 
future. And like once you get into the granularity, people read things into 
numbers that really don't have a l
ot of relevance. There's for sure 
seasonality in vehicle orders. Fewer people order cars in the dead of winter 
than order them in spring or summer. So just like other retailers really.
 
And then we do batch cars, so that we'll make typically at the beginnin
g of 
the quarter, we'll make cars for Europe and Asia. And then we'll make cars 
for the East Coast of North America then the West Coast of North America. 
And that's generally sequence within a quarter. Then you'll see someone, 
right, something where they t
hink they've uncovered some gotcha where 
there were very few Tesla's registered in the given country in a particular 
month, I guess because none of them arrived. So this is meaningless 
extrapolation.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Then I 
guess my follow
-
up question will just be on your 3Q gross 
margin guidance of a dip below 20%. How far below 

 
to phrase correctly, 
how dependent upon production and hitting an S curve or ramping up do 
you think that below 20% is? Could it be a couple hundr
ed basis points 
below 20%, or is it just you think you're going be around that area based on 
what the curve that you've laid out so far is going to look like?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. This is just because of Model 3 is fundamentally negative gros
s margin 
in the very beginning. Because you got a gigantic machine producing 

 
meant for 5,000 vehicles a week. And it's producing a few hundred vehicles 
a week.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly, that's the short explanation.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, In
c.
 
I mean, it's a denominator problem.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Yes. Looking back, probably something fundamentally wrong with the...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. It's a temporary situation, and it's a dip which corrects itself.
 
Elon Reeve Mus
k 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
This is true for anything. If you had like a soap factory, let me tell you, your 
first bar of soap would be like millions of dollars. Okay. But then you get to 
volume production, and then it's like $2. Okay? So true for any 
manufacturing si
tuation. Yes.

Okay.

-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You're a bit soft but go ahead.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes. Just wanted to ask about 

 
a couple questions around the pace of spend 
in the second half...
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Please speak up. You're a
 
bit soft. Yes.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes. The pace of OpEx through second half you guided through flat. With the 
Model 3 going out, are you basically saying you have the operating 
infrastructure to handle that but then does that ramp i
n 2018? And similarly 
for CapEx to go from 30 Model 3s up to the exit rate, you're talking $2 
billion. How do we think about, A, that run rate and given how do we tie it to 
your exponential ramp? And, B, what does that imply for CapEx going into 
2018?
 
Deep
ak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. So, your first question was operating expenses?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And do we have enough infrastructure in place to service the Model 3. And I 
think, yes, we're finding actually leverage in our own infrastructure and
 
that's helping us. So I'll give you an example of that. In service, as we've 
talked about, we discovered that 80% of the cars that we repair don't 
require lift. And so we're deploying a mobile service strategy to take 80% of 
the cars and fix them where it
's convenient to the customer. Not at our 
location but their location. Make it invisible to them.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly. The 

 
the nice thing 

 
you 

 
like the ideal service is it's invisible. 
You don't even notice it, and when it's 
done, you love it. So what we're 
talking about here the mobile service tracks. As Jon was saying, really most 
of the time we don't really need a lift. Is that your car could be parked and it 
could be at your office parking lot or at your house. But let's s
ay it's at work. 
Tesla will come there, fix your car and by the time you need to leave for 
work, it's done.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
That's right. And so what that does for us is it takes 80% of the volume out 
of our existing footprint and allows us 
to leverage that footprint to grow with 
Model 3. And we'll give you similar examples in stores. So that's why we've 
guided to the OpEx. We've guided for the second half. We feel like we've got 
leverage there, and we've got plans in place to further lever t
hat in 2018.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think it's been really great for customers. I mean this is what you want.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Totally.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean, you don't want to bring your cars at your service 
center. You just 
want your car to be magically fixed in the parking lot and that's what we're 
going to do.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. So we're going to provide really great customer happiness at increasing 
OpEx levels of leverage.
 
Brian A. Johnson
 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
And second question was similarly around CapEx leverage. So you put in $2 
billion second half to get to that exit rate. One, is that affected by the timing 
of Elon's production ramp? And then, two, keeping the ramp from 5,000 to 
1
0,000 in 2018, what's your preliminary view of CapEx for 2018?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So I want to put a pin on 2018. We'll talk about that when we get to that 
time. But in 2017, our CapEx expense is a continuum. There are long
-
lead 
items of different 
kinds likely the Gigafactory. And for the Model 3 and the 
equipment we are buying, our CapEx spend is at historical highs. We're 
spending $100 million a week. So a week or two here or there is a couple of 
hundred million. So what we are spending now is the
 
completion of all of our 
Model 3 equipment and tooling, as that gets signed off. And it's taking us to 
5,000 and beyond. So I can't necessarily break it out for you, but it just 
allows us to hit our operating plan that we have at a high level.
 
Jeffrey K. 
Evanson 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I want to do a quick time check here. So some of us have some other things 
scheduled in 20 minutes. So we've gotten some good thorough answers 
here, so we'll probably take a few more questions.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-

Yes. Few q
uestions, and yes.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
 
Colin 
Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit about the conversion rate of 
customers coming into stores and actually ordering cars? And then, similar 
question on what's happening with solar and energy storage in terms of how 
man
y customer impressions you've got, and the conversion rate into actual 
sales?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The conversion rates have continued to improve quarter
-
over
-
quarter and 
month after month, our conversion rates get stronger. And we don't 
obviousl
y publicize specifics on those, but they're improving with every week 
and every month. On the solar side, one of the interesting things that we're 
seeing is we've put a solar display and an energy display into our stores in 
North America. And we've got ene
rgy experts that are on staff. And what 
we're finding is it's a really natural transition in conversation from somebody 
is buying a car and talking about where they're going to charge the car to 
then where their energy comes from.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, 
Inc.
 
Yes. Totally. I mean, we talked about the importance of integrating energy, 
production, storage and electric vehicle transport. And what we said is 
coming true. It's really working well together. And we're actually able to 
leverage our existing stores
 
to generate even more sales per square foot. 
I'm not sure what our 

 
I think our sales per square foot...
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Our sales per square foot is so high 
-
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 

 
are so high 
-
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It
 
actually moves the total number of...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You need a telescope to see who's in second place.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Exactly. Yes. And it actually moves the overall...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's like stupidly 
high.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Square footage, sales
-
per
-
square
-
foot numbers for some of the larger 
(71:45).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
But, I mean, (71:50) Model 3, because there's no point there, but (71:54) 
eventually. And I think that the new 
integrated app, with where you can see 
the status of your car, your power wall, and your solar, and see at any given 
time of the day how much energy is coming from the sun, how much from is 
coming from the power wall, what your house is consuming.
 
You can 
also 

 
it tells you when the power wall saved you from utility 
interruption. People don't realize they're like there are many small utility 
interruptions in a given month. And that's why you're 

 
you see the blinking 
12 on your microwave oven or whatever t
he case may be, or your computer 
suddenly went dark or you can even get data corruption and that kind of 
thing, or your food went bad mysteriously. The power wall saves you from 
all of that.
 
And I think it's particularly important in cases where there's li
ke a natural 
disaster, which could be floods, hurricanes, ice storms, earthquakes, fires, 
anything that disrupts the utility system. But having an uninterruptible 
power supply in the form of power wall gives you security in those 
situations. And it's kind 
of like insurance, like you only really want it when 
you really want it. And I think people love that. I just saw the app for the 
first time today. I'm using it myself and it's like, wow, this is great.

Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Hey. This is Martin. I have just two very quick questions. The first one is on 
the battery production for S and X. Is 
there any plan to move it to the 
Gigafactory?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
For pack production.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(74:07) production? We do not 

 
in the short term, we will not be moving it. 
So someti
me next year, we may move it sometime next year in order to 
make space for additional production volume of Model 3. That's one of the 
things under consideration. But in the short term we're keeping it here in 
Fremont. But it is going be tricky to squeeze i
n all the space for increased 
Model 3 production. Particularly, if that run rate goes above 10,000 units a 
week then we're going to have to move more stuff out.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. And it may just be worth a reminder also that the cells for
 
S and X are 
actually still 18
-
650 lithium
-
ion and those are coming from a different 
production pathway in Japan. Very similar technology. Yes. Almost same 
technology.

platform or very s
imilar platform as the Model 3.

We're going to aim for maximum carryover.

Re
dburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Okay. I mean, just one thing to clarify is this still going to be the 100 meters 
of cables which you touched upon last time? Or actual it's going to be the 
next generation of vehicles?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No, that's one of the
 
things that we would include. We would aim to switch 
out the wiring on this for 

 
the one that coming is wiring on is for a 
redundant flex circuit. That's on more in the order of 100 meters or so. But 
then we'd, obviously, aim to do that both for the Y, i
f it's called a Y and the 
Model 3 as well.

Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Yes. Hi. 
Thanks. Just one for me. I was wondering the degree to which Tesla 
would eventually consider maybe charging more for, I guess, what you 
would call nontraditional product offerings? Things like software, over
-
the
-
air 
updates, but also shared mobility, super
charging, aftermarket. I know in the 
past you've talked about running a lot of those businesses just to breakeven, 
but I guess maybe just wondering the circumstances under which you would 
consider trying to earn a margin on some of these businesses versus 
situations where you'd prefer to just give them away?

Well, I think we have a major element of that which is the Autopilot. That's a 
software. That's basically uploading software to the car. Every car made 
since October last y
ear is capable of full autonomy we believe. And such 
really just a question of uploading the software for autonomy. There will be 
some other things I think in the future. But I 

 
and our focus is in the Model 
3 ramp and we don't want to get too distracted.
 
Maybe one more question.

All right. Shree, one last question, please.

Our final question comes from Rob Cihra from Guggenheim Partners.

Hi. Great. Thanks very much. Just go
ing back to Autopilot development, 
obviously not talking personal details or anything but you had some 
personnel changes in the quarter. I'm just wondering if those reflected any 
kind of change of strategy or scope, or if it was just kind of a personal thi
ng? 
And I guess just related, are you still hoping to be able to do the 
autonomous drive L.A. to New York by the end of this year? Thank you.

Yes. I may not comment too much on like individual personnel changes, but 
Tesla is 3

person company. If you actually look at our executive tenure 
at Tesla, it's extremely good. It's above average. I think we're at least 
maybe a year or two above average in terms of executive tenure here.
 
Every now and then something doesn't work out 
for one reason or another. 
In the case of Autopilot, it's very centrally about vision and image 
recognition, neural nets, effectively narrow AI. And so, that's the focus from 
our recruiting standpoint, and I think we've really got 

 
I think we've got the 
b
est team in the world by a long shot on that front, and we are growing it 
rapidly with world
-
class talent.
 
And then, the coast
-
to
-
coast drive, autonomous drive by the end of the 
year, I believe we're still on track for that. It is certainly possible that I
 
may 
have egg on my face on that front. But if it is not, at the end of the year, it 
will be very close.

10/28/16,Tesla,"Thank you, Latiff, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's third 
quarter 2017 Q&A webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk; JB Straubel; 
Deepak Ahuja; and Jon McNeill. Our third quarter results were previously 
announced in the update letter we 
published at the same link as this 
webcast.
 
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward
-
looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and 
expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ material
ly due 
to a number of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in our most 
recent filings with the SEC.
 
During the question
-
and
-
answer portion of today's call, please limit 
yourselves to one question and one follow
-
up, so we can get to everybody i
n 
the queue.
 
Before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
So, sorry, one minute, I have a bit of a cold, so, yes I'm actually 

 
we're 
doing this call from the Gigafactory because that's where the 
production 
constraint is for Model 3, the most important thing for the company, and I 
always move my desk to wherever 

 
well, I don't really have a desk, 
actually. I move myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla, so I'm 
at 

 
I really believe that
 
one should lead from the front lines and that's why 
I'm here.
 
I will go into some of the Gigafactory issues later in the call, but I'd like to 
start off by acknowledging some I think pretty amazing milestones for Tesla. 
One thing that I thought was really
 
profound was that we surpassed 
cumulative deliveries of vehicles. We surpassed a 0.25 million cumulative 
deliveries since the company's inception and had record Model S and Model 
X net orders and deliveries last quarter, so things are really going quite w
ell.
 
To put that into perspective, five years ago we had only delivered 2500 cars, 
so the Tesla fleet has grown by a factor of 100 in five years. I would expect 
five years from now to be at least an order of magnitude beyond where we 
are right now and poss
ibly even close to two orders of (3:34) magnitude. 
But for the skeptics out there, I'd like to say 

 
ask them which one of you 
predicted that Tesla would go from 2500 units delivered to 250,000 units 
delivered now. I suspect the answer is zero.
 
So consider
 
your assumptions for the future and whether they're valid or 
perhaps pessimistic.
 
So for Model 3, we continue to make significant progress each week. We've 
had no problems with our supply chain or any of our production processes. 
Obviously, there are bott
lenecks. There are thousands of processes in 
creating the Model 3, and we will move as fast as the slowest and least lucky 
process among those thousands.
 
In fact, there's 10,000 unique parts, so to be more accurate, there're tens of 
thousands of processes 
necessary to produce the car. We will move as fast 
as the least competent and least lucky elements of that mixture. So while 
the vast majority are going incredibly well, there are some problem areas. 
After I give the business overview, I'll do a deep dive 
into the biggest 
problem area.
 
So, based on what we know now as we've gotten really into the details of 
some of the worst bottlenecks, we expect to achieve a production rate of 
5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by late Q1 2018, so probably sometime in 
March.
 
I think in the grand scheme of things this is a relatively small shift, 
the Model 3 is a 10
-
year program, and so we're talking about a few months 
out of a 10
-
year program. It's in the grand scheme of things (5:53) net 
present value calculation, this is im
material.
 
And we have a clear path to that. We understand the bottlenecks. It's 
difficult to fully understand these things but we actually try to do them. And 
it's worth noting that some of our manufacturing areas we're actually seeing 
capabilities that we
 
estimate in the 6,000 unit to 7,000 unit per week 
capability, well in excess of the 5,000 unit capability and we're optimistic 
with further optimization that many of our production processes will meet 
very little and in some cases no, so I'm not saying no
, but almost no CapEx 
to reach something close to 10,000 units a week.
 
It's remarkable how much can be done by just beating up robots, shortening 
the path, intensifying (7:05) the factory, adding additional robots at choke 
points and just making lines go r
eally, really fast. Speed is the ultimate 
weapon. And the design intent of the Model 3 being that its design 
manufacturability is turning out to be accurate, it is far easier to build this 
car than a Model S, and vastly easier than a Model X.
 
The primary p
roduction constraint really, by far, is in battery module 
assembly. So a little bit of a deep dive on that. There are four zones to 
module manufacturing it goes through four major production zones. The 
zones three and four are in good shape, zones one and 
two are not. Zone 
two in particular, we had a subcontractor, a systems integration 
subcontractor, that unfortunately really dropped the ball, and we did not 
realize the degree to which the ball was dropped until quite recently, and 
this is a very complex m
anufacturing area. We had to rewrite all of the 
software from scratch, and redo many of the mechanical and electrical 
elements of zone two of module production.
 
We've managed to rewrite what was about 20 to 30 man years of software 
in four weeks, but there
's still a long way to go. Because the software 
working with the electromechanical elements need to be fabricated and 
installed, and getting those atoms in place and rebuilt is, unfortunately, a lot 
longer, and has far more external constraints, than softw
are.
 
This is where I spent many a late night on the Gigafactory working on. JB 
has been here constantly, and we reallocated many of our best engineers to 
fundamentally fixing zone two of the module line, and then (10:05) is zone 
one.
 
On the plus side, we n
ow have a very detailed understanding of what is 
necessary to fix zone one and zone two. We also have a new design for zone 
one and two that is about three times more effective than the car design. So 
when we put in 

 
and there are three lines of module pr
oduction. Lines one, 
two, and three are essentially identical.
 
Line 4, which will be the new design, will be at triple the effectiveness of 

 
will be as good as the other three lines combined. So we're very confident 
about a future path of having incredibl
y efficient production of modules, and 
that this will not be a constraint in the future but, unfortunately, it just takes 
some amount of time. This is like moving like lightning compared to what is 
normal in the automotive industry. There's still some fini
te amount of time 
necessary to fix something that we thought was in good shape. We were told 
by our supplier it was in good shape, but was really not. So this has now 
been classified (11:31) Tesla's internal automation group in the U.S. 

 
and 
Tesla Automat
ion U.S. and Tesla Grohmann from Germany, we have a large 
team from Tesla Grohmann also working the issue, and making very rapid 
progress.
 
And like I said, I am personally on that line, in that machine, (11:57) 
personally where I can. And JB is basically s
pending his life at the 
Gigafactory. So that's the sort of deep dive on that front.
 
The other thing I want to mention, there are a lot of articles about Tesla 
firing employees and layoffs (12:20), these are really ridiculous. And any 
journalist who has wri
tten articles to this effect should be ashamed of 
themselves for lack of journalistic integrity. Every company in the world, 
there's annual performance reviews. In our annual performance review, 
despite Tesla having an extremely high standard, a standard f
ar higher than 
other car companies, which we need to have in order to survive against 
much larger car companies; you can't be a little guy and have equal levels of 
skill as the big guy.
 
If you have two boxers of equal ability and one's much smaller, the bi
g guy's 
going to crush the little guy, obviously. So little guy better have heck of a lot 
more skill, and that is why 

 
or he (13:11) is going to clobbered. So that is 
why our standards are high. They're not high because we believe in being 
mean to people.
 
They're high because, if they're not high, we will die. 
Despite that, in our annual performance reviews, only 2% of people didn't 
make the grade. So that's about 700 people out of 33,000. This is a very low 
percentage. GE, I don't know if they still do, b
ut they certainly for a long 
time had a policy of firing 10% of their employees performance every year, 
no matter what.
 
If you were to stack Tesla's performance later releases compared to other 
companies, the number would be low. So the only reason these a
rticles had 
any play whatsoever is because journalists and editors with low integrity, 
they'll provide any context for where they stood (14:11) because the actual 
article would've read, Tesla fires 2% of its employee base for performance
-
based reasons, a r
emarkably lower number compared to other companies. 
But of course, that would be a meaningless article, so they forget to include 
that. Shame. And then also, it was not reported that several thousand 
employees were promoted, and almost half those promotion
s were in 
manufacturing.
 
Right. I think, let's move to questions.

Our first question comes from the line of James Albertine of 
Consumer Edge. 
Your line is open.

Great. Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I wanted to ask with 
respect to 

 
and Elon, thank you for doing the deeper dive into the zones 
and the bottlenecks. How does thi
s change the trajectory or does it change 
the trajectory from a margin perspective on the Model 3? And then maybe 
as an aside, can you tell us where you are today on a production per week 
basis and where you expect to be by the end of 2017, just so we can 
get an 
idea of the ramp? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
I don't want to go into like the week by week stuff. The reason it's tricky is 
because people just read too much into it. The ramp curve is a step 
exponential, so it means like as you alleviate
 
a constraint, the production 
suddenly jumps to a much higher number. And so, although it looks a little 
staggered if you sort of zoom out, that production ramp is exponential with 
week over week increases.
 
I'd like to state a number at the end of Q4, but 
there's too much uncertainty 
right now to give that with any precision. Now I do feel confident about the 
end of Q1, maybe sooner. But really, we're like in a vertical climb here. So 
it's really hard to say. Yeah.

Yeah. In the thousands by the end of the year. But where exactly, it's hard 
to say. And literally, if you move the calendar by, like, two or three weeks, 
you would see giant changes. So the quarter
-
to
-
date will fall somewhat so
rt 
of arbitrarily in that exponential curve. So even in a matter of a few weeks 
which would show a very different number (17:53) people tend to 
extrapolate on a linear basis instead of an exponential. In fact, most people 
wouldn't know what exponential is.
 
So (18:07) is it tends to be a straight
-
line extrapolation, but really on a very 
steep exponential. So it's really an S
-
curve. Yeah. So it starts off really slow 
and then it ramps very rapidly on an exponential basis. It does start to go 
sort of linear ri
ght in the middle and then it sort of asymptotes off at the 
target production capacity, really target a whole supply chain or factory for a 
given production capacity. And yeah, trying (18:41) possible. We're highly 
confident of the long
-
term margin number 
of 25% or higher for Model 3. 
Deepak, I mean...
 
Deepak Ahuja

Yeah. None of our projections in terms of our material cost or 
manufacturing, legal and overhead or depreciation or the other elements 
have changed as a result of these last few mon

Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. 
Your line is open.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks everybody. Just one question, one follow
-
up. Elon, you described 
Model 3, the Mode
l 3 launch as production hell. I mean, you have a cold, but 
how hot is it in hell right now? And is it getting hotter or less hot? I mean, 
are we solving more problems than are coming up?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean, (19:41) emphasize what each le
vel means really, but let's say level 
9 is the worst, okay? Well, we're in level 9. We're now in level 8 and I think 
we're close to exiting level 8. I thought we could probably be more like a 
level 7 by now and I have to tell you, I was really depressed ab
out 3 or 4 
weeks ago when I realized that we're kind of in level 9, then we got to level 
8, now I can see sort of a clear path to sunshine. And so I feel really pretty 
optimistic right now. If you talked to me 3 weeks ago, I would have been 
quite pessimist
ic and I was sort of quite down in the dumps.
 
But now it's pretty obvious what we need to do. It's just a matter of work to 
get there, working seven days a week to do it. And I have personally 
(20:39) zone 2 module line at 2:00 AM on a Sunday morning helpi
ng 
diagnose robot calibration issues. So I'm doing everything I can. JB is doing 
everything he can. The whole team is on it, we're on it. And we are on it, 
we've got it covered, it's going to take us a few months longer than we 
expected.

Got it. Just one follow
-
up for Deepak. On the secured bonds due 2025 the 
issuance from last August, was this meant to be a permanent part of the cap 
structure or is it more a bridge loan to help fund some of the near

a
bsorption issues related to the Model 3 delay and things of that nature? 
Thanks.

It is an eight

capital for that timeframe.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

Tesla, Inc.
 
All righ
t, Latiff. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Tyler Frank of Baird. Your line is open.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Hey. It's Ben Kallo from Baird. Elon, you guys talked a lot about the Model
 
3 
being easier to manufacture than the S and the X. Could you just give us a 
sense about the difference in manufacturing the volume of the three 
compared to basically 10 times the volume that you're trying to get to in the 
near term? Then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. There's vastly more automation with Model 3. Now the tricky thing is 
that when one automation doesn't work, it's really harder to make up for it 
with men and labor. So with S or X, because a lot less that was automate
d, 
we could scale up labor hours and achieve a high level of production. With 
Model 3, it tends to be either the machine works or it doesn't or it's limping 
along and we get short (22:47) quite severely on output. So yes, I mean, JB 
do you want to add?
 
Jef
frey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think you were spot on. The design on the whole is much easier to build 
but it's also intensely automated, which is part of what lets us realize the 
margin and the cost targets. But that does become difficult to bring that 
automation online. That's where we are.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And Doug is on the line, perhaps he can (23:17).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(23:20) maybe cite a few examples.
 
Doug Field 
-
 
Tesla Inc.
 
Sure. The 
number of actual what we call a pitch which is a station for a robot 
to work on the car in general assembly is about one
-
fourth of the typical 
industry average for number of stations it used to build a car. So the way we 
do subassemblies and the care we've
 
taken and designed for manufacturing 
does make it much simpler. But as JB said, each of those stations is fairly 
automated and requires time and engineering to make it work.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
I guess my follow
-
up's on tha
t point. So, in the battery assembly in 
automation, things that you're working through in the software for 
configuring the robots, I'm thinking of this, is it a certain number of man 
hours that have to go into this to get it fixed, or like you know the fix
 
or 
what are you throwing at it right now, is it people or is it a time requirement 
too or all of the above?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, we're throwing a huge amount of people at fixing the machines, and 
then occasionally there's, like, some part o
f a production manufacturing 
process where the machine is permanently broken and then we have to have 
a bypass to a manual operation.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Until we fix the automation.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, until we fix the automatio
n, but that's really 

 
it's really inefficient 
because the system is really not designed for a manual bypass to a (25:11) 
machine or a machine where the software is not right or whatever the case 
may be.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's just an extremel
y...
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Got it.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 

 
extremely complicated machine with combined electrical, mechanical, and 
software challenges. It's not that different than what we do bringing up a 
brand
-
new car.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And a lot of the...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It is harder to supplement with manual than S or X because the system is 
designed as a very tightly in
tegrated automated system. So it's very 
unwieldy to try to supplement or make up for a machine not working with 
manual activity. So, we think like 

 
it's like a 

 
if you had a spreadsheet and 
a couple of cells in the spreadsheet were manually calculated, w
ell, yeah, 
you could still do your spreadsheet stuff, but it's going to be a lot slower, 
until the last cell is automated and then it's going to be super fast.

Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura Instinet. Your line is 
open.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Instinet
 
Great. Thank you and congratulat
ions on the milestone. The competitiveness 
of Autopilot is something that's come up a lot recently, and I just wanted to 
ask about your hardware capabilities. We're actually at a technology 
conference today hosted by NVIDIA and their newest autonomous solu
tion 
according to NVIDIA is 10x more powerful than the version that Tesla is 
using and they're saying they can get you to level 5 autonomy and so along 
those lines the year
-
over
-
year improvement in the NVIDIA board just seems 
really significant, and I was 
just curious Elon if you could just talk about 
what you think you need to do from a hardware perspective to advance 
Autopilot?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, first of all, I think that we will be able to achieve full autonomy with 
the current hardware
. The question is, it's not just full autonomy, but full 
autonomy with what level of reliability, and what will be acceptable to 
regulators. But I feel quite confident that we can achieve human level 

 
approximately human level autonomy with the current co
mputing hardware.
 
Now regulators may require some significant margin above human capability 
in order for a full autonomy to be engaged. They may say, it needs to be 
50% safer, 100% safer, 1000% safer, I don't know. I'm not sure they know 
either. But that's
 

 
but I think I'm confident that we can get to 
approximately human level with our current hardware. And yeah, we'll have 
more to say on the hardware front soon, we're just not ready to say 
anything now. But I feel very optimistic on that front.
 
For custom
ers that have signed up for full software capability, we'll push 
that option. The 

 
if it does turn out that, that a computer upgrade is 
necessary in order to meet the regulatory requirements in that area, we will 
replace the computer with something with g
reater power, which is sort of, 
unplug the old one, plug the new one in. But we feel confident of the 
competitiveness of our hardware strategy. I would say that, we are certain 
that our hardware strategy is better than any other option, by a lot.

strengthened. Can you give us what that actual balance was?

Yeah. So our next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America 
Me
rrill Lynch. Your question please.
 
John Murphy

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Good afternoon. Just a question on quarterly cash flow for the fourth quarter 
and the first quarter. I mean, it sounds like, obviously, there's some delays 
here on the Model 3, 
which is understandable, given the complexity. I'm just 
curious as we think about cash flow for the next two quarters, would we 
think about them relatively similarly to what we just saw in the third 
quarter, plus what you would 

 
whatever you would sell ou
t of inventory, so 
it might be a bit better? I'm just trying to understand, Deepak, how much of 
that $2.5 billion in inventory is finished goods that you might be able to sell 
out of in the fourth quarter?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, firstly, as we co
ntinue to ramp up Model 3, our cash flow from 
operations is going to increase or improve significantly over the next few 
quarters. And it's 

 
this is the positive virtuous cycle of cash flow or working 
capital that Model 3 provides us, because we effective
ly pay our suppliers 
later than we collect from our customers, and also this quarter, our CapEx 
payments will start to decline as we pay off, over the next couple of 
quarters, all the remaining Model 3 related CapEx. So there should be an 
improving trend o
ver the next two quarters, three quarters.
 
John Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
But to be fair, Deepak, I mean, it sounds like this is a little bit more 
uncertain than you thought before, as far as production and delivery. So I'm 
just trying to unde
rstand, what kind of cash you can generate out of the 
inventory that you hold right now?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. So firstly, our inventory is going to come down on S and X, and also, 
what's important is, it is 

 
given these short
-
term delays, we ha
ve to be 
prudent in how we spend our money. And so we are managing our CapEx 
and OpEx growth to be in line with the growth of our fleet. And so, for 
example, CapEx related to our stores or service centers or Superchargers. 
We are slowing that down to be in
 
line, and that's logical of the cargo for 
(32:23) fleet. So all those actions will come through in terms of helping us 
conserve cash.
 
John Murphy

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. I'll follow
-
up with detail later. Thank you.
 
Deepak Ahuja

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Your 
line is open.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just with regard to the ramp
-
up of the 
Model 3 production, I
 
can see what's happening with the 5,000 per week 
target from 1Q to 4Q 

 
or from 

 
now it's 1Q versus 4Q. But I think it's less 
clear, from reading the letter, what's happening with the previous guidance 
of the 10,000 units per week at some point in 2018. 
Is that now like beyond 
2018?
 
I think before, investors were estimating that, if you could hit it at the end of 
2018, you'd do over 250,000 vehicles. If you could hit it more toward the 
middle, you'd do over 325,000. But what now would be a reasonable 
expe
ctation, based upon what you know, for the Model 3s that do get built in 
2018?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's a bit too early to make (33:29). But I mean, if you extrapolate from 
5,000 units towards the end of Q1, we do want to call upon significant Ca
pEx 
until we are confident about cash flow on Model 3, so then that's a question 
of how long it takes to implement. I mean, that's where you get to 10,000 
units a week for Model 3, which is a number we are confident can be 
sustained from a drive (34:01) st
andpoint.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And we want to figure out how much we can push the 5,000 up from the 
existing...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. That's true.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And then learn from those, and figure out, how do we redesign 
whatever we 
do over the next (34:05) spend more efficiently our CapEx. So, it's the right 
thing to do.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly. As we mentioned earlier, we're finding that some parts of the 
line very clearly are capable of 6,000 or 7,00
0 units a week, and maybe 
more than that, just by shortening path length, speeding up the robots, 
adding some robots where the chokepoints exist, simplifying some of the 
processes, and a few minor part redesigns, it's remarkable how much you 
can improve cy
cle time. So...
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. Actually, that's helpful.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Ryan Brinkman

Maybe just as a follow
-
up...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No, go ahead.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPM
organ Securities LLC
 
Oh, I was just going to say, is the gross margin discussion also related to 
this at all? I mean, I see the reduced outlook for 4Q. But do you feel any 
differently about, for example, the ability to do 25% margin when you're 
doing 
kind of 250,000 run rate? And as long as the production is going to be 
restrained, do you have any ability to continue to preference for longer 
maybe the higher
-
margin, higher trim level variance of the Model 3, to help 
with that?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc
.
 
We can fine
-
tune those things when we get there, but overall, our 

 
and I'm 
reinforcing this again, these are all short
-
term issues, and it doesn't change 
our long
-
term prognosis on Model 3 gross margin.
 
Ryan Brinkman

Okay. Grea
t.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

All right. Latiff, let's go to the next questioner, please.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your question 
please.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Yeah, thanks very much. 
I was wondering, I guess, to the extent that these 
production bottlenecks are ultimately somebody else's fault, is it worth your 
time trying to claw back some of the costs that you're presumably incurring 
due to the subcontractor, I guess, dropping the bal
l, as you put it?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. I think, first of all, I think at the end of the day, everything is our fault 

 
and my fault most of all. If we pick the wrong subcontractor, we're the 
fault. So, I don't want to 

 
just to be externaliz
ing responsibility, really it's 
our fault for picking the wrong supplier and then not realizing it until way 
late in the game. We will be able to claw back some amounts, but it certainly 
will not make up for lost revenue, lost free cash flow. So 

 
some amo
unt, 
yeah, but it's not going to matter that much.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The goal is right now to fix the problem.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Okay. Fair enough. I guess, one other 
issue you referenced a gross margin 
headwind on the S and X due to trim and mix. Was wondering, if you could 
talk maybe a little bit more explicitly about what that was. And then what 
the corrective measures you taking to address that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Te
sla, Inc.
 
Yes. Jon can answer that.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, this is Jon, I can address a piece of this. So a large chunk of it was 
discontinued trims. We've introduced the 100
-
kilowatt battery pack, which 
has a 335
-
mile range in Model S. And as
 
a result of that, we discontinued 
the 90
-
kilowatt pack. And as those cars were in inventory, we reduced price 
to move them out. And so that was a piece of the gross margin headwind 
that won't repeat as we go forward. And in addition to that, the mix did 
s
hift. We sold more 100
-
kilowatt cars, actually, than we predicted we would, 
but order rate went up for the 75's even faster. And so we sold more 75
-
kilowatt cars in the mix than we predicted, and that had a gross margin 
impact as well.
 
Given demand is 

 
it
 
continues to increase for the 100
-
kilowatt pack and the 
mix shift is occurring more towards that product. We'll see as we indicated in 
the letter, increasing margins as we roll into Q4 and then into Q1. So this is 

 
the heart of the discontinuation really
 
was the success of us 
debottlenecking the 100
-
kilowatt production we talked about in Q2 and 
really rolling that into strong demand in Q3.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. We also just increased the amount of value that's in a Model S and...
 
Jonathan Mc
Neill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And with X.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, and X, but particularly Model S, because we're hoping there to be 
greater differentiation between the S and Model 3. So the base 

 
the 
fundamental cost of a Model S increased 
because of more included content. 
So the full Model S have air suspension, for example, yes, much of the 
premium elements were included by default, just because there needs to be 
a clearer the reason for people to buy a Model S or a Model 3.
 
Jonathan McNei
ll 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And the market responded really strongly to that in terms of demand. So in 
Q3, the Model S in the U.S. outsold the Mercedes S Class by two times 

 
over two times actually. And if you added up the sales of Audi A7 and A8, 
the BMW 7 series a
nd Porsche Panamera, we outsold all those, combined.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So the market really did respond to the increased value.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. And all
 
of our deliveries came down, so our market share in the U.S., 
it went up in Q3 for S and X.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
S & X both?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
That's right.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla,
 
Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Compared to Q2.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And I saw some of the articles from our quarterly earnings letter about sort 
of question kind of S and X, why we reduced production on S and X. We 
didn't reduce it ver
y much. It's just sort of from about 2,000 units a week to 
1,800, and we did that in order to breakdown (40:39) inventory. So just 
because inventory was too high. We also just needed much people on Model 
3 line. So we thought we will take the third shift f
rom Model S and the X, 
and apply it to Model 3. Because really, running out of the labor pool, 
honestly. It's like we're a second labor pool dry both in Gigafactory and in 
Fremont. And so it's like 

 
yes. It's just so many people that can make it to 
the Gi
gafactory. And then we're all finding that we're able to improve the 
efficiency of production of the S and X.
 
Previously it required three shifts to do 2,000 units a week. And so 

 
I just 
want to appreciate like the whole supply chain, and everything 
--
 
it
's all 
sized to 2,000 units a week. So likes they're walking spontaneously make 
2,500 units a week because the entire supply chain all the parts, 
everything's going to go to 2,500 and that requires a bunch of CapEx, then 
you got to match, can imagine sort 
of increased stores everything is going to 
increase. So sort of like decide on what seems like the right number, sort of 
the right numbers about 100,000 units a year combined S and X, and resize 
the supply chain accordingly.
 
But we expect to continue makin
g production efficiency improvements on 
the S and X line and be able to take that from 1,800 units a week to 2,000 
units a week in probably over the next year. And still be on two shifts, which 
is labor hours are reducing per vehicle and that gets us to ou
r sort of 
roughly 100,000 units a year week cadence and we can work on supply 
chain efficiencies and the like. But we do expect to 

 
and one point, we 
expect to sell more cars in Q4 than we did in Q3. So we expect sales and 
deliveries to be higher in Q4 th
an Q3. But to reduce Model S and X 
inventory, to achieve that.

Next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
 
Rod Lache

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, 
everybody. Just had a question about how we should be thinking about 
capital spending maybe at a high level next year. It sounds like you're going 
to be deploying some capital to increase to 10,000 units per week. And 
obviously there've also been some repo
rts about you investing in another 
assembly facility in China. So is your CapEx still expected to be lower in 
2018 versus 2017?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, Rod, in terms of the China factory, I'll leave for Elon to make comments 
on that. But I think it 
may be better if we hold on, broadly speaking, to that 
question to the next quarter when we provide full 2018 guidance and give 
you better clarity on our capital spend for the different elements in our plan.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I suspect it's com
parable and similar, honestly, to 2017. We have some 

 
obviously some 

 
it's somewhat of a strategic choice. Do we have higher 
CapEx and higher growth or lower CapEx and lower growth? Yeah, so it's 

 
but we can 

 
we can move that lever wherever it makes se
nse, where it 
makes sense to do so. As I mentioned earlier though we want to make sure 
we know what to scale before we spend money on it. So for the Model 3, 
figuring out which production lines can be simply accelerated and which 
production lines need to b
e duplicated, we'd far rather accelerate a 
production line than duplicate it. If we were to make those CapEx decisions 
right now, we'd be making them 

 
we're kind of shooting in the dark.

Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja

Tesla, Inc.
 
Y
eah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

But in respect to China, I wouldn't expect any significant CapEx on China 
until 2019. It won't be material in 2018.
 
Rod Lache

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The China plant is sort of
 
something like 

 
this is just a like don't say 
(45:59), but it's sort of a rough target of start of production in about three 
years and it would be serving the China market and perhaps some other 
countries in the region and that's really the intent, is to
 
be able to provide 
Model 3 and Model 

 
won't be making Model S and Model X, but we'll be 
making probably Model 3, probably Model Y primarily for the local Chinese 
market and it's really the only way to make the cars affordable in China, but 
it's three yea
rs out, so.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
And just to clarify two points. Is your objective to have something that's 
kind of three
-
month sized in China? And I wanted to also clarify your earlier 
comment about when exactly the production of Mod
el 3 goes exponential. 
Were you suggesting that that...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exponential, right now.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Is that why 

 
I guess, yeah off of a low number but are you getting to a few 
thousand per week already 
by the end of this year or did you mean to say 
that you'll have a few thousand produced in total by the year
-
end?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Oh, no, no. Again, it's really tricky because of that being exponential. If you 
were to move the calendar date b
y plus or minus a few weeks, you'd see 
gigantic differences in weekly output. But what I meant is something like a 
few thousand units per week at the end of Q4.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
But 
there's (47:56), if you said okay, what about a few weeks after Q4? I'd 
say, yeah, definitely. So, it's just going to be very, very 

 
rising very, very 
sharply at that time.

s just giving

I mean, it's something in the hundreds of thousands of vehicl
es per year.

it's at least a couple of hundred 
thousand vehicles a year, maybe more.

Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Your line is 
open.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. I have a question and a follow
-
up, please. Elo
n, you just 
talked about sort of this trade
-
off between growth and capital spending. And 
quite frankly, I think it's really the first time that I've heard you talk about 
that potential trade
-
off. Usually, Tesla's been all about doing as much as 
quickly as 
possible to lead the move to electrification, to establish a first
-
mover advantage, et cetera. So is the hesitancy in going all
-
out growth, is 
that a concern that you might run out of cash and have to raise more cash? 
Is that a bandwidth concern for the or
ganization in terms of trying to do too 
much, too quickly? Is that a concern about using capital effectively? What's 
at the root of that decision? And why is there even a decision, I guess, is the 
question.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I would say tha
t it's probably a bit of both. I mean it's prudent for us to 
think through all of that as we are continuing to grow. Certainly, we want to 
be in a certain sense of fiduciary responsibility that we have in addition to 
just growing like crazy. So...
 
Elon Ree
ve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean these are mad substantial (50:56) growth rates for the auto 
industry. I think we made some comparison of Tesla growth rate relative to 
Ford in the Model T era, and we're talking about a rate of growth faster than 
the Model T, w
hich is the fastest in history. So these are nutty growth rates.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's really not the first time we've thought about this.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. We have talked about that. And our growth rate, I don't recall the e
xact 
numbers, but I think it's been in the 70%, 80% every year. And next year 
even at 5,000, it will be like crazy compared to this year. So growth rate 
continues to be extraordinary.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Yes. Our growth rate continues that a
nything like that in the coming 
years I mean, if it continues to be something like that, Tesla will be the 
largest car company in the world by volume as well.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean, Toni, it may be helpful, it accelerates with new produc
t introductions 
too. Model X reached Model S demand rates in half the time, so twice the 
rate of demand build, so not only are we growing but we're accelerating as 
we grow.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly, Model 3 will be I'd call it five times
 

 
it will be five times 
Model S...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And if you look at the timing and it's order of magnitude shifts a bit 
downward. Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
I guess,
 
the question is...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(52:32).
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
But really perhaps to punctuate a little bit more, you've talked about pretty 
soon you're going to be close to cash flow generative once 
you get the 
volume on the Model 3. And so I'm just surprised why you're actually not 
trying to step on that as quickly as possible because ostensibly once you get 
to that level, then cash flow really doesn't become a problem. And so, is 
there any differenc
e in that view? Otherwise I'm just struggling to sort of 
reconcile why you don't want to get to scale, get to volume, get to positive 
operating cash flow, as quickly as possible?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Just to be clear, we are trying to get as fast as 
we can to 5,000, and then 
we will work as fast as we can to get to 10,000.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I don't think we were saying we wouldn't do it. We were just saying 
we would thin
k through it and make the strategic trade
-
offs, in terms of 
timing. But we'd think through it.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(53:40)
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean sort of like (53:42) interpretations of time scales. For us, it's like, 
well, should we h
ave the growth to 10,000, be 

 
take 9 months, 12 months 
or 15 months?
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Fair enough.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So these are like flash
-
in
-
the
-
pan timescales for other manufacturers.
 
Antonio
 
M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Right. Okay. If I could just follow up on a separate topic, on the Model S and 
Model X gross margins, they look like they must have fallen materially, 
unless Model 3 gross margins were worse than minus 1000%,
 
so maybe you 
can help us understand what Model S and Model X gross margins were this 
quarter and, given most of the one
-
time stuff has gone and the mix shift is 
favorable, why wouldn't they snap back to be similar or better next quarter? 
And do you think 
that the promotional activity helped drive volume for Model 
S and Model X this quarter?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, firstly, your analysis is completely off from what we see 
internally, and the mix shift that we saw, part of that continues in 
Q4.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, largely because we're largely custom orders, so those orders were 
placed in Q3 that we will ship in Q4.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And then as we continue to achieve efficiencies and also work on that mix 
shift, 
which takes time, we will continue to see improvement, and have full 
confidence in Model S and Model X gross margin.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. The (55:25) cars being sold in Q4 are inventory rundown and some, 
you know, particularly in (55:31) old
er models...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Service loaners.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
...the service loaners, and those grow slightly lower, average like less than a 
custom order vehicle, that has a point or two effect on gross margin. But 
yeah, I mean, it should get back to the mid
-
20s, essentially, in Q4.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Our next question comes from Brian Johnson of Barcl
ays. Your line is open.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes. Thank you. Want to just drill down on the service revenue and expenses 
line, not something we often talk about, but a lot of the other questions 
have been asked. Looks like year
-
over
-
ye
ar revenues were up $180 million, 
costs were up $247 million. Could you just talk about the drivers of that 
change, between what's left of the drivetrain outsource business, the CPO 
business, the service loaner actual vehicles expense, and then the cost of
 
the PP&E for the actual people and service infrastructure?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. I think what you see there is, the increase in PP&E for the service 
infrastructure we wanted to get out in front of demand as we're increasing 
both Model S a
nd Model X fleet size, and also Model 3. So we opened a 
location just about every four days in Q3. And to get ahead of that demand, 
you probably saw that we put 180 mobile vehicles on the road. And we plan 
to double that this quarter. And so a lot of that,
 
what you see, is PP&E.
 
In terms of the drivetrain, the drivetrain issue that you mentioned, that's 
mostly behind us; in fact, we see very little of that now. The reliability for 
Model S and Model X continues to improve, and you asked about the CPO 
busines
s. The CPO business, for us, last year 

 
or last quarter was about a 
$238 million revenue business. We expect that to grow to $1 billion run rate 

 
or $1 billion business for all of 2017. And so that business is growing 
rapidly at the same time. And we're 
running those 

 
we do our own CPO 
refurbishment. We do that in the same service infrastructure that we're 
servicing the cars. So you see a little bit of that cost into that line as well.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. And my follow
-
on for 
Deepak, probably, is, can you walk us through 
the depreciation when you produce, for example, in second quarter, those 
100 P100D cars Mr. Musk talked about going into the loaner fleet? How do 
those get depreciated while they are in the loaner fleet? And wh
en they're 
transferred to be sold, what's the accounting on that?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. They are capitalized as inventory, because these cars are salable. And 
when these cars get sold, the depreciation related to those cars gets 
recognized in COG
S.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. So it's not in the cost of the service centers?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No.

The next question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your 
question please.
 
Joseph Spak

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Hi, thank you. You also mentioned some constraints in bodyshop, welding 
and final assembly. And final assembly, 
obviously, makes sense given 
constraints elsewhere. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about 
welding. And then, as you get to your year
-
end run rate, is there still going 
to be a discrepancy between sort of different parts of the entire line? O
r do 
you think everything is going to be roughly at the same level?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Doug, would you like to take that on?
 
Doug Field 
-
 
Tesla Inc.
 
Well with respect to welding, the rate is controlled by 

 
are you specifically 
asking about the vid
eo, or do you have another...
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
I'm sorry. In the letter, it said bodyshop welding, it listed as a constraint.
 
Doug Field 
-
 
Tesla Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(59:56). Yeah.
 
Doug Field 
-
 
Tesla Inc.
 
No, it is not
 
the same constraint. It's not the same level of constraint as the 
Gigafactory, but it is one of the more complex parts of the overall assembly 
line. So to reach our overall production goals, that has to ramp significantly. 
But again, it's not at the same 
level of constraint as modules. And it's really 
driven just by the sheer number of robots in the bodyshop. It's the highest 
concentration of robots anywhere in our overall production line. But it is 
coming up well. The bodies that we're building are of exc
ellent quality. 
We've had fantastic crash results in testing them. And we're building more 
and more every day. We're ahead of the rest of the production curve.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. And then, as a follow
-
up on the capital question. El
on, I think a year 
ago on this call, you said to go from 5 to 10 would require a fair amount of 
capital. But you were confident that it would be less than going from 0 to 5, 
and now that you have some real
-
world experience with the ramp, I'm 
wondering if y
ou have any different views or if you could put a little bit of a 
finer point on that comment?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. I mean, we actually feel even more strongly that our efficiency of 
CapEx on the next phase will be significant compared to the f
irst phase.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, absolutely. Some elements will require almost no CapEx. It really 
comes to realize that the 

 
you really want to make a factory that grows 
incredibly fast. Like really I think speed is the ultimate weapon whe
n it 
comes to innovation or production. And we are pushing robots to the limit in 
terms of the speed that they can operate at, and asking our suppliers to 
make robots go way faster, and they are shocked because nobody has ever 
asked them that question. It'
s like if you can see the robot move, it's too 
slow. We should be caring about air friction like things moving so fast. You 
should need a strobe light to see it. And that's incredibly critical to CapEx 
efficiency. And obviously we're going to be designing 
a lot of the robotic 
elements and what makes the robots internally. So yes, because current 
(1:02:22) suppliers are just too slow to respond in some cases.

Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Thanks so much. Could you talk about the percentage of sales that are 
coming from these loaners of the fleet vehicles? We're trying to reconcile the 
MSRP declines that you implemented an
d what it looks like is a little bit more 
severe ASP decline. And then also, if you could talk a little bit about why you 
felt that it was necessary to add value to the Model S and Model X while 
lowering price? It seems like you should be able to drive vol
umes with one 
or the other.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. I think to the first question I would say it's roughly about 5%.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Very low single
-
digit in terms of the service loaner sales as a 
percentage of total un
its.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel

Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. As far as the prices, Model X was always 

 
it was really the one that 
saw more of a price reduction than other things. And then 100
-
kilowatt h
our 
pack, the 100
-
kilowatt pack cars was artificially priced high because we have 
like really production constraint on that pack. It was never our intention to 
price them quite that high, so we reduced it a little bit. And then added 
some content S to both
.
 
So we sort of split it between some price reductions where we thought 
things were a little overpriced, and then added some content just to have a 
clear differentiation. We weren't quite sure what the response would be to 
the Model 3. So maybe we might ha
ve overcorrected a little bit, but that's 
kind of where it is.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Okay. And then just moving to the China strategy. Obviously, with the 
permanent magnet requirements for the DC motor for the Model 3 and what 
we've seen hi
storically with export restrictions in China and improved 
environmental enforcement in terms of mining practices, how important is 
that to the strategy of moving into China and maintaining your supply lines 
for the growth of the Model 3?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think we think about China more from a demand side than anything. We're 
building complete cars and we're shipping them across the ocean and into 
the largest electric vehicle market in the world. So what really pulls us into 
China primarily i
s to be able to supply that market. And to make the cars 
more affordable, as Elon said, so that we're not forcing consumers to 
experience tariffs if you bring those cars in. That's a much bigger impact 
than I think the supply chain or sourcing materials is
sue.

Robert Cihra

Guggenheim Securities LLC
 
Great. Thank you very much. I recognize it's not the biggest focus right n
ow, 
but just curious on solar declining as you had expected. But just wondering 
when you think that can start growing again. Is that a function of Solar 
Roof? Or is that sort of moving past your sales changes? And then, I guess, 
similarly on energy storage
, the ramp, sort of exiting this year into 2018, is 
that constrained by Model 3? Or is that on its own separate track? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. We do expect the solar demand to rebound as we move solar sales 
into all of our 
stores, which is a much more efficient channel for demand 
generation. And that's just what sort of conventional solar. The Solar Roof 
stuff, we expect is going to be 

 
we're confident it's going to have extremely 
high demand. And we're just going through t
he validation process for the 
solar tiles.
 
And they're working right now, I should point out. So I have the Solar Roof 
tiles on my house. And I didn't even notice that they're there that they blend 
in so well. So look really good but a roof is expected to 
last a long time, at 
least 25, 30 years. And so there's certain rate at which we can do 
accelerated lab testing on (1:07:38) components and maybe try to 
accelerate lab testing on a 30
-
year roof in sort of six months, but it's hard to 
do it less than about 
six months and then we got to pack that into the 
production process.
 
So I have no doubt that this will be a very significant part of the business 
down the road. It just takes a little while to get those behemoth rolling, but 
once it gets rolling, it's goin
g to be a behemoth.

this in the final factory.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

And down the road, there will be some cell conflict. I think if you sort of fast 
forward a year or two, we really need to think about cell production as being 
a constraint and (1:09:17) going into cel
l production (1:09:20) couple of 
years out, making sure that we have (1:09:24) cobalt

8/4/16,Tesla,"Thanks, Martin. So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. 
Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. It's hard to 
think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate 
more than $20 billion in revenue with 
zero advertising spend. I think that's 
like where we do say that from time
-
time and I think it's often overlooked, 
but to have the highest demand electric vehicle in the world with no 
advertising spend is I think quite remarkable and speaks to the nature o
f the 
product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate 
that demand without much of advertising.
 
At our Fremont factory we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the 
NUMMI factory did in its record year of 2006 and obviously
 
we expect to 
exceed that significantly this year. This rate of production was cheap before 
we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont, so there's lot of 
potential to go beyond that number. For the Shanghai factory I'd like to say 
congratulation
s again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model 3 last 
quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year. I'm really excited 
and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory. I think it's going 
to be incredible asset to the company
 
and we also broke ground on the 
Model Y factory in Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
 
Regarding Model Y, it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y 
prototype. And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in 
limited volumes al
ready. Now this is thanks to a great effort of our 
engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy 
efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, 
which means Model Y four wheeler drive got EPA rating of 31
5 miles and this 
improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today. This is above what 
we previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And then just with great 
acceleration, top speed, it's really just an incredible specs all around.
 
For the Cy
bertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed 
the Cybertruck, and that was 
--
 
that went viral and we tried to build a 
product that 
-
a product that is superior in every way without any 
preconceptions of how such product should look. So it rea
lly just from the 
standpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier 
that kicks the ass of any pickup truck, basically that's the goal. And we 
wanted it to look like something that just came out of the sci
-
fi movie set 
from the fut
ure and the demand has been incredible. I have never seen 
actually such a level of demand at this this 
--
 
we've never seen anything like 
it basically. I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many 
years. So 
--
 
as many 
--
 
we'll sell as many 
as we can make, it's going to be 
pretty nuts. So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize 
even, they don't even have enough information to realize just the 
awesomeness of it, it's just great.
 
So and then stepping back in 2018 from a 
financial standpoint, we were free 
cash flow was breakeven, but in 2019 we managed to generate more than 
$1 billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time 
and while building parts of Model Y in production. So, I think to 
--
 
for
 
us to 
have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in 
capacity, while developing new products, while improving the core 
engineering is a testament to the 
--
 
I think incredible performance of the 
Tesla team and I'm just so proud to wo
rk with such a great team.
 
I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control 
and is what has allowed us to get to this compelling financial numbers, while 
at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace. And in 
conclu
sion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of 
years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass 
Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for 
the full self
-
driving, we got the next
-
g
en Roadster and probably in a bunch 
of other products we'll [indiscernible] too.
 
It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and 
technology roadmap. So super
-
fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 
10 years. If you look back
 
10 years from today to 2010, we will produce 
approximately a 1,000 times more cars in 2020 then we produced in 2010, 
8,000 and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and 
Powerpack other things too.
 
So where we will be in 10 years, very exci
ted to consider the prospect.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much Elon and Zachary some opening remarks as well.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. Thanks, Martin. This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and 
I want to thank everyone who has been a part of 
making this happen. On 
2019 a few key points I'd like to highlight. On demand, while we've 
mentioned a few times, it's worth highlighting once again, over the course of 
the year we've transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a 
reservation 
backlog to generating new and organic demand.
 
We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs even increasing slightly in 
Q4 and we've seen an increase in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the 
longer
-
range versions in Q2. With respect to capacity expansi
on, we've 
greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and 
Reno. As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on 
board faster and with less cost. This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in 
Shanghai, as well as M
odel Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched 
in under one year. Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of 
strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, improvements to capital 
efficiency, progress on working capital management and 
continued 
improvement in our product and operational costs. And we were able to 
achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same 
reasons that enabled strong cash generation.
 
We've also made progress on recurring and software
-
based re
venue with the 
implementation of premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades 
available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app. Finally on stock
-
based 
compensation, it increased sequentially by $82 million driven almost entirely 
by an expense related 
to the next tranche of the CEO grant. This is a result 
of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the 
CEO stock grant is tied to. As we look ahead to 2020, this again will be an 
important year for the company. Our task ahead is t
o execute on the next 
phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
 
On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter 
and will ramp over subsequent quarters. As mentioned previously, we are 
forecasting hig
her gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.
 
This year for the Shanghai built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate 
production and delivery rates. In addition, we expect to have completed the 
majority of plant supply chain localization at the fac
tory or in the region. 
This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production 
costs for the site. We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally
-
built 
Model 3 and remain focused on continuing the production ramp and 
managing costs.
 
We also anticipate significant progress on factory 
construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will result in 
continued increases in capital spending. On operating expenses I expect an 
increase over the course of the year to support our g
rowing product pipeline 
and international footprint. However, OpEx growth should increase at a 
lower rate than top line revenue. Overall, we believe this will set us up for a 
strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted cash 
flows
 
to support investments related to our growth and further 
strengthening of our balance sheet.
 
For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by 
seasonality. Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major 
products Model 3 in Shan
ghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will 
temporarily weigh on our margins. We are also in the early stages of 
understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the 
Coronavirus.
 
At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week dela
y in the ramp of Shanghai 
built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown. This may 
slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit 
contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages. We are also 
closely 
monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for 
cars built in Fremont. So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's 
important to caveat that this is an evolving story. However, we have more 
than sufficient cash to continue o
ur expansion plans, while further 
strengthening the balance sheet.
 
Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
A 
-
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. We are going to take the first question from retail investors 
compil
ed by SAY [ph] Technologies. So the first retail investor question is 
since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you 
have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large 
California homebuilders that you can s
hare. What's the 2020 target for the 
number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I think we do 
--
 
we are seeing, [indiscernible] from a small base, 
exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass Roof. So it's a 
[real 
hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the 
demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla 
[source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the 
roofing industry in general, whether is in North Am
erica on the order of 4 
million new roofs per year.
 
So, we see a lot of interest and so it's just a question of refining the 
installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation. But 
over time I would expect a significant percentage o
f new roofs to be 
something 
-
 
to use solar glass in one form or another. It's really going to be 
your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without. 
And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks 
good and l
asts long time and it's the future we want. So it will be a 
significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product 
and that there is a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome 
and this will be a major product line for T
esla. And the Buffalo factory is 
doing great.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Second question from retail shareholders is, will you release the 
Tesla [indiscernible] network app before full autonomy and change the terms 
of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be dr
ivers on the network. If so when 
will this happen? Might want to target California airport first, also good place 
to add Superchargers.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sorry, it sounds like more question then one?
 
Martin Viecha
 
Yes, it's a bit of a bundle, yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I think it's 

 
it probably will make sense to have like to enable car 
sharing in advance of the kind of sort of drive robo
-
taxi fleet because the car 
sharing can be done before full self
-
driving is approved by regulators. So, 
it's probably something 
that we would enable before sort of robo
-
taxi fleet is 
enabled. And, it sounded like there were some other questions bundled in 
there?
 
Martin Viecha
 
Superchargers at airports.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. Yes, probably we'll have superchargers in the airports. We have 
supercharges wherever we see that there is a need for supercharges.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And then on the insurance part of the question, it is our intent to allow 
people to put their cars into ride sharing or the FSD network using Tesla 
Insurance. It's not cur
rently the case, but by the time that this is available, 
it's our intent to get that ready.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Yes, thank you. The next question from retail investors is how many 
California owners are currently insured with Tesla Insurance? What's the 
target fo
r Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start significant 
--
 
to 
significantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of 
your coverage? Will we get premium discount of certain percent?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I mean go ahead Zach.
 
Zachary Kirkh
orn
 
Yes, so Tesla Insurance is currently available in California. A couple of things 
that we're working on this front, the first is to expand it to other locations 
and we are preparing the regulatory processes, preparing our processes to 
go through the reg
ulatory processes in those locations. We're also working 
on the processes to continue to adjust our rates in California, which also 
have to go through regulatory processes as insurance is quite heavily 
regulated. And that's where we're spending our time fo
cusing on Tesla 
Insurance right now. There is a significant amount of innovation as we've 
discussed before in this space, exactly getting to the intent of what the 
question here is using our technology to reduce rates. And this will be rolled 
in over time.
 
Martin Viecha
 
The last part of the question was, will there be a discount for using Autopilot 
with our cars?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, there will be.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
The rate card for California Tesla Insurance already considers the safety 
features associated with 
Autopilot.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right, but I think 
--
 
I think it would make sense for us to close the loop on 
higher use of Autopilot, reduces the insurance costs as well as the 
probability of injury. So I think insurance is going to be I think quite a major 
product 
of Tesla over time. The amount of money that people spend on car 
insurance is like a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car, like you 
can lease a Model 3 right now for $400 a month, but a typical owner in 
California will be paying somewhere between
 
a $100 and $200 a month in 
insurance. So we're talking about something which is maybe a quarter or 
two half of the cost of the lease of the car is insurance. And a lot of that 
insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don't have good 
informat
ion about the drivers and that there is no good way to provide 
feedback where it's a very poor feedback mechanism in terms of the 
insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is being driven, whereas 
we can do that in real time. It's a fundamental in
formation advantage that 
insurance companies don't have.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. The next question is, you set expectations that you would be 
feature complete on FSD by the end of 2019. Can you please provide an 
update on when will we see this with end us
ers, where are you in retrofitting 
the FSD computer to older models?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I mean, to be precise, I said I was hoping would be feature complete 
with both FSD by the end of last year. We got pretty close, it's looking like 
we might be 
feature complete in a few months. The feature complete just 
means like it has some chance of going from your home to work let's say 
with no debentures. So, that's 
--
 
it does mean the features are working well, 
but it means it has above zero chance. So I th
ink that's looking like maybe 
it's going to be couple of months for now. And what isn't obvious regarding 
Autopilot and full self
-
driving is just how much work has been going into 
improving the foundational elements of autonomy. The 
--
 
like the core 
autopi
lots in Tesla or Autopilot software and AI team is just is I think very, 
very strong in making great progress. And we're really only getting to take 
full advantage of the Autopilot hardware and the FSD hardware.
 
So, I think it's 
--
 
the apparent progress as
 
seen by consumer as well seems 
to be extremely rapid, but actually what's really going on my head it seems 
like I said having the foundational software be very strong and with really 
strong foundation. And then really fundamental thing is moving to video 
training. So in terms of labeling, labeling with video in all eight cameras 
simultaneously. This is a really, I mean in terms of labeling efficiency 
arguably like a three order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. 
For those who know about this 
it's extremely fundamental, so that's really 
great progress on that.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall. Since 
most retail investors seem to understand Tesla better than analysts and we 
think a larger part of 
their own personal wealth on Tesla doesn't make sense 
to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us vis SAY. Do you 
even have to take questions 
--
 
answer questions from analysts?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I guess, we don't have to 
--
 
I do think that a lot
 
of retail investors 
actually have deeper and more accurate insights than many of the big 
institutional investors and to me better insight than many of the analysts. It 
seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor 
analysts and wh
at some of the smaller retail investors predicted about the 
future of Tesla, they would 
--
 
you would probably get the highest accuracy 
and remarkable insight from some of those predictions.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. So now let's switch to institutional sharehold
er questions. The number 
one question is, you have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 
65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity. Have you learned to do anything 
better or different from an OpEx perspective? And if yes, what kind of impact 
might we expe
ct on the long
-
term gross margin?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure, go ahead, Zach.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience 
across all line items of COGS for the Model 3 there. We have talked a lot 
about the CapEx being of capa
city being lower, but I mean you can basically 
run down entire list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to 
localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense 
from the states.
 
Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound 
logistics and outbound 
logistics costs as well, so we're not shipping cars from California over to 
China. And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import 
related costs. And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the 
layout comp
arison between our Fremont facility here in California and also 
the Model 3 factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is 
pretty evident from that layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of 
savings for the operations of the facilit
y.
 
And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant 
reduction in the cost of Model 3 in China relative to Fremont, but I think it's 
also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that 
we're selling out 
of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming 
out of Fremont from price perspective. And so and I've said this on previous 
earnings calls, I think it's fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai 
facility to match the same margin for the
 
vehicle in Fremont.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just 
making cars, especially affordable cars 3 and the Y, at least on the continent 
where the customers are. It kind of makes sense it's 
--
 
but what we'
re doing 
will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making cars in 
California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and 
Europe. And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so 
they got lot of finished g
oods, sitting on the order or waiting at the port or 
going through customs, tariffs, transport, it's 
--
 
and then the factory 
complexity in California is very high, because you've got different regulatory 
requirements in China, North America and Europe.
 
So 
we got three different types of cars that are being built, it's very complex 
and just having a factory in China, a factory in California, a factory 
--
 
North 
America factory in Europe. Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in 
our formula operating 
efficiency. Now that I think this may not be fully 
appreciated.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And also on working capital.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, absolutely.
 
Martin Viecha
 
According you see OpEx here to, but it's not 2010. Okay. The next question 
from institutional investors i
s given the recent run in the share price, why 
not raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production 
i.e. fill te Gigafactories, investment in Supercharger and customer service.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we're actually spending money as quickly
 
as we can spend it sensibly. 
So if there's any sensible way to spend money, we're spending it. There is 
no artificial hold back on expenditures anything that I see that is what looks 
like a 
--
 
it's got good value for money. The answer is yes immediately. 
So 
--
 
but we're spending money I think efficiently and we're not artificially limiting 
our progress. And then despite all that we are still generating positive cash. 
So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money because we expect 
to generate ca

 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes, I completely agree with that. I think some of our learnings during the 
Model 3 launch period where we grew too quickly and with too much 
complexity. And it held back our ability to continue
 
to scale and part of the 
journey that we've been on in 2019 is to underline a series of unintentional 
that process is that kind of accumulated in the company over time.
 
And so that's kind of what contributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year 
as we ge
t smarter about that. And now we've laid a good foundation and I 
think and I agree with you on that we're not holding back on the growth. I 
mean we have two products, two vehicle products launching right now and 
that will consume much of the bandwidth of t
he company to stabilize those 
over the course of the year. And then looking into next year, we have even 
more products launching, more factors. So we want to be smart about how 
we spend money and grow in a way that's sustainable. So we don't positive 
term 
to the mistakes I think we made a year and a half or so.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, absolutely.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. The next question we've already answered regarding Autopilot 
timelines. So, the following question would be, can we please talk about cost 
control and OpEx sustainability in terms of growth versus gross profit 
growth. How did we achieve the recent OpEx trends and how should we 
think about OpEx needs as we grow both vehicles and geographic 
workloads?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
I commented briefly on thi
s in my opening remarks. We did see an increase 
in operating expenses from Q3 to Q4, even excluding the portion of that 
attributed to stock
-
based compensation. And when you double click into that 
growth, it's supporting the Model Y program and also Shangha
i program as 
well. And so I think we as a company are now at the point where we've 
learned a lot on cost efficiency as I've just mentioned and we've unwound a 
number of the processes that were not in the right place including 
automating the things that nee
d to be automated. And we'll continue on that 
journey. But I think we're at a point now where OpEx will start to tick up at 
least if you look annually from 2019 to 2020 to support our international 
footprint and then the growth of the company. It 
--
 
our jo
b is to grow that 
significantly slower than the pace of growth of revenue to improve the 
operating leverage, which we're very, very focused on.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. And the last question from investors is the sales of Model S and X 
have stayed flat for seve
ral quarters, the main reason is that they still use 
18650 batteries. When we will S & X use 2170 batteries manufacturing 
capacity of 18650 may be used for battery storage systems since that.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. Well, actually the core chemistry inside the 186
50 cell has improved 
many times over the years. So, it's really the form factor as opposed to a 
core technology. So it's, yes, I think we're pretty happy with where the 
--
 
the energy content, the sell
-
in, the improvements in efficiency of both 
vehicle. We'
re rapidly approaching a 400 mile range for the Model S, for 
example. So this is 
--
 
it won't be long before Model S is 400 mile range. 
Anything you want to add to that?
 
Unidentified Company Representative
 
No other than to say that the 18650 line is running
 
smoothly for really long 
time and in a world where self
-
supply is fueling growth like or part of the 
fuel growth, I don't see a reason to turn that self
-

 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, and actually the Model S and X actually have more range than we are 
cur
rently stating on the website. We just haven't gotten around to updating 
the I guess the EPA sort of right number, but the actual range of the Model S 
and X are above what the websites as there are, yes the existing cars are 
better, so that being made.
 
Zac
hary Kirkhorn
 
Actually been that way for...
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, it must be somewhere in the 380s of what like that.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much and Sherry let's go to the Q&A on the phone.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, again. [Operator Instructions] Our first 
question comes from 
Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Hi, everybody and actually agree the retail questions were excellent actually. 
So Elon, do you see potential for Tesla vehicles to be fitted with user 
terminals that are compatible with the Sta
rLink constellation in the near or 
medium
-
term future?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, it's certainly something that could happen in coming years. If there's 
no plans throughout this year, the folks at StarLink is ready for high 
bandwidth, low latency connectivity for hom
es and businesses and I guess 
aircraft and boats and that kind of thing, but the antenna for that high 
bandwidth, low latency thing is sort of about the size of medium Pizza which 
you could put on a car, but I think is more bandwidth than you would really 
need or you tend 
--
 
being buy just take it on the car. Yes, it will workplace 
for antenna.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Well, maybe just a follow
-
up 
--
 
from follow
-
up, how we're assuming that we 
get the antenna form factor and cost down to a point where that could be 
integr
ated into the roof of a car for example, cost effectively and 
aerodynamically, et cetera? How would compatibility with the StarLink 
architecture theoretically improve the Tesla customer experience or the 
capability of the network?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I 
think actually in most parts of the world we just use the cellular 
connectivity, just use 5G would be a recommendation to like in any cities or 
something like that. But if you're out in the countryside and there's is not 
good cell connectivity, then you co
uld connect with StarLink antenna. And 
you wouldn't need 
--
 
you don't need to like have like gigabit level or level 
connectivity probably like 20, 30 megabits supply fine and then you have 
much more antenna. So yes, I guess it could be good for yes making 
sure 
there is connectivity in outside of major cities and that kind of thing. But I 
mean that's a 
--
 
sort of I'd say relatively obtuse, so I'm not thinking about it 
very much to be honest.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
Th
ank you. Our next question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.
 
Dan Galves
 
Good afternoon, thanks. So hoping you could give us some guidance on 
what CapEx is going to be this year and kind of as I look to model out the 
business long
-
term, is there a 
rule of thumb that we can use for capital 
expenditures per unit of production capacity or some sort of rule of thumb 
like that?
 
Elon Musk
 
I don't know if we wanted to tell you, I don't think we want to say what our 
CapEx is going to be this year and certai
nly 
--
 
except to say that like 
--
 
as I 
said earlier, we're spending money as fast as we can spend money in 
sensible ways. So it's definitely not artificially limited. We will spend like a lot 
of money this year for sure. It's 
--
 
the challenge comes in like
 
finding 
efficient ways to actually deploy the capital, that's the harder part then and 
sort of deciding on a CapEx number really.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. And I think we'll always find ways to become more CapEx efficient 
[indiscernible] capacity. We challeng
e the teams to always become more 
efficient and so we see reduction per 
--
 
in terms of CapEx.
 
Elon Musk
 
Absolutely.
 
Dan Galves
 
[Indiscernible].
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, it's good. Yes, I think there's so much 
--
 
it has a way that the core 
technology is improving rad
ically that maybe you wouldn't necessarily notice 
as an end customer or some of them where you would notice, some that you 
wouldn't, but it's just there are these things that we have a big effect on the 
efficiency of the company like our internal applicati
ons team that kind of 
builds the Tesla internal operating system and if we just 
--
 
sort of core 
automation of the company, that makes a big difference to our productivity, 
but you wouldn't necessarily 
--
 
you would see it effectively in healthy 
financials, 
but you wouldn't necessarily notice that as an end customer.
 
Dan Galves
 
Okay, got it. Maybe I could follow
-
up, I mean your kind of operating cash 
flow, EBITDA is annualizing at $4.5 billion right now. As I look out to the 
future, I'm kind of guessing that 
that could fund somewhere around 200,000 
to 250,000 units of capacity a year which would be maybe a 30% CAGR over 
five years. I mean is that something that's feasible for you guys to execute 
on a consistent basis a level of capacity building that large?
 
Za
chary Kirkhorn
 

 
Elon Musk
 
We're having for more than 30%, yes.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes, I think they're not 
--
 
I'm not sure the math that you've done, but I 
think our internal plans are faster. And just back on your first question, we 
will hav
e additional detail on CapEx in the 10
-
K, but back to the growth rate, 
I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a 
loan facility in place to support that growth. So that helps. And then as our 
production volumes increase t
hat generates more cash on the business as 
well, that allows us to continue to fund additional factory. So I wouldn't 
necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I 
--
 
yes, I think on our [indiscernible
] a 
few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that Tesla would grow at an 
average compound average rate of in excess of 50%, I 
--
 
by saw hold to 
that belief.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes 
from [indiscernible].
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress. First question related 
to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make. Can 
you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on 
the 
cost of production for making those Cybertrucks?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I think we don't comment on those detailed numbers except the 
demand is just far more than we could reasonably make in the space of, I 
don't know, three or four years, something like that.
 
So the thing we're 
going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity 
because that's very fundamental because if you don't improve battery 
production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one 
product to another and 
you haven't actually produced more electric vehicles. 
So that's part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated 
production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless 
we've got a lot of battery cells available then 
--
 
and say like accelerating 
production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure 
Model 3 or Model Y cars. So we've got a really 
--
 
make sure we get a very 
steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost per 
kilowatt of the b
atteries. This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
 
So that we said we're going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of 
explain more about this what our plans are. I think probably it's going to 
make sense to do that after the end of this 
quarter, because I think it's 
going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter. So 
tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind 
of go through what the challenges are, how do you get from here to, I don't
 
know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Great. I'll look forward to that Battery Day. Elon, you also mentioned in your 
prepared comments about other products that may come up and the only 
vehicle not announced fo
r Master Plan Part II is a high passenger density 
vehicle, any light that you can give us regarding that project?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, going back to what I just said that we got to improve the total battery 
capacity otherwise we add complexity, but we do not imp
rove the number of 
vehicles on the road. So what we do some sort of high
-
capacity vehicle at 
some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to 
make cars that we already that are riding on our fleet. And it's just generally 
true when I s
ee some I think sort of sensible comments by our arc invest, 
whether pointing out that really people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly 
by themselves and like the average, yes I mean the average number of 
occupants in a car, I think is like 1.2 and ma
ybe with autonomy maybe it will 
go to 1.4 maybe, but I'm not sure if that 
--
 
it even goes there. So, well, it 
makes sense just for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of truck like that or 
something like probably, but like I said we're going to solve those 
battery 
--
 
we got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even 
balance today, that's the real problem.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question please.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from John Sagar [ph] with Evercore
 
ISI.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Thanks for taking my call. I want to talk about the differences between the 
Model 3 and the Model Y beyond the sort of 10% rule of thumb, just around 
cargo and size. Are there other features that are going to differentiate the 
tw
o models. And then as a follow on to that, you've talked in the past about 
how Model S sales grew with the introduction of Model X. So are you 
planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis that 
essentially Model 3 sales will e
xpand alongside the introduction of Model Y?
 
Elon Musk
 
You know, we're not quite sure what's going to happen with, but it is true 
that Model X, the introduction of Model X actually increased Model S sales 
because you would come in, look at the Model X and 
they like said okay, I'd 
prefer the Sedan and we're worried that X sales would of course S sales drop 
there 
--
 
actually could increase. So from us 
--
 
we're not too worried about 
demand, we are worried about production, make sure we get that production 
ramp
 
going and reach volume production as soon as possible with the Model 
Y. And it's hard for 
--
 
it's always to hard predict what 
--
 
the exponential part 
of the S curve of production. Production pretty much always follows those S
-
curve or it's kind of like a 
herky
-
jerky S
-
curve. And you can use to predict 
what it's going to be like in the beginning because it's flow and it is pretty 
question like at the end, but that intermediate portion of the S curve is very 
difficult to predict.
 
So that's and it involves a 
massive amount of hard work and just reacting 
fast to issues that arise. So, I think we're just going to have go as best we 
can with Model Y and make sure it's a great product. I think there are some 
things that will differentiate it, but not 
--
 
does on ou
r October analyst call. 
And I think, so when they do, when people do a teardown of the Model Y, I 
think they will be impressed about some of the things they see.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And just to add to that, I think it's important to keep the Model Y launch in
 
context over the next 18 to 24 months. But what we're working on here 
between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have 3 and Y locally 
produced in all location.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And so, Model 3 is expanding as Model Y is expanding, may be
 
ups and 
downs various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on 
the major continents.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Also the rule of thumb of 10%, I think you need to see it when you see the 
car, you realize that it's not just a 10% 
different car. It's not just that 
--
 
there is more change happening like to the customers' perspective as well.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
All right, thank guys.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question
 
comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
 
Colin Rusch
 
Thanks so much guys. Can you speak to the pricing strategy in light of the 
China price reduction, as well as the mission to increase EV adoption. Is 
there a target for gross profit or operating profit o
n a per
-
vehicle basis that 
we should be thinking about or how should we really frame that for 
ourselves?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I mean we're trying to make the cars as affordable as possible, as fast 
as possible, while maintaining reasonable 
--
 
while still being a
t least a little 
bit profitable and growing the company like crazy and having good free cash 
flow and accumulating our cash balance. Zach, anything you want to add?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
No, I think that's fair say. I mean our order rate supports the 
pricing that we 
have right now. We're working very hard to reduce cost and expand 
production because I mean we feel from the data it's pretty clear that 
there's a lot of interest in our products. And so 
--
 
we're working on is to 
increase production, increa
se availability of the products with time. And the 
price reduction in China, kind of, the first step towards this global 
localization, more accessible price and we'll continue to work on cost 
reductions in China as we do in Fremont and grow production.
 
Elo
n Musk
 
Yes, I mean the thing that's really going to I think probably just have a 
profound effect on our financials is like is high volume and high margin 
obviously and that high
-
margin part comes from autonomy. So, do people 
buy the full self
-
driving packa
ge or not and do that buy it worldwide or only 
in certain places. For example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is 
in the US, so fewer people 
--
 
a very small percentage people by the FSD 
package in China. But as we 
--
 
as we fix that then we will 
see a much higher 
people, percentage of people buying. And as we're close to full self
-
driving 
that is just going to become more and more compelling. So that's for our 
financial standpoint, that's the real mind
-
blowing situation is high volume, 
high
-
margin
 
because of autonomy.
 
Colin Rusch
 
Okay. And then just shorter
-
term, there's significant discussion in industry 
around moving to higher voltage on the Powertrain. And then some 
challenges around the supply chain preparedness to support that, separate 
from t
he battery packs since we'll talk about that in a couple of months. Can 
you speak to the areas of focus on Powertrain technology driven cost 
reduction over the next 12 to 24 months that we should be thinking about?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, Powertrain is pretty damn
 
Good, I mean it's very than anything else 
other by a country mile. It's worth noting for example at the 
--
 
the Model S 
has like 100 kilowatt pack, but Tacon [ph] has 100 kilowatt like 95 kilowatt 
hour pack. The Model S is steadily approaching 400 miles ra
nge, the Tacon 
has 200 miles range. So we must be using that energy pretty efficiently and 
the Powertrain is a big part of that.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
I would just say that focus is on cost on the Powertrain when we're thinking 
about technology innovations, it'
s how do we continue to drive the cost 
down.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And that's through voltages maybe one angle, but there are certainly others 
that just enable more power density and lower cost.
 
Elon Musk
 
Looks like Powertrain is like mind 
blowing I think. Yes. Coming out later this 
year end of the year, probably, that's our goal, get Powertrain up end of the 
year and then it's going to be like 
--
 
this is like alien technology, it's insane. 
I think, I think we could do, yes, I mean I think t
here was no way, this could 
get engineering team, Tesla to a little about hardcore engineering.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Let's go to the next question please.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
 
Emmanuel Rosner
 
Hi, good ev
ening, everybody. So in your slide deck, you had the comments 
around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in 2020. Can you 
maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like 
that metric evolve, obviously you have the Model
 
Y which probably would 
have initial higher pricing and then the China Model through at a lower price. 
So I guess what are the puts and takes for what you see as sort of like 
steadily in 2020?
 
Elon Musk
 
Making the price better and better, so is the value. 
I know we're wondering 
we come out of prices and so I think or adjust according to what the demand 
looks like, I mean like right now it's pretty good, maybe they will change 
who knows, yes.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
But I think the way you described, it is fair. So
 
I mean, relative to the 
current Model 3, China Model 2 pricing is slightly lower. And our Model Y 
pricing is public on the website. So you can see that it's clearly slightly 
higher than what Model 3 is out of Fremont. How the mix of those three 
products a
nd that's out over the course of the year, we'll see. I think it's 
probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those stays fairly stable in 
terms of ASP, when you average them together.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I mean the affordability of our car and trying to 
improve radically 
because for a very 
--
 
to tariffs mostly going to weigh, purchase tax 
exemption, local cost supply, not having to spend a bunch of money to 
transport it over the ocean. So the affordability is nine day for our car intent.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Tha
nk you. Let's go to the next question please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
 
Dan Levy
 
Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking the question. Just want to follow
-
up 
on the question on capital raise. So given the 
cheaper cost of capital and this 
is a real competitive advantage for others, why wouldn't it make sense to 
raise capital to either pay down debt or to pursue acquisitions especially 
bolt
-
ons that could help you accelerate capabilities and all
-
time in this 
battery technology?
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean, if you know of any acquisitions, we'd love to hear about them. Yes, 
sure. Sounds great, whom should we acquire?
 
Dan Levy
 
Well, given the importance of autonomous I imagine that this is an area that 
you would want to ac
celerate, if you view it as a crucial competitive 
advantage?
 
Elon Musk
 
We're not aware of anyone that we'd want to acquire.
 
Dan Levy
 
And debt pay down?
 
Elon Musk
 
Leading the company to pay down debt, doesn't sound like wise.
 
Dan Levy
 
I think the 
broader, there's been a couple of versions in this question over 
the course of the call. I think what we're saying more broadly is that as we 
look forward on the cash generation from the business relative to what our 
plans are, we are not constrained.
 
Elon
 
Musk
 
Yes, we're going to pay down the debt just as time goes by and we paid 
down $0.5 billion worth the debt last quarter. So we'll just keep steadily 
paying it down and yes, so, yes. But, yes, I don't think we have any more 
say on that part, all right?
 
M
artin Viecha
 
Okay, thank you. Let's go to the next question please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street 
Research.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Thank you for taking my question. Elon, I wanted to come back on batteries. 
If I lo
ok at the end of this year, you should have 
--
 
units in position capacity 
soft cars, so that if you add 
--
 
the energy storage means mid probably north 
of 60 gigawatt of battery production capacity. So where do you stand now, 
and how do you get there? And t
hen it looks like your competitors are those 
who would like to compete with you, seem to be struggling to grow battery 
capacity. So if you can just take us through what you're doing differently, 
why you're confident you can do that, I mean it seems like no
body else can.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I guess a lot of people sort of wait front of us for not like grow bulk 
cars and bulk capacity and it's like now to turn that actually even the pros 
have trouble with it, it's pretty hard. So, but the fact is, we've already 
d
emonstrated massive growth and so production capacity at our Gigafactory, 
Nevada. And they have to go from the sales to the modules to the pack, so 
to sell capacity but also module and impact capacity. So we've just gotten 
pretty good at that and we've wor
ked well with key partners like Panasonic, 
our relationship has been excellent. They've been a great partner with us for 
many years. We've added some additional partners that are small at scale 
with LG and CAGL. And I will have more to talk about this in d
etail in Battery 
Day, like I said probably April, we've got a very compelling strategy. I mean 
we are super deep on cell 
--
 
super deep cell
-
through battery, cell module 
battery.
 
Drews, anything you want to add to that?
 
Unidentified Company Representative
 
T
hanks, I think you said it all.
 
Elon Musk
 
We are super deep.

Elon Musk
 
Rabbit [ph] all goes down pretty far.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Seven days only.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, we did seven days a week now battery produ
ction. Man, we know a lot 
of factories.
 
Unidentified Company Representative
 
The only thing I would add is we do have a decade plus of experience of not 
just like what a cell should be but how to integrate it into the product and 
that's really helped us.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, absolutely and how to manage the cell and the module, the battery and 
through for weather conditions and different environmental and different 
charge regimes and while we really know about batteries 
--
 
so next level.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Okay, tha
nks. And Zach, maybe a quick mundane follow
-
up for you, that's 
rate. Can you give us a sense of the impact of the ramp of Shanghai on your 
COGS in Q4?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes, we were negative gross margin on the products that we built in Q4, but 
the team in 
China, I think did a great job managing cost during the launch. 
And so there was a slight drag associated with it, but not terribly significant.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. And let's go to the last question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our last question will 
come from Joseph Osha with JMP 
Securities.
 
Joseph Osha
 
Further to the conversation around the cell technology, just wondering if you 
can comment on what the plans are for the Maxwell technology that you 
acquired here as a capacitor or dry cell or what have
 
you? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, like I said, we're going to talk about this in Battery Day, which is 
probably April. And then a lot of these questions will be answered. I think it's 
going to be a very compelling story that we have to present. I think it's 
go
ing to actually block those minds, of course my mind and I know it. So it's 
going to be pretty cool.
 
Joseph Osha
 
Maxwell that ultracap technology is kind of part of 
--
 
part of the plan?
 
Elon Musk
 
It's an important piece of the puzzle, yes. I think like som
e of the sort of 
retail investors have managed to put together several piece of the puzzle 
that it had the most insight.
 
Joseph Osha
 
I shall have to read the blogs more. Thank you.

Hi, thanks. There's been a fair amount of debate recently both amongst 
investors, I think, but also within the supply chain about the segments 
within the transportation ecosystem that will sort of forever
 
be off limits to 
Tesla because of physical limitations of electric drivetrains, specifically as it 
relates to weight and energy density and things of that nature. Presumably 
you disagree, but I'd be interested in hearing maybe why you disagree, why 
you th
ink Tesla can compete in those segments whereas other people think 
diesel or fuel cells or other options would be better.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
You're thinking of things like heavy trucking?
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
For 
instance, yeah, that's 

 
I mean, I guess, different people draw the line in 
different areas, but as an example, yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I'm not sure what you're saying. I'm absolutely confident that electric 
powered trains will 

 
el
ectric vehicles will occupy every segment without 
exception. And I don't want to jump the gun on the Tesla Semi truck 
unveiling later this year, but I think, it's going to be a good (3:54) product, 
and will defy people's expectations on what an electric tr
uck can do. So I 
really do not see any segment of transport that will not be electric, in fact 
I'm highly confident that all transport will go fully electric with the ironic 
exception of rockets. Yeah, just kidding.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter

Piper Jaffray

Yeah, okay. Very good.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
No easy way around Newton's Third Law.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Right. Okay. And then I guess maybe one Model 3 question here. I know, it's 
maybe early days. Is there an
y way to gauge sort of what you think the trim 
and option uptake is going to look like on the Model 3 just to give folks an 
idea of what the pricing and margin profile might look like? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think it's really guessw
ork at this point, but if it were to be comparable to 
what we see with say Model S or with what other vehicles in the market 
(05:03) it's something like a 20% to 30% increment over the finished 
product (5:08) would be the typical average. Jon, do you have 
any...?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I think that's right. And we experienced a little bit higher than that in 
Model S. And Model S in comparison to Model 3 has more range, has more 
power, has more cargo, et cetera. And we'll be introducing 
at the start of 
production. I think, we'll be announcing our vehicle as we get closer to the 
start of production what those vehicle specs will be, but I think 20% is a fair 
number to use.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, actually just to reemphasize that. I might repeat that a few times on 
the call. We want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version 3 of our car. 
Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with 
fewer features. But the 
Model S and the Model 3 will be at the same level of 
technology, and if you were to put a version on, say, what 

 
I would say 
probably on version 4 of Model S, and Model 3 will also be on version 4. If 
you think of like the essentially the first 

 
when Mod
el S first came out, just 
rear
-
wheel drive, and we had dual motor all
-
wheel drive, we had initial 
Hardware 1 Autopilot, and then Hardware 2 Autopilot, and there was a facial 
refresh. There have been roughly four versions of Model S, and we're on the 
fourth
 
version of Model 3, will be also version 4. It's a little confusing, 
because one's a letter and the other's a number. But Model 3 was supposed 
to be called the Model E. But then Ford intended to sue us, and then I 
thought we were being all clever by calli
ng it the Model 3, but actually the 
joke's on me, because it caused confusion in the marketplace, so we're 
doing our best to clear up that confusion so people do not think that Model 3 
is somehow superior to Model S. Actually Model S will be better than Mo
del 
3, as it should be, because it's a more expensive car.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Okay, good. Yes, very clear. Thanks very much.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
We're going to be kind of a broken record on this front. And the me
ssaging 
might get a little annoying, but we really have to be emphatic to clear up an 
error, for which I take full responsibility in naming something that inherently 
would cause confusion in the marketplace.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update 
qualitatively or quantitatively, on
 
how investors should think about battery 
costs. I think your last public statement was that Tesla's battery cost early 
last year was under $190 per kilowatt hour. If we look at Powerwall 2, 
there's been significant improvement in cost per kilowatt and in 
density, but 
I think if we try to do the math on Powerwall 2, we still come up with a 
number that's reasonably high. So maybe you can help us. I think in the 
past, Elon, you've said that you hope to get to $100 per kilowatt hour by 
2020, and I recognize th
at's aspirational, but maybe you can help us a little 
bit frame how we should think about battery cost today. What kind of 
improvement you're seeing from, or expect to see with 2170 batteries in 
vehicles going forward?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, I mean, you got numbers for classical RFC (9:30) closely held 
competitive information. It's just that we do expect to see significant 
improvements year
-
over
-
year as much as improving the core chemistry of 
the cell, reducing essentially the cell mass 
that is inactive, and of course, 
mass economies of scale and vertical integration at the Gigafactory. These 
will all take time and effort, but there will be significant time. Now with the 
Powerwall, there are a bunch of other costs in the Powerwall that ar
e more 
than just the batteries. So, you have the cell cost and then you have to turn 
the cell into a module. You have all the cooling systems, the control 
systems, the safety stuff which prevents cell run away, the enclosure, the 
modem to communicate to da
ta, and then (10:42) maybe power electronics 
to take the power from the cells and convert that to AC or DC power that the 
house can use. JB, something you'd like to add to that?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
No, that's a great description. It's 
a fully integrated product. It's a system, 
not just a bunch of cells. So if you maybe try and calculate dollar per 
kilowatt hour costs to the Powerwall, I think you'd find it's extremely 
competitive against other home energy storage systems, we believe it'
s the 
best. But there is a lot of other hardware in there. It's all included, all 
wrapped together in the Powerwall price, so you don't have to piecemeal a 
system in your house.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Right, but we are confident that the Powe
rwall is the highest quality product 
and actually at the lowest cost of anything on the market. So that is a good 
product, and, I'm feeling pretty happy with it.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
And some of the improvement trajectory that you saw, 
from Powerwall 1 to 
Powerwall 2, part of that is made possible by the migration to 2170 cells 
made at Gigafactory. Not all of it, but a large part of it. So that is something 
we're pleased with and feel is going well.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Ber
nstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Thank you. I was wondering also, your customer deposits, and I 
recognize there's a lot in that, declined for the second straight quarter, and 
at least by my math, it appears as though Tesla's new car inventory has 
increased substanti
ally over the last couple quarters, maybe 3,500 units, or 
about 50%, even though sort of production and deliveries have been 
relatively constant. I'm wondering if you are seeing incremental demand 
pressure on Model X and particularly Model S. Elon, you und
erscored that 
there was confusion in the marketplace. And are these the metrics that are 
suggesting to you that there's some confusion in the marketplace? Are you 
seeing cancellations? Because at least optically, it looks like the book
-
to
-
bill 
is less than
 
1 on Model S and Model X.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, Deepak here. A couple of questions that you had. Firstly just to clarify, 
our finished vehicle inventory only increased very slightly from end of Q4 to 
end of Q1, and we are using some of t
hat in different ways, and Jon can 
explain that further. And also to your other question on customer deposits, 
what I'm seeing is that we had an artificial backlog in our customer deposits 
of Model Xs and as our production of Model Xs has stabilized, and a
s our mix 
of Model X has increased relative to Model S, we have cleared that, so it's 
nothing unusual from what I'm seeing there. And Jon, you want to add on 
the...?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
That's right. The increase in inventory is about spl
it in two. One is we 
increased Model X test drive vehicles by about a thousand over the past 
quarter. We had prioritized deliveries as we've ramped up Model X 
production, and prioritized getting cars to customers first, and to our stores 
second. Our stores
 
have finally gotten their test drive fleets. And that's what 
you see in terms of half of the unit volume increase. The second half is in 
our service loaners. So as our installed fleet has gone up, we wanted to 
make sure that our owners were getting a serv
ice loaner, and so we will 
continually increase that, and you'll see that over time. That's not a one
-
time event, you'll see, as we continue to deliver this level of cars per 
quarter, that we will increase the service loaner fleet proportionately, so that 
we've got the ability to offer a Tesla to our customers.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, in fact this will take us a few months to fully deploy. But our policy for 
service loaners is that the service loaner fleet will be the very best version of
 
a Tesla that is available. So if you have a Model X that comes in for service, 
the service loaner you will get will be the absolute fully loaded state
-
of
-
the
-
art P100D Ludicrous best Model X that we have. The same for the Model S. 
So it'll be the kind of 
thing where you hope that service takes a long time, 
because you have the absolute top of the line Tesla as a service loaner.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
So, Elon, just to clarify that the confusion that you believe exists 
potentially 
between Model 3 and Model S, that's not being inferred from order patterns, 
that's being inferred more qualitatively from what you're learning in 
showrooms, or how do you make that assessment of the problem?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
No, no. We have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people 
being confused that Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S. And we took action 
to correct that about a month ago, but that message has not filtered down 
to all of our customers. So ther
e's still a lot of people who are under the 
impression that Model 3 is the upgrade from Model S but in fact, if they want 
to upgrade, they should just buy the latest Model S. That's the actual 
upgrade path. If you're, like, thinking that the upgrade path f
rom an Audi A6 
isn't Audi A4. It's not. So it's just a question of correcting that 
misconception, which I'm confident we'll be able to do in the next several 
weeks.

Thank you. Our n
ext question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.
 
Colin Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. You've talked about in the past, 
reinventing the machine that makes the machine, and now that we're 
getting a little bit closer to t
he Model 3 launch, any additional color on what 
steps in automation you're doing for the Model 3, and any rough order of 
magnitude of how much more automated the Model 3 would be versus the 
traditional production line?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, so with Model 3, I think we'll be roughly comparable with the best 
high
-
volume vehicle production lines in the world. Better in some respects, a 
little worse in others. But roughly comparable, and then with some further 
iteration, I think it will pro
bably be a little bit better than the next
-
best 
automotive production line. Then where things will really be a step change, I 
think, beyond any other auto manufacturer, will be the Model Y factory. And 
this is all a function of designing the product to be 
easy to manufacture and 
easy to automate, as well as designing the factory itself. So Model
-
wise, I 
think, we're really the common step change, but Model 3 is going to be at or 
probably slightly better than I think the next best automotive production in 
th
e world. I just think that's pretty good outcome. And then Model Y will be 

 
there will be nothing close to it, I think.
 
Colin Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Got it.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Let me just add as a relevant benchmark against the 
Model S and the Model 
X, Model 3 is vastly more automated. And perhaps it's not the best 
benchmark to use looking forward, but it's perhaps three to four times more 
automated than a Model S or a Model X. And much, much simpler to build.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

T
esla Motors, Inc.
 
Is that one
-
fifth of the hours per car?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-

Yep.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
So it's five times the volume, but the same hours per car.
 
Colin Langan

UBS Securities LLC

Elon 
Reeve Musk

Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Compared to S.
 
Colin Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
And, as a follow
-
up, any color on you've announced the doubling of the 
supercharger network, and increasing your dealers. I mean, how should we 
think about that over the next 
few years? Is that doubling going to be 
enough? Or how do you see the network needing to expand going forward?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
We're expanding the (19:48) substantially, made that announcement just 
recently and you can find on our 
website. That's going to continue to 
increase dramatically. Do you want to speak to service, Jon?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, so service, service locations are one that you see increasing in the 
shareholder letter. But you should probably t
hink about service capacity in 
two ways now. One of the things we've discovered as we've deployed more 
advanced service techniques into our centers, is that a supermajority of the 
cars we repair don't require a lift. That frees us from brick and mortar 
ser
vice. And we've added substantially now to our mobile service capability 
starting first experimenting in the variance of our major markets, and we'll 
be rolling that out throughout the year. So we're creating service capacity in 
two ways; mobile service an
d fixed
-
service operations. But the fixed
-
service 
operations are becoming much, much, more efficient.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
With much higher throughput.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Absolutely, much higher throughput through worker per
 
square foot across 
really every metric.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morg
an Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hi, everyone. Elon, the first question is on CFIUS and Tencent. So after 
acquiring a 5% passive stake in the company, I'm thinking given the highly 
sensitive nature of your proprietary tech, and computer vision, A.I., robotics, 
et cete
ra, and all of the related infrastructure, I would imagine that the 
Commission for Foreign Investment in the United States and the Pentagon 
might be concerned of the idea of a Chinese, or potentially a Chinese state 
backed company going any further than a 
small passive stake. Am I 
watching too many cold war movies here, or is there a potential for some 
sensitivity on the grounds of national security?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
But I don't think 

 
5% is not that big of a deal. They're not present a
t board 
meetings. They don't have any insight into Tesla that's not public.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, as Elon said, this is a passive investment, and it doesn't require CFIUS 
clearance from that point of view.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stan
ley & Co. LLC
 
Okay.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
And they don't have any access to confidential information or board 
materials, so it's just a belief and a support of what they think Tesla can 
achieve.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Oka
y, and just as a follow
-
up, Apple has enough net cash I think to buy 
Tesla, like more than three times over. Is there anything that Apple does or 
has, besides having more money than they know what to do with, that could 
be helpful in Tesla's mission to acc
elerate the transition to shared autonomy 
and sustainable transport? Could they be the type of firm you could partner 
with, and is this something you could talk to Tim about?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I don't think they want to have that c
onversation, Adam. At least I've 
not heard any indication that they do. Obviously Apple continues to make 
some great products and, yeah, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, 
it's cool. I mean...
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Th
ank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Frank with Robert Baird.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
(23:43) question. Can you walk me through what your capital needs are for 
the Model 3 just to get to producti
on and then to ramp production 
throughout this year and next year. And then how confident are you that 
you might be able to hit that 100,000 unit production target for the Model 3 
in this year? And then I have a follow
-
up after that.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla M
otors, Inc.
 
I don't think we have indicated the 

 
we've just said in the letter we'd 
achieve 5,000 per week at some point this year, and 10,000 at some point 
next year. So we haven't clarified on that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, the trick i
s that when you got a whole new product and a whole new 
factory, trying to predict exactly what that initial S
-
curve, the initial portion 
of the S
-
curve looks like is extremely difficult. Inevitably, the production 
starts off slowly and then you gradually 
eliminate the constraints and 
eventually it starts taking off exponentially. But because of that, sort of 
initial slow ramp that then grows exponentially, a small change in where that 
lands in the quarter can have quite a big impact on total volume. It's a
 
lot 
easier to predict where the upper flat portion of the S
-
curve is likely to be, 
but predicting the rapidly changing portions of the S
-
curve is I think not 
within the ability of anyone to predict with accuracy.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co
., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
Got it. And then can you just run us through what the capital needs are? 
Sort of hit that 10,000 unit per week goal, as well as where the battery 
factory stands in terms of its current capacity versus its expected total 
capacity, and what the timeline is to get to that total capacity mark?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, we think pretty good overall about the capital needs and our ability to 
fund that, to achieve that 10,000 per week capacity...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
With internal.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, with internal, right. Exactly. With our own resources and the cash that 
we generate in our business as we ramp up Model 3 volumes. And overall, 
and JB can speak up more to that in 
terms of the cell capacity. That's all 
lined up to come online just ahead of our needs on the vehicles side as well 
as on the energy storage side.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
And we initially forecast about 35 gigawatt hours of cell capacity, and
 
50 
gigawatt hours of pack capacity, and we anticipate to surpass that cell 
capacity in 2018. So, that's going well, and with the increasing 
improvements in the production density and speed at the Gigafactory, we 
actually ultimately believe, and I think we
've said this before, that we can fit 
substantially more capacity than 35 gigawatt hours at Gigafactory 1.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, and we said publicly that we think cell upward capacity at Gigafactory 
1 is likely to exceed 100 gigawatt 
hours over time.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
So yeah, so the end status of 35 gigawatt hours is really a passing point at 
this stage, and we'll continue on from there.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Bai
rd & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth

Right, okay. And just, Elon you had previously pulled out a target of a million 
cars per year by 2020. Do you still think that's achievable? And what needs 
to take place in order to get there?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Te
sla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I do. I think we need to come out with the Model Y sometime in 2020 
or aspirationally late 2019. And then I think that a million units is quite 
likely, combined, yeah. Maybe more.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman 
Sachs.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Well, great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Wanted to first just ask about the 
order rates for t
he Model S and the Model X in the quarter, and also get 
some color around your deliveries from a regional perspective. I believe 
there was an expiration of an electric vehicle tax credit in Hong Kong, just 
wondering if that created any pull
-
forward or incr
emental demand in the 
quarter, and if there's any air pocket to orders and deliveries for the second 
quarter, seeing that you maintained your 47,000 to 50,000 1
-
H delivery 
guidance?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, there was some pull
-
for
ward demand in Hong Kong. That's 
one city on Earth, so it's really not going to impact our ability to achieve our 
delivery targets for Q2.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
And the order rate growth for the quarter?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc
.
 
Well, I think, we feel pretty good about achieving the sort of the 100K 

 
roughly 100K total for the year for Model S and Model X, combined. That's 
where we kind of want to be. The manufacturing system and the supply 
chain is all sort of set up for that 
level. We continue to be surprised by how 
sort of frankly naïve people are 

 
a lot of people are about production and 
supply chain. It's as though there is some like easy way to increase 
production. It's truly not. Any given production system, you design i
t for 
optimal output and then you aim to improve efficiency, reliability, quality, 
and so forth at that output. But the Model S and Model X system as we said 
last year, was designed for 100,000 units, and now initially to get to that 
rate, we have to use a
 
lot of overtime, a lot of expediting, and that affected 
our gross margin on the car. And now we're sort of at steady state with kind 
of the top part of that S
-
curve that we're targeting. And so now focus for 
Model S and Model X is improving production eff
iciency, continuing to 
improve quality and...
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Internal costs.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, and internal costs and so forth to sort of and to get the automotive 
gross margin of Model S and Model X to 
the 30% level that we've been 
aspiring to for a while.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Understood that's on the production side. My question was just on what the 
order rates and demand was looking like from what you're seeing on your 
customer base? 
Historically you've given or provided very helpful color on 
what the year
-
over
-
year or quarter
-
over
-
quarter order growth rate has been 
on the Model S and Model X, and I think, it's a meaningful metric for what 
demand looks like for those vehicles and for y
our products. But okay, 
understood.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I don't think it's meaningful. Like we're going to produce 100,000 units 
approximately. So, all that matters is there going to be demand for 100,000 
units? I believe there will be, or
 
there is.
 
Jonathan McNeill

Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
And there's certainly sufficient demand for the guidance we've given for the 
first half.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Understood, and just on the SolarCit
y side. It looked like a pretty good gross 
margin quarter, wanted to understand how much of that was from the shift 
further into the cash loan versus the PPA lease and how much was that, or 
was it more associated with the ramping of the Gigafactory and pro
duction 
of the cells?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, it was primarily seasonality. We had normal production happening in 
the northern hemisphere in some of the PPA leases and how we recognize 
revenue. And also it was we had some $14 million sale o
f energy credits that 
helped us. And the credit sale happen every quarter, but we had the full 
quarter of it, which we didn't have in our half
-
quarter of SolarCity sales 
financials in our Tesla income statement.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
And yo
u've actually seen an increase in the cash and loan that increased the 
margin as well.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yes, that does help the margin as well, yes.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
I'm sorry to ask one more. But that was a bit inaud
ible, could you repeat 
that?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, we've also seen an increase in the cash and loan business.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thank you very much.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
We're going to get to major
ity cash and loan by the end of the year.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Correct.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
So just to be clear, (33:30) the objective is to get to majority cash and loan 
by the end of the year.
 
Deepak Ahuja

And we expect Solar margins to stay very healthy for the rest of the year, 
and grow over time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Martin Viecha with Redburn.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Hi, this is Martin from Redburn. I wanted to ask about the TED Talk that you 
had few days ago where you talked about Level 5 maybe in the next two 
years. And I was wondering that it's probably going to change radicall
y the 
design of the car inside, and whether you foresee this in the next three 
years that the interior design would change quite dramatically?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I don't think we're going to see dramatic change in interior design. Maybe a
n 
option where you have club seating instead of everyone facing forward, but I 
wouldn't call that radical. Yeah, just turn the seats around.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Okay.
 
<: I'm not sure how much people will actually want to do that.
 
Jonathan
 
McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
The sensor hardware and compute power required for at least level 4 to level 
5 autonomy has been in every Tesla produced since October of last year, 
approximately. So it's a matter of
 
upgrading the software, and we can reach 
level 5. And if it does seem that we need to upgrade the compute power, it's 
designed to be easy to upgrade, basically access it through the glove box 
and plug in a more powerful computer, so we don't think it will
 
be, but if it 
is, that's pretty easy to do. So the important thing to appreciate is that the 
sensor hardware and wiring harness is necessary for full autonomy, which is 
essentially having the eight cameras, the radar, and ultrasonics, that's in 
place, so 
with each passing release, the car's autonomy level will improve. 
We had a bit of a dip, obviously because of the unexpectedly rapid transition 
away from MobilEye, where we would expect it to have the MobilEye chip on 
the board as we transition, but MobilE
ye refused to allow that, so then we 
had to basically recreate all the MobilEye functionality in about six months, 
which we did.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Okay. And then the other follow
-
up question that I had was on the Model Y. 
You mentioned 
that the Model 3 production line will be probably as fast, or a 
bit faster than the fastest production line in the world. And Model Y will be a 
genuine step change. Does that mean that the Model Y will be made on a 
different platform than the Model 3.
 
Elon
 
Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
It will be, yeah. Different platform. I'll tell you...
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think I've given this example before, but it's just one example, but the 
wiring harne
ss on Model S is about 3 kilometers in length. The wire harness 
on Model 3 is 1.5 kilometers in length. The wiring harness on Model Y will be 
100 meters. And that's a redundant wiring harness.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
It's not really a wiring harness, it's basically a flex harness with a high 
DataRay bus, so you can put everything on a higher DataRay bus that isn't a 
CAN bus where your DataRay is massively constrained. And we'll also make 
changes to t
he vestigial voltage so not everything's 12 volts, which is a 
pretty absurd number, really it's wrong for everything.
 
Martin Viecha

Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
 
Guys. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barcl
ays.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes, I have a couple of questions. A house
-
keeping one, and then sort of 
where are you kind of question for Elon. On the housekeeping, your order 
delivery announcements at the end of the quarter, I mean 
delivery 
announcements, you used to talk about deliveries to end customers. This 
quarter it was just deliveries to customers. Is there any change in 
distribution channels potentially using resellers in some markets that that's 
meant to communicate?
 
Jonatha
n McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
No, it's the same thing. It's consistent. We are delivering to end individual 
customers.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. Second, a couple years ago when the stock was at $200, in answer to 
one of my questions,
 
Elon, you outlined a scenario where you could get to 
$700 billion in market cap. That's about where Apple was at the time. We're 
two years later, you're obviously close to the Model 3 launch, how are you 
looking at that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, In
c.
 
Well, now I may want to preface this by of course I could be completely 
delusional, but I think I see a clear path to that outcome.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. And anything else in terms of other businesses or volume, or still 
pretty
 
much on that track?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
The set of steps necessary to achieve that outcome seems pretty obvious. I 
am heavily involved in Tesla going 

 
incredibly good at the machine that 
builds the machine. Which involves, by the way, a 
tremendous amount of 
software. This is not just a bunch of robots that are sitting there. It's the 
programming of robots and how they interact. And it's far more complex 
than the software in the car. I mean, I think, this is just going to be a very 
difficu
lt thing for other manufacturers to copy. I would not know what to do 
if I were in their position.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay, and just one quick question. Why pickup trucks? Why semis before 
pickup trucks?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motor
s, Inc.
 
Well, they're not going to be that widely separated in time. And I think part 
of it is we do want to show that electric transport can do even the most 
heavy duty things in the world, so I think it's pretty obvious we could pick
-
up trucks. But it's 
not obvious to a lot of people that you can do a heavy 
duty semi. And so just being able to kind of hit the corner of the box 
capability, it's just a helpful thing to do. Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Maybe another point, but a disproporti
onate amount of petroleum is actually 
burned by a small number of trucks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Just because of the high utilization and the high miles per vehicle, and they 
really 
lend themselves I think well to electrification.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly. For every semi, I mean, it's probably 10 times as much 
hydrocarbon saved for a semi as for a pickup truck.
 
Brian A. Johnson

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. 
Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. Couple of remaining questions. Just one is since the Model 3 
is maybe two or three months away, could you just 
give us a sense of what 
some of the most critical outstanding items are that are going to gate the 
commercial launch timing, and now that there are actual physical test 
vehicles on the road, are there any significant changes happening?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Te
sla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, actually it seems to be we're not really seeing any significant change 
that needs to occur with Model 3. It's coming in as expected as the design 
continuation has predicted. It's been pretty close to the bullseye, and I'm 
not aware o
f anything that would affect our prior statement to that volume 
target.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
So there's nothing outstanding vis
-
a
-
vis tooling, deliveries, or things like 
that that you're still viewing as a critical item with some unce
rtainty?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
There's plenty of things with uncertainty, but I don't know anything that 
would prevent us from starting production in July, and exceeding 5,000 units 
a week by the end of the year.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Se
curities, Inc.
 
Okay, great.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
There may be something that crops up, but I just don't know of what that is 
today.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Got it. Just switching gears to China. Obviously, domestic produc
tion is 
presumably very important to your success in that region. China recently 
suggested that they may relax the rules for foreign ownership, or that they 
intend to relax the rules for foreign ownership, and I was wondering if you 
could just update us on
 
where you stand vis
-
a
-
vis the growth plans there, 
and are there rules for ownership, is that one of the gating factors?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I don't think this is quite the right timing to make any announcements on 
that front, but I would 
expect us to define our plans more clearly by the end 
of this year, more specific to China production.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. Great. And just lastly...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think it's good timing that, I mean, th
e China rule changes are good 
timing.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Got it. And just lastly, unless there's a pretty huge Q2 for CapEx, it appears 
that you're tracking at less than that $2 billion number that you had 
articulated of 
capital spending prelaunch of Model 3. Is that a function of 
savings, contractual timing, or is that a capacity issue? Just some thoughts 
on how we should be thinking about the capital spending relative to your 
prior targets?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, I
nc.
 
Yeah. It's not too far from it, Rod. And we will have significant CapEx in Q2, 
and it's all in a big lump sum or with a big peak, given how much equipment 
is being installed and then tested. Often our CapEx payments happen, and a 
big chunk of the final
 
payments happen after the equipment is installed, it's 
tested, and then we have fairly good customer payment terms. In many 
cases it's 90 days, and so it's just a matter of that process and time and 
gain, but we feel very comfortable in terms of how that 
is happening, the 
spend and the installation, and overall very nice for Model 3.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, if anyone comes on a tour of the factory, it's really insane 
how much equipment is arriving and getting installed and being 
brought 
online. And I'm used to seeing a lot of intense equipment. It blows my mind, 
like, wow. And I think you can also get a kind of a visual sense for the 
improvement in manufacturing technology between Model S and Model X 
and Model 3. So you can just g
o look at it and say, ""Yep, that's obviously 
better.""
 
Deepak Ahuja

Yes.

Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with 
Oppenheimer.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Thanks so much. Can you give us an updat
e on the volume of cathode and 
anode that's being produced and shipped from the Gigafactory at this point?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
(46:40) but it's a lot. Yeah, vast amounts. Are you alluding to potential 
material supply constraints? I'm not s
ure what you are getting at.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
I just want to get a sense of the ramp at this point on the cathode and the 
anode at the Gigafactory.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I think it's ramping very rapidly (47:24) bu
t we're not really seeing 
anything that's standing in the way of that.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, and I completely agree, and we're basically tracking slightly ahead of 
where we need to be on vehicles, but that's sort of as was planned.
 
El
on Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
We don't want to be too far ahead or else we'd have a pretty massive 
inventory issue showing up. So we run it in batches, and we run at high 
rates and then pause and validate th
e throughput, but, yeah, it's where we 
expect it to be.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Okay. That's super helpful. And then just shifting...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Can I say, I'd just like to express a note of appreciation to Panasonic
, our 
partner on the cell phone and I think the partnership is working really well, 
and they're doing great stuff.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Okay. And then shifting gears to the purchase accounting adjustments 
related to SolarCity. Can we 
just get a sense of the nature of that? It looked 
like you were going to go through a series of complex assessments over the 
course of the year with the SolarCity acquisition. I just want to understand 
what that $100 million charge was, and how we should t
hink about those 
decisions getting made going forward.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I'm not sure what the 

 
yeah, the $100 million is the change quarter
-
over
-
quarter that you're referring to, and in Q4 

 
and this is arcane 
purchase 
accounting. There was a gain on our purchase of SolarCity that 
was not there in Q1 and there was some revaluation of assets at SolarCity 
that was linked to that purchase. And net of that was the $100 million walk.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Okay
, I'll take the rest of it offline. Thanks a lot, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. What 
do you think are likely to prove 
the biggest challenges or bottlenecks in ramping production to 5,000 
vehicles per week by some point in 2017? And how confident are you in your 
ability to overcome those challenges? And then the shareholder letter also 
ment
ions a run rate of I think 10,000, or approaching 10,000 per week in 
2018, which would maybe seem to indicate some kind of an annual run rate 
of 500,000 or so Model 3s, And then given you're also tracking kind of 
100,000 Model Ss and Model Xs, do you think
 
that type of production can be 
handled out of the Fremont facility, or does your plan assume production in 
another facility as well?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. All of that production is intended to be out of the Gigafactory 1 and 
Fremont. 
So, yeah, we believe that can all be handled here.
 
As far as specific constraints on Model 3, I just don't know of anything that 
really stands out. We've gone to great pains with the Model 3 to design it for 
manufacturing, and to not have all sorts of bell
s and whistles and special 
features that, like for example, with Model X, Model X became kind of like a 
technology bandwagon of every cool thing we could imagine all at once. It's 
like everything all at once. That is a terrible strategy. You really want to
 
start off simple and add things over time, but that was some hubris, a little 
overconfident there. So with Model 3, it's the opposite. We're designing it to 
be easy to make. We've got, I think, a much better supply chain in place 
where we have got the A t
eam from the A suppliers. We didn't have that for 
the Model X or the Model S. And as far as we know, there are no issues. So 
that strategy appears to be paying off, but there could be something that we 
missed that we just don't know about right now.
 
Ryan B
rinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. And you mentioned production in the Gigafactory. I know you're doing 
some component assembly there for the Model 3, but given that it is on 
track to be the world's largest factory or maybe even the world's largest 
bu
ilding, is it such a stretch to think that you might be able to produce 
vehicles in that facility?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, just in terms of making battery cells, modules, plaques, motors and 
Power Electronics, just on that basis, and of 
course the Powerwall and 
Powerpack, on that basis alone, it was effectively the largest building in the 
world of any kind. I mean, you could put three Pentagons 

 
more than three 
Pentagons 

 
I think four Pentagons? I don't know, a lot just in the 
Gigafacto
ry. It's really difficult to appreciate the magnitude of the structure 
unless you actually visit it, but there's room to expand.

Merrill Lynch
 
Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on the CapEx topic. I mean, 
you guys did kind of fade down your expectation for CapEx ahead of or in 
conjunction with the Model 3 launch from $2 billion
 
to $2.5 billion to $2 
billion. And then the spend this quarter was relatively low, at least relative to 
what the run rate implied. I'm just curious, is there some level of capital 
efficiency that you're coming across and could you possibly be significantl
y 
below this $2 billion number ahead of the launch or into the launch.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
We are always trying to be capital efficient. That is the underlying theme of 
every step we take. And clearly, some of that is part of it. But I think 
overall 
we will be 

 
again, because of this massive scale of payments, whether it's 
last week of June or first week of July, how many hundreds of millions we 
end up paying, it's hard to be precise. It's almost like an escrow of capital 
spend that we're goi
ng through here. So I don't think it's any indication of 
anything else except timing at the highest level, beyond the capital 
efficiency that we're continually working on.
 
John Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America
-
Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. And then a second question. I mean
, the residuals seem to keep 
performing better than you were expecting. Is there any opportunity to 
potentially lower monthly lease payments to drive higher unit volume 
demand going forward?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Actually I think one of 
the traps that the auto industry has got into in the 
past is having unrealistic residuals. And then finding that they're upside 
down, particularly when recession came along. We want to be very cautious 
about falling into that trap. So, yeah, we don't want 
to do that.
 
John Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America
-
Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
And sort of reiterating in advance that our cars have that cars in the past 
have not had, no other car has is that the software keeps getti
ng better. So 
functionality 

 
keep adding more and more functionality to the car even 
though the hardware stayed the same. If you bought Model S four years 
ago, it's way better than when you bought it and that really makes a 
difference for residuals.

Thank you. Our next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer 
Edge.
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Great. Thank you, and good afternoon. On the semi
-
truck just very quickly, 
if I could ask, is the attractiveness of that sort of
 
vertical that you could sell, 
sort of in bulk to fewer customers or more vehicles per customer? And given 
your partnerships in the past, would you envision partnering with a 
manufacturer on that side of the business, or would this be more akin to 
your sor
t of go it alone strategy on the auto side?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
No, we'll manufacture that ourselves, and most of that semi is actually made 
out of Model 3 parts, by the way. It's actually using a bunch of Model 3 
motors without revealing 
too much about the future of it, so we're able to 
use a very high volume vehicle, and then combine several motors to have 
--
 
I think it's actually going to have a very good gross margin like 

 
that's just 
not something that the other 
--
 
it's like you can't
 
do that with a traditional 
truck. So effectively that was just a very compelling product that has low 
unit cost.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. The incremental complexity of building that is much less than it might 
seem.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tes
la Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Because of all the (57:08)
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly.
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
And are we right to think about that, though, as a con
tractual sort of 
opportunity, right? I mean, you go to sort of a handful of fleet operators and 
you could sell sort of more vehicles per customer. Is that the right way to 
think about it?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
That is how it would occur, yea
h. It tends to be a much more of a 
straightforward economic decision for the fleet operators. They just look at it 
and say cost per ton per mile (57:34). And it's like if it's better they'll just 
buy a huge number, and if it's worse they would buy hardly a
ny and we're 
confident it'll be better.
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Okay, great. And then if I just may follow
-
up on the demand questions that 
were sort of asked earlier. Wondering as you're getting more used vehicles 
back into the pipe
line, is there any data to support that you're using those 
vehicles to attract potentially new customer to the brand, or alternatively is 
there data that would suggest that perhaps it could be cannibalizing some of 
the newer vehicles? Sorry to dwell on dem
and, but I just wanted to see if 
there was anything, given now we're a few years on, you're getting a lot of 
vehicles back off lease presumably. If there's any indication there one way 
or the other?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think it's still 
early days, it's still at relatively low numbers, but the 
indication is that we're introducing a new customer to Tesla at those lower 
price points.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly. The demand actually increases really 
exponentially as price 
drops. (58:52) when we looked at it, I think we are looking at the right 
numbers, but the demand at the Model 3 price point appeared to be 
somewhere between 30 times and 70 times higher than at the Model S price 
point. I mean, look a
t it, like there's 100,000 premium sedans sold in the 
U.S. every year. I think we're about a third of that. But there are 17 million 
vehicles in total sold. So premium sedans are like nothing, less than 1% of 
the market. 0.5%.
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer
 
Edge Research LLC
 
So a 7 series customer for your brand new, and a 5 series customer for your 
sort of used is maybe the right way to think about it. Is that fair?

Or a 3 series customer for the used as well, yeah.

Yeah. But it is interesting to consider that the magnitude of

this i
s really 
maybe underappreciated, like consider 17 million cars and trucks sold in the 
U.S. per year, of which only 100,000 are premium sedans and we have a

third market share. If we can replicate that in other segments, the 
results are obvious.

Okay. Before we go on to the next question, I want to do just a time check 
here. We're at the hour mark. We have five more analysts that want to ask 
questions. Do you want to 
go on for a little bit longer, Elon?

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Elon, I think couple years ago you said 
you could envision at some point stepping away from Tesla, as CEO 
anyways, towards the end of the decade a
s Model 3 kind of got up and 
running. As you were likely to be pursuing a lot of these adjacent 
opportunities, clearly a lot still there on the horizon, but now with some 
more of these opportunities being a part of Tesla's business, does that 
change your v
iew of staying actively in place at Tesla longer into the future.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, let me make myself clear, I intend to be actively involved with Tesla 
for the rest of my life. Hopefully stopping before I get senile or too 
crazy, I 
don't know. But essentially for as long as I can positively contribute to Tesla, 
I intend to have a significant involvement with Tesla. But that doesn't mean 
I should be CEO forever. I think my main 

 
the most valuable thing I could 
contribute is 
kind of product design and technology, but that's my forte; 
that's what I like doing, and that's what I imagine doing in the sort of very 
long term.

Yeah, good evening. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had just two questions. 
One, Elon, at the TED Talks, and I think in a couple tweets you had talked 
about add
ing three Gigafactories, just following up to Tyler Frank's question 
on CapEx needs. Can you just talk about what your ultimate vision of Tesla 
over the next few years, Model Y factory, truck factories, truck service 
centers, three Gigafactories, China exp
ansion. Is all of that going to be 
funded with internal cash, or do you see partnerships funding despite the 
low margins that the battery industry has. I'm just trying to get a sense of 
what your ultimate vision will cost.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, I
nc.
 
Right. It's incremental dilution along the way. It's hard to say. I mean, I'm 
sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future. It's kind of 
a tradeoff between how fast do we want to grow versus like we can grow 
slower with no dilution,
 
really. For sure we could grow at a moderate pace 
with no dilution. We could grow at a fast pace with some dilution. Or we 
could grow at a very fast pace with a high level of dilution.
 
Jeffrey Osborne

10x growth in three years sounds pre
tty fast to me, but maybe not to you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, yeah, but you have to look at say going from 

 
when we went from the 
Roadster to the Model S, we went from making around 500 units a year to 
making 20,000 units a year. So tha
t's a hell of a growth by a factor of 40.
 
Jeffrey Osborne 
-
 
Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Got it. Maybe just in the interest of time, the second question I had is just 
on it would be helpful given that there's hundreds of thousands of people 
that have put their deposit 
on the Model 3. Can you just update us on what 
the cumulative U.S. vehicles sold that you have relative to the 200,000 
number to get that $7,500 tax credit? You mentioned elasticity of demand at 
certain price points and certainly there's a large contingent
 
of people that 
put a deposit that unfortunately won't get that benefit. So it'll be nice just to 
be able to track that metric, so as the Model 3 launches in the coming 
months, we can see which folks will get that, and what the impact the 
demand is for tho
se that don't.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think most people are going to be able to get it that have put down a 
deposit. And, yeah, it's sort of the credit rolls off 

 
it's not like a complete 
(01:05:19) rolls off over time. And we are prioriti
zing U.S. production, which 
also helps us to keep things simple because we're not making many versions 
of the car for many different countries. Yeah, so I mean I think provided 
some of these 

 
I don't know, I guess it's probably most people putting 
down a 
deposit would be able to get the full tax credit.
 
Jeffrey Osborne

Is there a way you could just give us what the cumulative numbers thus far 
in the U.S. quarter to date 

 
sorry, inception to date?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
No. 
Here's the problem, if we do that, then people run off and make all sorts 
of conclusions based on that that are not predictive of the future, because 
you can't test drive Model 3. If you come into our stores and you want to 
buy a Model 3, you could buy a M
odel S or Model X instead. We antisell the 
Model 3. But our net reservations continue to climb week after week. No 
advertising, antiselling, nothing to test drive, still grows every week.

All right.
 
Deepak Ahuja

Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
And maybe we will probably under the present regime, the federal income 

 
the tax credits on the car continue even after we hit the 200,000 limit. And 
they continue for several quarter
s but at a slightly lower, depleting scale, so 
it's going to be beneficial for customers even beyond the 200,000 mark.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, absolutely. And I should perhaps touch again on this whole notion of 

 
it's almost like over t
he years there's been all these sort of irritating articles 
like Tesla survives because of government subsidies and tax credits. It 
drives me crazy. Here's what those fools don't realize. If Tesla is not alone in 
the car industry, but all those things woul
d be material if we were the only 
car company in existence. We are not. There are many car companies. What 
matters is whether we have a relative advantage in the market. And in fact 
the incentives give us a relative disadvantage.
 
Tesla has succeeded in spi
te of the incentives not because of them. But 
these incentives have limited lifetime and limited scale. Like, for example, 
the federal tax credit and then that caps out of the 200,000, the CARB 
credits, which, because the CARB rules are relatively weak, we
 
can sell 

 
there are some quarters where we can't even sell CARB credits. And when 
we can, it's maybe $0.50 on a dollar or something like that, whereas the 
other car companies get to fully absorb the value of the CARB credit. So just 
for example gives GM 
roughly 

 
from my count, $7,000 to $10,000 
advantage over Tesla for their Chevy Bolt.
 
That's why you shouldn't ask like why, well, GM appears to be losing 
$10,000 a car on the Bolt. No, they're not. They are making it up on CARB 
credits. But they get the f
ull retail value of the CARB credit, whereas we get 
the wholesale value when we're lucky. But the CARB credits are only 
effective at a production rate of about 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year. So 
that's why you'll see, mark my words, it's not going to be 
any higher than 
that for the Chevy Bolt. That's on order of 25,000 units a year, or 0.10% of 
our initial production rate for the Model 3, or 0.05% of what Model 3 will be 
next year.
 
So Tesla's competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away. This 
continues to be something that is not well understood. And for that sake 

 
I 
hope somebody doesn't mention those Nevada tax credits, which for the 
Gigafactory, it makes it sound like we got a $1.3 billion check from the State 
of Nevada. We did not. Those t
ax credits are made up 

 
the vast majority is 
just sales and use tax abatement on equipment in the Gigafactory. Taxes 
that otherwise wouldn't have been there because there was just a bunch of 
rocks there before. And you don't get a lot of taxes from rocks.
 
So that's 
why it's essentially a no
-
lose proposition for the state. And in order for us to 
actually earn $1.3 billion in tax credits for the Gigafactory, we have to 
generate over the course of 20 years about $100 billion in output from the 
Gigafactory. So
 
it's worth about like 1%. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth 
and we appreciate it, and that's nice. But this is obviously 1% is not the 
difference between success and failure output of the factory. But a lot of 
articles provided it in the past tense. Te
sla received $1.3 billion. No, we 
haven't. We did not receive that. If somebody wants to send us that, great 
we'll take it. But looking at the bank now I don't see it there. That's because 
it's just sales and just tax payment over 20 years. So the key take
away is 
that Tesla's competitive advantage improves with scale. It doesn't get 
worse.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC 
Capital 
Markets.
 
Joseph Spak

Thanks. Just a quick one on service. By our math, the cumulative number of 
vehicles you delivered and the amount of storage and service stations are a 
little bit over 

 
are something around 700 per, I 
guess, station, and I realize 
you're adding some more of these mobile units, but I just wanted to know 
bigger picture, how you think about coverage in a more steady state or at 
least at a 0.5 million unit rate? Like, what is the right level of coverage 
nee
ded for the larger fleet?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think rather than thinking about store or service center locations, we think 
about it in terms of mobile units and lifts. And so we are building larger 
service centers over time that have mo
re lifts, or our initial service centers, 
it might have had two or three lifts, and we're building now service centers 
with 40 lifts to 60 lifts, sometimes 80 lifts. And so there's a density within 
the service centers but the mobile capability expands that
 
quite greatly. So I 
think a lot of people do incorrect analysis to take cars and service divided by 
locations because the locations vary so widely, but that's essentially how 
we're thinking about capacity and planning capacity. And as Deepak 
mentioned ear
lier, our throughputs and efficiency are getting much better 
over time, and we'll continue to improve those. So it's our goal to stay 
ahead of the install
-
base capacity so we're providing great service, but really 
the Model 3 has been designed for higher r
eliability, and as Elon has said 
many times, the best service is no service at all.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Exactly. Our aspiration would be we make zero service revenue because the 
car never breaks.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Absol
utely. That our service centers are sort of like the old Maytag 
repairman.

Hi, thank you very much. Two quick ones, I guess, if I could. One just on 
energy. Your megawatt hours declined sequentially, which just seemed 
surprising, thinking demand's well above supply still at this stage, so when
 
we would expect any more meaningful ramp there. And then separately on 
automotive, given that you seem to be in the mood to talk about future 
unveils, which is great, any chance I could push that by asking about the 
future urban transport bus 

 
I'm not su
re what you want to refer to it as, 
but the reason I ask is because that one seems a lot less about the product 
and more about just a completely different model for transportation and 
requiring full autonomy and that sort of thing. I mean, is that the kind
 
of 
thing you're thinking three years from now or 10 years from now or anything 
in between? Thank you very much.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Sure. With respect to the battery stuff, it's a little lumpy right now because 
we had a big inflation in f
ourth quarter with Southern California Edison. And 
then we had a bit of a gap between the Powerwall 1 and Powerwall 2. So we 
should start to see that correcting in, Q2, Q3, and particularly, towards the 
end of this year I would expect quite a dramatic ramp
 
in storage 
deployment, like really dramatic.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, and it's worth pointing out that we do still have a significant backlog in 
Powerwall demand, and we're building capacity to address that and ramping 
it. We had a few 
challenges in parts of the supply chain as we've been 
ramping that throughout the quarter, the first quarter, but those are freeing 
up, and we're seeing the production rates improve week on week. But it's 
not indicative of demand. It's really our challenge
s in ramping the new 
products.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Like I said, we feel really good about quite dramatic quarter
-
over
-
quarter increases that I think look every quarter I can imagine in the future 
it's going to be really dramatic incr
eases in stationary storage output. It'll 
grow faster than the car volume, and the car volume is growing pretty fast.
 
Robert Cihra

Okay. And the bus?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
On the bus, yeah. Having given a bit more thought to it, I don't know if the 
bus thing, if that's actually going to be something that makes sense in a 
shared fully autonomous environment because if you have a share 

 
it costs 
very little, like it costs les
s than a bus ticket to make use of a shared 
economy fleet to go wherever you want point
-
to
-
point. Well, why don't you 
just use that? So I don't know. I don't know if the bus thing, it does have 
the density to some degree, but then you could basically have 
something 
like a higher
-
density Model X or something like that that's got the 10 or 12 
seats in it. Would you want more than that? I don't know. And when you 
(01:18:20) then the density in traffic I think can be fully alleviated with 
tunnels. Yeah, it's ki
nd of like the tunnel thing that we talked a little bit 
about that at TED and interesting to see like the commentary afterwards 
was 

 
it was like the critics or the critical commentary was 

 
there's a group 
that thinks that the whole, sort of, automated tu
nnel with electric 
(01:18:45) basically like the tunnel thing 
--
 
there's a group that says it is 
obvious, and there's a group that says it's impossible. And I would like those 
two groups to meet. It's a bit like sort of like there's a group that is like a 
Flat Earth Society and the Hollow Globe Society, I think they should meet 
too. Have a debate.

'hollow', 'globe', 'society', 'think', 'meet', 'debate']"
2/12/16,Tesla,"Thank you. I think the newsletters largely speaks for itself, but I'll add some 
commentary on some of the lead points. Firstly, we had a huge increase in 
Model S deliveries year
-
on
-
year in Q4 last year, going up 76%. We had a 
huge change in our core 
operational cash flow, which you can really see on 
the chart. It's really quite dramatic. That's why I think it's interesting to look 
at in chart form, it goes from negative to significantly positive in Q4 last 
year.
 
And then we made modest improvements in
 
Model S gross margin, gained 
about 25%, excluding one
-
time items, and I feel pretty good about where 
we're tracking to probably get close to 30% by late Q4 of this year.
 
And then something I'm personally quite excited about is that we expect to 
be positiv
e cash flow starting next month and then continuing on into Q2 
and beyond. And there's one caveat there, that's including the asset
-
back 
line, and the asset
-
back line is 

 
that's just funding for cars that are en route 
to customers. So, particularly as sal
es to international markets increases, 
there's more finished goods inventory on its way to customers.
 
So, inclusive of the asset
-
back line, which I really, I think is most accurately 
regarded as a slight decrease in the gross margin of the car by about 
rou
ghly 0.1% or thereabouts, far from that, it requires a cash flow.
 
And then we're expecting to be profitable for 2016 on a non
-
GAAP basis. And 
I personally think that that is actually the correct way to think, to look at it, 
because of the way that GAAP tre
ats lease accounting. But nonetheless, 
despite the lease accounting stuff, we anticipate it being profitable by GAAP 
standards in Q4 of this year.
 
And we're really looking forward to the unveiling of the Model 3 at the end of 
next month. I think this is go
ing to be really well received, and then getting 
into production and delivery at the end of next year.
 
Touching on a few things that are in the bulk of the newsletter, I think the 
chart on vehicle demand is really interesting, and to the degree that this 
r
epresents a microcosm of how Tesla vehicles will be received in other 
vehicle segments, it augurs extremely well for the future.
 
The Model S was the best
-
selling premium sedan in the United States last 
year, of any kind. And our sales actually increased by
 
51%, whereas 
everybody else's sales declined and the overall market segment declined by 
about 1%.
 
So, I think this is, it's really rare to see situations like this. And I think this is 
despite us being really quite under
-
penetrated in the Northeast. I thi
nk 
there's a lot of room for growth in the Northeast, in particular, particularly of 
the U.S., and in international markets, in general.
 
But essentially getting to 25% market share of all premium sedans in the 
U.S. is, I think, a great achievement of the T
esla team. And I think it's also 
great for the world, because it means, I mean, that's 25,000 fewer gas 
guzzlers that are on the road.
 
We'd like to thank all the customers that went out and bought that car, 
because I think they're making a difference for t
he environment; and, of 
course, they're helping pay for the future development of the Model 3, which 
is the more affordable mass market car. That's where we put all of the 
revenue we received from the Model S and Model X. So, it's always a point 
to bear th
at in mind, that Model S and Model X (6:51) the Model 3.
 
And one additional note is that Tesla does not advertise. We don't pay for 
any endorsements. We do not discount our cars for anyone, including me. I 
pay the full retail price. Whereas, those actions 
are 

 
all of our competitors 
take those actions. So that's, I think, quite interesting. We also have far 
fewer sales outlets than our competitors. So, essentially there's a lot of 
degrees of freedom that we are not exercising that we could in theory 
exerci
se.
 
And if you look at the text, it's worth noting that this is not just uniquely 
true in the United States, but in Switzerland, the Model S outsold the 
Mercedes S class, the BMW 7 series, Porsche Panamera, and the Audi R8 
combined. And also outsold the Me
rcedes E class. And in Germany, we 
outsold the Porsche Panamera. So, I think these are pretty good situations. I 
mean, this is even in places that have no incentives. Obviously, incentives 
are something helpful. They're a catalyst for sales. Tesla always a
ppreciates 
the incentives, and I think they make a difference in accelerating the advent 
of electric vehicles. But sometimes, incentives are characterized as 

 
it's sort 
of all about incentives, or not at all about incentives, and it's really 
important to 
appreciate that incentives are an accelerant. That's the reality 
of it.
 
Jason, do you want to add anything?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure, absolutely. Thanks, Elon. First of all, I look forward to working with 
everybody. I'm super 
excited to be here, as excited as I was on the first day 
I walked through the door. Just three quick things I want to touch on real 
quick.
 
Number one, gross margin. Lots of moving parts this quarter, and let me 
walk you guys through it a little bit. We had
 
over $67 million in Model X 
ramp
-
up costs and non
-
recurring items in the quarter, as Elon mentioned. 
Correcting for these items, automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits 
would have been 25%. First thing, the major component here is labor and 
overhea
d and depreciation related to the Model X launch. The way for you all 
to think about this is towards the end of Q3 and into Q4, we had to bring the 
workforce into the factory to build these wonderful vehicles. Also as soon as 
starter production starts, the
 
clock starts hitting on depreciation as well. So, 
that's what's going on there.
 
We also had some asset impairments, one with our old paint shop. And 
we've now got a state
-
of
-
the
-
art paint shop in place, which is going to give 
us the capacity that we need 
all the way through Model 3.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, that's 10,000 cars a week, too.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yep, 10,000 cars a week. So this is a good story. And these are assets that 
we had purchased, I'
ll go all the way back to the NUMMI days, so we got 
every bit of life out of those assets as we possibly could.
 
The other big piece here is, we had an E&O write
-
off, excess and 
obsolescence. This is a result of better production control and inventory 
manag
ement systems that we put in place. The place is moving really fast, 
and we took some time. Elon talked about this in Q2 on the earnings call 
during the shutdown, putting better systems in place to track this. We're 
moving to a place where we're tracking E
&O on a real time basis, and 
bringing those facts to the table when we're making decisions. So, we 
shouldn't be in this position again.
 
Next thing, I wanted to talk about just real quickly was cash flow, and Elon 
covered this, and I think, the chart on the
 
face of the shareholder letter 
really gets there. But, we were within striking distance of positive operating 
cash flows (10:50). And when you add back the leasing proceeds that we 
get of, $209 million, it's a great step change in the right direction to g
etting 
us to net cash flow positive.
 
Also, CapEx, we guided at $500 million last quarter on the call and we closed 
out at $411 million for the quarter. That all resulted in the ending cash 
balance being at $1.2 billion, which I think showcases our strong 
i
mprovement in cash management and discipline in the company.
 
Finally, really quickly talk about capital structure. We closed the warehouse 
line that we previously had before and opened the ABL, as Elon mentioned. 
Think of this as a shift to lower cost fina
ncing. We've got a better deal on 
this line. So, I think it's a better way to think about that, intended uses; 
one, we'll continue to monetize our direct leases, as we did, with the 
warehouse line; but it also creates an option for us to finance our ramp i
n 
FGI as the Model X hits full production scale.
 
I'll just close by saying my mandate from Elon is clear. Cash is king. And 
there's some real steps that we're taking as a company to get ourselves to 
net cash flow positive for the year.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Ch
airman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And profitability.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
And profitability. One more is just capital efficiency and CapEx. CapEx in 
2016, as we've said in the past will be less than it was in 2015. We started 
to see 
some of this in Q4. It will continue. We're also getting to a point 
where we have operating leverage in the business. We'll continue to 
aggressively manage our growth and expenses. And then finally, and I'll 
walk around and I'm on this every day, it's the 
relentless focus on 
automotive unit cost reductions. So, that's my mandate. Again, I'm happy to 
be here.
 
And Elon, if you've got nothing else, we go to Q&A.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, actually, I guess one other point that's
 
sort of interesting to note is 
that Tesla is approximately doubling its cumulative sales every year. So, I'm 
not sure if this has happened in the car industry for maybe a century, but 
like we started at the beginning of last year with 50,000 cars on the r
oad, 
then we ended with 100,000. This year, we're maybe 60% to 80%, we're at 
the high end of the range. Again, it sort of potentially doubles the size of the 
fleet. And I think that's pretty exciting and unusual. So thank you.
 
We can go to Q&A.
 
Jeffrey K.

All right, Latif, let's take the first question, please.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Yes, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, In
c.
 
Welcome, Jason. Just wanted to ask a couple questions revolving around the 
cash flow. I'm sure other will go into some of the Model X ramp and delivery 
numbers. First, you produced about 14,000 vehicles, you delivered 17,000 
vehicles. That would imply 3
,443 reduction in finished goods at least Model S 
inventory, which could generate $250 million, yet your inventory is roughly 
flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter. What before we get the K and the Q, are the put 
and takes there?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Office
r
 
Yeah, I think you touched on it. We managed to do a really nice job of 
selling inventory cars at the end of the year.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
But on the balance sheet, the inventory number in cash and inventory 
stayed about the same.
 
Ja
son Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
So, there's a couple of things going on in there. So, one is the finished 
goods, but also doing a nice job on the finished goods inventory, but also 
just the ramp
-
up of the parts that we need to get full production wit
h Model 
X.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay, so it's sort of the work in process on the Model X. Second, can you 
kind of just refresh, could you kind of update us given the change from the 
revolver to the ABL? What is currently drawn on the A
BL? What's the 
available borrowing base? How much of that is, as you think about next year 
going to be used to support increased on
-
balance sheet leasing versus 
increases in finished goods inventory? And what's your remaining, if the 
banks were to come and
 
kind of borrowing base that would be left 
unpledged?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, sure. So, on where 

 
we closed Q4, $135 million fully drawn on it. And 
then, in terms of the borrowing base, there's a lot of detailed numbers 
behind that. 
I think the most important thing to point out here is the 
increase to $1 billion that we did with our banking partners. And then there's 
some restrictions there, and we don't want to max that out, so we're going 
to monitor it carefully and just make sure w
e do the things to do. We don't 
want to live on this drug.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. We have a collection of lenders. So, it's like 

 
hypothetically, if one 
lender, we decide not to split the ABL, then it's distributed. So,
 
it's not a 
(15:53) with lenders is very strong for the ABL, because it's a finished 
product that's going to a known customer. There's no channel to stuff, 
because there isn't a channel. It's just up in transit to customers, primarily 
overseas.
 
Jason Wheel
er 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah. It grows with the inventory balance, against cars that have orders 
placed against them.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
But it sounds like you could draw it even if inventory 

 
finished goods 
inventory was 
flat, could you still draw on it, or does it have to track to a 
direct increase in finished goods inventory?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. Yes, (16:36). Basically it's a finished goods (16:44).
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capita
l, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson

No problem. Thanks for the question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of 
Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., I
nc. (Broker)
 
Thanks so much. So you're coming to 

 
in the next couple of quarters, to the 
end of some of the initial leases on the Model S. Can you talk a little bit 
about your preparations for that and your expectations as we move 
throughout this year, an
d what will happen with those cars, and how many 
of them are actually going to get returned?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. Jon, do you want to talk about that?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
President
-
Global Sales & Service
 
Sure. So, we ac
tually started on that early, and launched a campaign in the 
second half of 2015 to reach out to folks who had cars coming off of lease, 
and one of the attractive things to those folks who were coming off of lease 
is to have a car that's equipped with Auto
pilot, and Autopilot is certainly one 
of the core stories of what's going on here at Tesla. It's really exciting. And 
so, we're finding that folks are willing to upgrade their Tesla as part of this 
campaign, and so we've got a formal program where we're re
ally providing a 
smooth transition period for these cars.
 
In addition to that, we're finding there's a very healthy aftermarket for these 
cars, and the trading values, or the trading values in the market, are 
significantly above our residual reserves on th
e cars, which is giving us some 
flexibility in terms of our financing partners offering very attractive monthly 
payments in loan terms, because the cars are holding 

 
Teslas are holding 
value at a much higher rate than we thought.
 
So I think, the short ans
wer is, we're out ahead of it, and we're getting 
really good reception and conversion from customers who are excited about 
the next generation of Tesla, which is an Autopilot
-
equipped car.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay. Great. And the
n, just the follow
-
up, there's some pretty significant 
legislation updating the Toxic Substances Control Act that passed through 
Congress in December. As you guys look at a lot of the details in terms of 
ramping the Gigafactory, can you talk a little bit a
bout where you're seeing 
its impact so far with the updated substances, and how they might be 
treated as we go forward here?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
This is JB. I can jump in there. We haven't seen any immediate impacts from 
those re
sults or changes. You know, the materials we're using at the 
Gigafactory are not particularly toxic substances.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. The Gigafactory has zero toxic output.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. In terms of large industrial factories, it's an incredibly clean one. 
There's really no air emissions, and the raw materials are largely base 
metals and things like that.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay. Great. I'll follow
-
up off
line. Thanks, guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. 
Your question, please.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hey, everybody. Two quick ones. First, can you confirm reports that Jim 
Keller, 
kind of a legend in the microprocessor world, has joined the company 
to head some Hardware Engineering at Tesla Autopilot? If that's correct, 
does that signal that Tesla might be 

 
moving to design some of their own 
silicone?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & C
hief Executive Officer
 
Well, I think it's public knowledge that Jim Keller's joined. We have a lot of 
talented people that join Tesla all the time. Jim is indicative of that. And 
just, some people get a bit more press than others, but I think the talent 
le
vel that's joining Tesla is really incredible. With regard to the latter part of 
your question, we just 

 
no comment, yeah.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Then just the follow
-
up. On test drives, outside of company
-
sponsored 
events, ki
nd of surprised we haven't seen any full comprehensive 
independent test drives from the major magazines. Is there anything kind of 
preventing, and I think people on the call can understand if there would be, 
of the earlier produced units that maybe you wou
ldn't want released quite 
yet. But is there anything preventing the magazines from gaining access to 
the early vehicles, the Model Xs, and conducting a full road test of the 
vehicle? And if there is, when can we expect kind of some of the first 
reviews, yo
u think? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, we 

 
I mean, I guess, we've not provided cars to the media, because 
the logic is, we 

 
to the degree that we could suppress demand for the 
Model X, we did. So, we took basically ev
ery action we could to suppress 
demand for the Model X, because production wasn't 

 
we need to get 
production up. There's no point in amplifying demand if production cannot 
meet that demand.
 
So, we did our best to really suppress demand, or simply not enco
urage 
demand. That'll obviously change in the balance of this year, as we get cars 
to stores, because there's been no Model Xs at stores, no Model Xs available 
for test drives. But in the coming months, I think probably next month, 
you'll start seeing some
 
reviews in magazines and whatnot. The feedback 
from customers we've gotten has been very positive.

Hi, good afternoon. Wanted to ask you first, can you give us a little more 
color on what exactly happened with the Q4 launch? I mean, in the letter, 
you sort of imply that it took maybe a little bit longer than expected. So
, 
what issues have you encountered? And what have you learned that gives 
you confidence that, in your next launch, maybe the Model 3, you can 
actually ramp that up significantly quicker?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I 
think that's a great question. I think the mistake we made with the 
Model X, which I really think we've taken to heart at Tesla, is that we put too 
many new features and technologies, too many great things all at once, into 
a product.
 
In retrospect, it wou
ld have been a better decision to do fewer things with 
the first version of Model X, and then roll in the capabilities and features on 
new technologies over time, in subsequent years. So I do think that there 
was some hubris there with the Model X.
 
So the 
net result, however, is that I think the Model X is an amazing car. I 
honestly think it's probably the best 

 
I mean, I think it's the best car ever. 
I'm not sure anyone's going to make a car like this again. I'm not sure Tesla 
would make a car like this a
gain.
 
So, yeah, I mean, it's 

 
I mean, I'd be surprised if somebody buys the Model 
X, and particularly as the software gets refined, if it's not the product they 
love more than any product they've ever bought, I would be surprised.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Ch
ief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, maybe it's worth also just commenting that even some of the most 
innovative features on Model X that caused some challenges in Q4 have 
really been largely overcome today.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yea
h, that's true.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
The operation of the falcon door, the sourcing and supply of the large glass 
wind screen, I mean, these things are working very well and are not a 
bottleneck at this point.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Exactly. Some of the things that cause us issues are somewhat 
counterintuitive. They're not the obvious things. I mean, for just a few 
weeks, maybe three weeks or four weeks actually, the constraint was the 
chrome finish 
on the bright work around the window, the front window, 
okay? Maybe think, (25:12) a constraint? But it was.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Or seals.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Or seals, yeah. The seals. Yeah, the 
seals have been a huge pain. I mean, 
essentially the seals had to be redesigned, and then the seals that we did 
have had to be reworked by hand in order to sort of fit correctly. Yeah. Seals 
are a bane. We had a lot of issues with the second door seats, we
 
have now 
in
-
sourced that capability. Yeah, we really don't see any fundamental issues.
 
Emmanuel Rosner 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Okay. You sounds like it's basically mostly behind you. So, as we move 
forward into the year, so you're talking about this Model X p
roduction rate of 
1,000 vehicles a week in Q2. Is that an exit trade or is that an average for 
Q2? And can you just more generally give us how you see the overall mix for 
the year of Model S versus Model X play out in terms of deliveries?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, some of the stuff is 

 
you have as good a crystal ball as we do. But, 
let's see, 1,000 a week would probably be a peak production week in Q2. 
Yeah, so like average 

 
I don't know what the average is going to be e
xactly 

 
but maybe 700 vehicles or 800 vehicles, something like that. So that's 
good for that. I think we feel confident of hitting 1,000 a week certainly 
towards the mid to end of Q2.
 
And then for the exact mix, I mean, I think we need to see how customer
s 
react when both cars are in the showrooms, and then we'll adjust 
accordingly. But, we expect to combine the delivery number average over 
the year of 1,600 per week to 1,800 per week.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. 
Your line is open.
 
C
olin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just kind of walk through 
what are the key short
-
term drivers of cash flow, sorry? You're kind of still 
burning $200 million this quarter. Is it just really all volume t
o get back to 
get cash flow positive by Q2? Could you also touch on CapEx? You're saying 
it's going to be flat to down, but there seems like there's an awful lot of work 
going on in the company. I mean, how do you keep CapEx down as you 
have all these grow
th plans?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, sure. So, the key drivers on cash flow positive. So, as I said in my 
earlier comments, it was a great step, and then operational too. The 
business is selling cars and energy products, is now producing
 
enough cash 
for us to start to pay for our investments. And if you look at the Q4 
dynamics, that cash flow from core operations as we're calling it produced 
40% to 45% of the cash that we needed for the CapEx in the quarter. So, 
that is certainly a big pi
ece of it, too.
 
Another piece of it as I mentioned is just going to be operating leverage. We 
need to be very diligent about how we grow operating costs certainly. And 
then the other big element to it is certainly continuing to drive cost downs 
on the vehi
cles.
 
And there's lots of ways to do that. We're getting better at our 
manufacturing processes, we're reducing scrap, we're reducing excess and 
obsolescence. As we talk about in the letter, the car continues to be more 
and more reliable. So, that reduces o
ur warranty, and that actually has a 
cash impact when the cars show up less at the service centers.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. In fact, and can I? I'd just like to re
-
emphasize that. We're seeing 
dramatic 
improvement in reliability and reductions in servicing needs. This is 
important. Sorry. Go ahead.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yep. No, absolutely. And then the other piece you talk about CapEx and how 
can it be down. We made a bulk of the inves
tments that we need for Model 
X in 2015. So, in 2016, we're going to continue to invest, but we're really 
towards the back half of the year, start to see some initial investment in 
Model 3. We continue to invest in the Gigafactory to get to where we want t
o 
be with production there. And then we'll continue to expand the service 
center, the retail locations, and the supercharger network as well. But 
there's a lot of the big pieces that we needed to spend in CapEx to get to 
where we are today were spent in th
e past.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. It's just important to bear in mind that the overall market for SUVs and 
the sedans is roughly the same. Globally, it's split, almost 50/50, and so, the 
Model X is kind of like half of our v
olume. So, if you set a company up to 
produce X, let me use the variable X.
 
If you set a company up to produce a certain amount of revenue and then it 
produces, you know, maybe just over half that amount of revenue, but has 
the cost basis associated with i
t, then obviously, the things will not be pretty 
from a cash flow and profitability standpoint, necessarily, is going to be true.
 
Then as Model X production rises, then that changes, and then we achieve 
the target revenue with the reasonable cost basis and
 
the whole picture 
changes dramatically for profitability and cash flow.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Absolutely. The only other last thing I would add, too, is we've had a 
significant run
-
up investment over the last couple of years. Now, it's t
ime to 
absorb that and look for just greater capital efficiency.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Got it. And just one final question. Could you just remind us, are you still on 
track for storage of $400 million to $500 million this year, and two 
to five 
next year? Or is that still on track?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Hey, JB, do you want to comment on that? I mean, one thing I say with 
respect to energy, we do see this being a very enormous market, but it's an 
exponential
 
growth market, so exactly where the calendar falls on that S
-
Curve exponential makes quite a big difference on revenue. So, it will be 
heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. JB, do you want to add anything?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. That's exactly right. It's not a linear extrapolation throughout this year 
at all, so, you know, I think we're being fairly cautious in trying to make 
sure that we don't overpromise here and understand what's going to happen 
in Q4. It's a little bit 
tricky to know how that will grow.
 
Production is in on track and we feel really, really good about that. 
Production start off as planned in the Gigafactory in Q4. Deliveries are on 
track. We're starting shipments of Powerwalls and Powerpacks worldwide, 
and
 
we're growing out the sales operations and sales teams around the 
world. From an execution point of view, I think we feel really good with 
where we're at. It's early days to predict how exactly that exponential 
growth is going to really integrate.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of 
Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Good aft
ernoon, and I guess, good evening from our 
end. Wanted to build just on Emmanuel's question. Can you just tell us, 
what is the current run rate of Model X production, you know, where we 
stand today, towards the middle of February? And can we talk a little 
bit 
about how you get to the ramp. It sounds 1,000 is the target that would 
obviously mathematically get you to think about half your production. So, 
that's pretty much full ramp, but it seems like that's a pretty big distance 
from where you are now. And m
aybe if we can walk through the pieces that 
get you there, you know, in terms of training employees, getting the supply 
base in order, getting some of the quality issues resolved. That would be my 
first question.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executiv
e Officer
 
I don't think we want to comment with that level of granularity. Unless 
people actually understand how production works, they reach incorrect 
conclusions. We stick to what our projections are, and leave it at that.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman S
achs & Co.
 
Okay. Just in terms of another ramp
-
oriented question, if I may, it does 
seem that given the forecast that you have for, I think, 16,000 deliveries 
this year, getting to...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
This quarter.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
...for this quarter, excuse me, getting to 80,000 to 90,000 would imply a run 
rate that's about 40% higher than where you are in Q1. But you also made a 
comment that inventories 

 
that a lot of that's going to be i
nternational, and 
there may be some, you know, in
-
process inventory being built out to 
service that so maybe we can talk a little bit about that ramp.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. The international stuff is mostly Q2, so that'
s really where the 
international ramp starts. There's still inventory in process for, of course, 
North America, because it takes longer to get a car to the East Coast, if 
there's like a blizzard or something. So, that's a factor in finished goods. But 
fini
shed goods necessarily ramps as we pull the pipeline for overseas sales, 
which is next quarter.
 
Patrick Archambault

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Galves of Credit Suisse. Your 
line is open.
 
Dani
el V. Galves 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA

Thanks for taking my questions. First one has to do with operating expenses. 
Hopefully, I'm not getting the numbers wrong, but it seems like 
20% growth 
in 2016 versus 2015 implies like, relatively flat, versus the Q4 run rate. Is 
that achievable to essentially keep the operating expenses pretty consistent 
throughout 2016?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah. Certainly. This is Jason. W
e definitely believe that we can do that. 
There was a bit of a dog's breakfast in Q4. We had some things in there. I'll 
just give you a couple of examples. We had some aged receivables from 
some service revenues in Europe that we ended up having to write o
ff. That 
was one thing.
 
We had some R&D tooling that had come to the end of its useful life, and we 
had to write
-
off as well. So, there's some noise in the Q4 number for sure, 
but I'm very confident in the projection in the forecast that we've given for 
20
16 relative to 2015.
 
Daniel V. Galves 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA
) LLC (Broker)
 
Okay. Great. Yeah. No problem. One other, if I could. There's been a lot of 
negative chatter about Gigafactory related t
o signing up of other partners, 
precursor partners, supply agreements for access to raw materials, and just 
kind of the general size of the plan. I was wondering if you could give us an 
update on kind of where you stand, and if you see any challenges to ge
t up 
to the, you know, 35 gigawatt hours of cell production by 2020, 50 of packs.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. In general relative to the initial forecasts and timelines, we feel pretty 
comfortable and where we're at. I think there has bee
n a lot of drama and a 
lot of negativity in the reporting on this. Somewhere around the head count 
recently that I think a lot of people picked up on.
 
And maybe just to talk about that one in particular. That recent sort of hiring 
head count discussion que
ued off of numbers that we reported that were 
effective essentially in the middle of 2015. And then those were essentially 
compared against where we predicted to be at the end of 2015. So, they 
weren't even really apples
-
to
-
apples, and our very most recent
 
report that 
we made with the governor's office of economic development, we had 
reported, I think, around 272 net hires for the year at the end of 2015, 
against, we had a target of 300.
 
So, the general plan is executing actually quite closely to what we ha
d laid 
out back in 2014. Because it's a fast growth, we have to be really careful at 
what snapshot in time you actually look at, and what you compare that 
against.
 
We still, you know, have the same confidence. We're still on track to produce 
15 gigawatt ho
urs of cells. I'm sorry, 35 gigawatt hours of cells, and 50 
gigawatt hours of packs. 15 gigawatt of that going to Tesla Energy, the rest 
going to Model 3 and vehicles. That still is on track, and we're on track to 
start cell production towards the end of t
his year.
 
Daniel V. Galves 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA
) LLC (Broker)
 
Thanks very much.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Basically, to the best of our knowledge, you shouldn't worry
 
about the 
Gigafactory as a constraint in Model 3.
 
Daniel V. Galves 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA
) LLC (Broker)
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
That does not appear to be anyw
here near the critical path for Model 3. So, 
yeah. If I can just sort of maybe say a few words about the Gigafactory like 
Nevada, and the incentives, and all that. One of the most (39:52) that I see 
in the media is over
-
representation of the Nevada incenti
ves. The thing to 
bear in mind, for the $1.3 billion in incentives for Nevada is that, in order for 
us to achieve that, we actually have to develop about $100 billion in revenue 
from the Gigafactory. And those incentives occur over 20 years, representing 
a
pproximately a 1% discount on the cost of the Gigafactory.
 
The reason it's a big number, and I should say a disproportionate 

 
it is a 
big number in the absolute sense, but it is disproportionately small relative 
to incentives that, say, Boeing would 
receive for keeping an aircraft factory 
in Washington.
 
The reason it's this big is because the Gigafactory will be the largest 
footprint building in the world when it is done. I'll tell you, (40:54) the 
Fremont factory is currently number two; and, if you'
re curious, number one 
is a flower auction house in The Netherlands. And you can look this up on 
Wikipedia. So, it sort of makes sense that if something is kind of like the 
biggest thing on Earth, it's probably going to have incentives that are big in 
the 
absolute, but small in relative terms.
 
Daniel V. Galves 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA
) LLC (Broker)
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And the fundamental driver of the decision 
that 

 
not the exclusive driver, 
but the primary driver of the decision, was pace of execution for the 
Gigafactory. That was the primary reason for Nevada over other options. 
And I believe that this decision is bearing fruit, because we are seeing it 
move 
at a very good pace.
 
Daniel V. Galves 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA

Okay. Thanks, guys. Welcome, Jason. Sorry.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-

All of those incentives are also perf
ormance based.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, exactly.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
We don't receive them unless we execute along the path towards the 
milestones.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
R
ight. And even some of those we do receive have clawback provisions.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-

Exactly.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-

I mean, essentially 

 
I wrote a blog about this. There is no way for Nevada 
to lose. 
The way that Nevada set up the incentive structure is a no
-
lose 
proposition for them. So, they did an awesome job on behalf of their state. 
You can read the blog that I wrote called ""the house always wins,"" which is 
true. And so, anyway, it's really annoyi
ng to see this stuff misrepresented in 
the press.

next question, please?

Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Good afternoon, guys. Just a first question, and Elon, 
you made a very 
interesting comment about the Model X being the best car ever produced, 
and it sounds like you think it might be better than the Model S. I mean, as 
you get...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Maybe I'm biased. 
Obviously.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Well, I mean, it's your newest car, so it makes sense. Or newest vehicle, I 
should say, so it makes sense. But I mean, as you look at getting that 
production ramped up and availability out there to 
consumers, what would 
the selling point be on the Model S, then? I mean, could you get this mix 
significantly above 50% crossovers or Model X, because the price premium 
is really not that great? Why wouldn't you sell a whole lot more Model X than 
Model S, 
and could you?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I think this is a question of owner preference. I mean, I personally still 
prefer to drive the Model S over the Model X, because I'm kind of a 

 
I like 
the lower position of a sedan.
 
And the Model S, in terms of performance, is 
about 10% better in an acceleration through handling or whatnot than the 
Model X. So, it really depends on owner optimization.
 
If you like sort of a high seating position, an amazing amount of room and 
function
ality and just sort of a feeling of high visibility, I mean, because the 

 
one of the best features, maybe the best feature of the Model X, is the 
cockpit style front windshield, which gives you this amazing panoramic view 
as you're driving.
 
And so if 

 
wh
ich a lot of people like that in an SUV, and so that's what the 
reason that they buy that. So, I think it really depends on personal 
preference, and we'll see what the results are once we actually put the 
vehicle in stores and people take test drives.
 
John
 
J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
And when you think about all the content that you're putting in the Model X, 
and the upgradability of the Model S and the Model X over time, I mean, 
how do you think about planned obsolescence, which is sort of a 
real 
necessary part of almost any business, to generate incremental sales from 
your existing customer base?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I guess, I mean, our view of planned 

 
we don't plan to obsolete things. We 
just relentlessly m
ake things better. So, for example, for the Model S, 
there's an average of 20 improvements per week. Mostly, these are a little 
tiny nuance things that most people wouldn't notice. But, it is a continuous 
improvement process. That's why I say, when people 
say, when should they 
buy Model S? Like what model year? It's like, we don't really have model 
years. We keep improving the car. If you want to wait until the car stops 
improving, you'll be waiting forever.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Ok
ay. And then just one follow
-
up, just on the cash flow for 2016. 
Obviously, a lot of progress has been made more recently. As we think 
about the positive net cash flow and the increase in the cash balance on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis, will that include 

 
I'm 
just trying to be clear 

 
the 
potential draw on the ABL over time, as that's needed to run the business, 
or does that net cash increase not include whatever draw that happens on 
the ABL in 2016?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
That inc
ludes the draw on the ABL, the finance initiatives.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Albertine of Stifel. Your 
question, please.
 
Jamie Albertine 
-
 
Stifel, Nicol
aus & Co., Inc.
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. On the Model 3, if I may, just I think 
a lot of folks are trying to do work as it relates on the margin trajectory over 
time. And it's clearly going to be volume dependent and sort of timing 
around the
 
launch, but I was wondering if you could help us understand, just 
given that it's a third of the transaction price of roughly your initial Model X 
deliveries, what are some of the efficiencies you're hoping that you can sort 
of draw upon, maybe beyond jus
t sort of the battery reduction, battery cost 
reductions? What are you leveraging in the Model 3 from investments you've 
already made, and sort of the knowledge you have around sort of initial 
launch costs on the higher priced vehicles at this point?
 
Elon 
Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I think the way to think of the customers is really that the Model 3, 
being a sedan, is about 20% lighter than 

 
and actually quite a bit less 
complex to manufacturer, than the Model S. Model S was real
ly the first car 
we ever made ourselves. So, it was 

 
we were designing to make it work, as 
opposed to designing it from ease of manufacturing, whereas the Model 3 is 
really designed for ease of manufacturing.
 
And then we expect through economies of scale 
and just general design 
improvements to get another 30% improvement. So that's where the 50% 
improvement comes relative to the Model S. So, it's a sort of 35K versus 
70K of Model 3 versus Model S is the way to think about the difference.
 
And our default pl
an as we've done in the past is that the initial sales are 
relatively highly optioned versions of the car. Because obviously, we've got 
to pay back the investment of all the tooling and everything, so that sort of 
makes sense to have the higher optioned ve
rsions first. So, that's what we 
did with the Model S and also again with the Model X.
 
Although, it was sort of unfortunate that the way the Model X pricing got 
reported that they reported the sort of fully optioned signature series as 
though it was the ba
se price volume number in some publications. So, this is 
just a misunderstanding of how things work. I mean, and I think it's also 
normal to do this in many other industries. Like, if Intel comes out with a 
new CPU or faster CPU, or NVIDIA comes out with a
 
new graphics card, in 
the beginning, it's a lot more expensive and then over time the price drops.

Just a clarification, Elon, on the economies of scale. So, should I think about 
that in sort of the 
running through the paint shop as an example, given you 
said the 10,000 unit per week sort of goal there?
 
And then, separately, should we expect 

 
when should we expect to start 
hearing about the Model 3 production line? Where do you, within the facility, 
plan to build it? At what point? Is it sort of going to be the same lead time as 
we saw with the Model X? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. There will be a production ramp for the Model 3. It's always been 
tricky in the pas
t to predict those production ramps. But yeah. Anything you 
want to ad?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Well, I think in the development plan that we have now, we have 
substantially more time, place holder put into the schedule to really refine 
the
 
product ahead of the production ramp. To a question that came earlier, I 
think that's something we really take into heart in the launch of the Model X. 
As we look to higher volumes, and what we hope will be a steeper ramp with 
Model 3, I think we've learn
ed some important lessons on how to do that 
well, and having a really robust pilot build in the plant and enforcing rigorous 
numbers there.

Thanks for taking my questions, and welcome, Jason. Just a practical one 
about the factory. You have different choke points at different point
s in time. 
It's been general assembly, it's been the cells, at last count it was Body 
Lines 1 and 2. So, I'm just asking about the status of Body Line 2? And 
when you hope to migrate maybe Model S production on to that Body Line?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman

I think we're getting a bit too much into the internal decisions of Tesla. If we 
say something that's related to an internal decision in Tesla, then it can 
over
-
constrain our decisions, and we need to test some flexibility there.
 
So, 
we'd rather not to comment on the details of when different production lines 
are moving around.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Company
 
Okay. And then, maybe longer term, then. What is your updated thinking on 
your cost per kilowatt
-
hour by the end o
f the decade, especially as you 
source your raw materials at the Gigafactory?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
That's quite a sensitive number. It's less than what we see most people 
estimating. So, we see most people overestimating cos
t per kilowatt
-
hour, 
but that is a proprietary number.
 
Andrea Susan James 
-
 
Dougherty & Company
 
And I think in the past you said you'd be disappointed if it was not below 
$100.

question, please.
 
Ryan J. 
Brinkman

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Yes, thanks for taking my call. A question for Jason, probably. Other 
automakers sometimes talk about what they call minimum cash, the amount 
of cash that they need to end the quarter with in order to fund inter
-
quarter 
w
orking capital swings, even the event's total change in working capital 
during a quarter were negligible.
 
I'm curious what you think your minimum cash needs are, and is that 
something you can share with the investment community? And then just 
more broadly,
 
what total amount of cash or gross liquidity do you prefer to 
run the business with? Thanks.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, sure. We don't go over the inner workings of how we do those 
calculations internally, but a billion dollars is a nic
e comfort level. And you 
see we're starting to make the moves on the ABL, and et cetera, to give 
ourselves more flexibility there. And it's reiterated, a comment I made at the 
very beginning, cash is king. And I'm walking around collecting it.
 
Ryan J. Brin
kman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. Great. And then just last question on the Gigafactory. You've already 
given some updates, but maybe you could just talk about how much of the 
planned CapEx for 2016 relates to the Gigafactory, and then maybe an 
update o
n the relationship with your partners there, maybe Panasonic, or 
any others, how those relationships are progressing relative to their 
expected future contributions? Thanks.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. It's a great question, and like you 
said, we're really excited about the 
Gigafactory, and things are on schedule. We're not at this time going to 
break out the detailed CapEx plans. I gave it to you thematically earlier. 
Certainly, Gigafactory towards the end of the year will start to see so
me 
Model 3 investment and then throughout the year we'll see investment in 
sales, service, and the supercharger network.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Maybe just quickly on the Panasonic p
iece they continue to be an excellent 
partner in the project, and I think you've seen probably in the recent months 
additional statements from them with ongoing capital commitments to the 
project. As planned, those are kind of happening in the right sequen
ce. 
They've also started hiring for the project, and training people. So, things 
are going as well as we can hope there.
 
Ryan J. Brinkman

Hi guys. This is Tyler Frank on for Ben. Can you comment on the overall 
expectations for deliveries throughout the year? If we back out (55:16), 
looks like
 
about (55:20) Q2 through Q4, which seems like you should be 
there with production given the Model X expectations and the Model S 
production expectations as well?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes, like I said, I know you'd love to h
ave sort of more granularity, but it's 
difficult for us to give you granularity that we ourselves don't have, that's 
excessive precision. I don't want to give false precision.
 
We feel good about, like, the overall number, but it might be around as to 
how i
t gets to that overall number. And there's always unforeseen things 
that occur. So, that's why we kind of need some flexibility that we don't 
provide false precision, and then people hold us to false precision.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., 
Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
Okay. Thank you. And then can you comment on what you're seeing for 
overall demand in the China market. And then what markets do you expect 
to move into next, which you (56:32)? And how that ramp will go?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, China is not a huge market for us and hasn't been historically. It is 
something we expect in the long
-
term will be a big market, and ultimately 
probably our biggest market. So I think there's a lot of long
-
term 
oppo
rtunity there. So, it's difficult to say what's going to happen with China 
in the short term, except that it doesn't really have a big effect on Tesla yet. 
I mean, long
-
term it will be.
 
In terms of new markets, I'm really excited to launch in Mexico this y
ear. I'll 
be heading out to Mexico City. And I think there's actually quite a bit of 
opportunity there, and some of our customers 

 
we actually do have 
customers in Mexico already, but having a significant presence there I think 
is going to be great. And s
o, our most supportive customers are actually in 
Mexico.
 
Tyler Charles Frank

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth

Okay. Then, a quick follow
-
up. There's been some rumors and commentary 
that the Model 3 launch may not be an actual 
full vehicle. Can you just talk 
about what we should expect at the launch event and at the end of March?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, we're trying to decide whether we should show all the cards or keep a 
few cards close to the
 
vest, I haven't made decision yet.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. You 
question, please.
 
Rod A. Lache

Deutsche B
ank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. You commented earlier, Elon, on the Model S versus the 
Model X demanding personal preference on passenger car versus SUV. And I 
was just wondering if you have any thoughts on whether Model S demand 
would or could be affe
cted once the Model 3 is revealed? Do you think that 
those vehicles ultimately go to different customers, or is there a plan to 
avoid cannibalization there?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I mean, I think there are different mark
et segments. (59:02) BMW 7 
Series and BMW 5 Series and BMW 6 Series, they're a different market 
segment from the Model 3 series.
 
You should think of the Model 3 as sort of really competing in kind of the 
BMW 3 Series or Audi A4 market. And so, if you want 
this sort of opulent 
machine, you'd really want to get the Model S. The Model 3 will be a great 
car.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, maybe also just as an anecdote. There was a lot of concern when we 
launched the Model X about cannibalization
 
of Model S demand. And we 
actually saw just the opposite, which was the increased interest and 
awareness and just customer engagement actually drove higher Model S 
sales even as the Model X was launched. And those are actually much closer 
in terms of vehi
cle capability as we just talked about.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Yeah, yeah. It makes sense. And I was hoping just on the financial side, can 
you give us just a little bit of a sense of how challenging it will be to get to 
that 25% Mod
el X gross margin? And can you comment at all on how you're 
expecting for the overall company gross margins would look this year? Are 
you expecting them to be able to stay above 25%, even with the Model X 
ramping?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Su
re. So, as we said in the letter, 25% by the end of the year for Model X. 
I'm sorry. I'm a little under the weather. And 30% for the Model S. So, you 
can do the math on what the blended rate will look like.
 
In terms of getting to 25% for Model X, we have t
o think about it is, we've 
got many years of history with the Model S right now, and that is learning 
that can certainly be applied to what we're doing with Model X. So, we're 
comfortable that we're going to be able to drive gross margin in the right 
direc
tion with Model X significantly throughout the year.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
In the long run, we expect the gross margins of Model S and Model X to 
converge around the 30% number. They should, in the long run, both be 
around 30
%. That's our target. It's just, as Jason was saying because the 
Model X is a newer vehicle, we're just earlier in the learning curve for the 
Model X than the Model S.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. It sounds like it's not 

 
you're ben
efiting from some learning curves, 
so the margins even initially could be okay north of the 20% range? Is that a 
reasonable expectation, then kind of ramping up to the level? Or is it a more 
challenging kind of ramp?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Exec
utive Officer
 
I mean, I really look at where does it end up, as opposed to what happens in 
the very near term. And it's hard for us to predict exactly where it is in the 
near term. Just think of that sort of S
-
Curve and say like, where are you on 
the S
-
Cur
ve? If you have a rapidly changing slope on a curve, it's really hard 
to say, okay, let's pick a date, because you could move that date by a week 
and have a huge difference.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Right.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & 
Chief Executive Officer
 
That's why it's hard for us to give you an exact number, but we kind of know 
where the S
-
Curve will end up. (62:35) then it gets much more predictable.
 
Rod A. Lache

Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Hull of Bloomberg News. 
Your line is open.
 
Dana Hull 
-
 
Bloomberg
 
Yeah. Hi. Thanks so much. So, as you think out four years to five years to 
2020, when you want to produce 500,000 cars each year, can you
 
get there 
without building another assembly plant or a second Gigafactory?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. Specifically, the Freon plant historically has produced almost 500,000 
cars a year. So, whether it was at GM 

 
sir, we can
 
hear your keys quite 
loudly. When it was Toyota or GM plant, it produced almost 500,000 cars a 
year. We're comfortable that it can get back to that level. And then the 
Gigafactory is designed to support 500,000 cars a year with batteries plus 
have 15 giga
watt hours left over for stationary storage.
 
Dana Hull 
-
 
Bloomberg
 
Okay. So, no need for a second Gigafactory (63:49)?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Correct, no need for a Gigafactory. Correct.
 
Dana Hull 
-
 
Bloomberg
 
And then for Jaso
n, the shareholder letter says you plan to open about 80 
retail locations and service centers and energize about 300 new 
supercharger locations. Can you give us some commentary on where exactly 
those new service centers and retail locations might be? Is it
 
mostly the 
Northeast of the U.S., or also globally?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
I think the general theme is two
-
pronged. We're densifying in markets 
where we already exist, and where demand has increased significantly, 
we've got to put servic
e centers, and we try to actually predict ahead of that 
where we're going to need those.
 
But as Elon referenced, we're opening new markets this year. But I think in 
general, we're going deeper in markets where we are. And in addition, we're 
opening a signi
ficant number of stores in China and in the Northeast of the 
U.S. as we increase our awareness and our share in those markets. But, 
you'll see service centers and retail locations opening across all of our 
markets, including Europe.

Hi. I was hoping maybe you 
could give me an encapsulating feeling on the 
quarter. It's sort of a mixed bag from an outsider's perspective. The losses 
were pretty high and maybe higher than what people expected; but you're 
giving a very aggressive forecast. Do you feel like the compa
ny is on the 
right track, and that you're past some of your hiccups? I guess I'm looking 
for a 40,000

Yeah. I feel very good about things right now. I mean, it was

Mike Ramsey

Okay. And I had wanted to ask a little bit about also your plans for 
consolidatio
n. Dana asked about whether the Gigafactory could handle the 
Model 3. I'm curious, I haven't been there. There's so many folks working 
over there now that aren't even building cars. You have engineers and stuff 
there. Can you give me a little idea about wh
ether and when you might have 
to think about consolidating your operations in the Bay area? Excuse me. I'm 
a little under the weather as well.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I'm not sure what you mean by consolidating. We are kind 
of spread out 
because, in addition to the Fremont factory complex and our headquarters in 
Palo Alto, we do have a number of other facilities in the Bay area. But man, 
I'm not sure how we'd consolidate.

Hi, thanks for taking the call. Considering now that the Chevy Volt is going 
to go on sale at the end of this year, so that'll be a full year that it's on sale 
before 
Model 3 arrives, I mean, has it taken any wind out of your sales, 
and/or do you think, again, that these are very different customers? If 
you're comparing to an Audi A4, for example, are people still going to be 
attracted to the Model 3 even though they'll
 
have that option on the market 
quite a while before the Model 3 arrives?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I mean, I would sort of point you to the market share of large luxury 
vehicles, or large premium sedan sales in the 
U.S. that I talked about earlier 
on the call. We're currently outsell everyone in that category. And had a 
51% market growth last year, where everyone else declined, and the market 
as a whole declined. So, I mean, if Model 3 is at all similar in its market
 
segment, it doesn't seem like we're going to be demand constrained.
 
Dee
-
Ann Durbin 
-
 
Associated Press
 
Okay. And I know you don't do any marketing, but I'm wondering if you 
would ever possibly reconsider that. It struck me when you were saying that 
you are
n't where you could be on the East Coast, and that may be because 
people need some more educating about how the car performs in the snow 
or whatever. Do you think there's ever a point at which you might reconsider 
and do some very targeted marketing in pla
ces where you think you could 
do better?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I don't think it's in the near 

 
I don't think we'll do that in the near
-
term; but in the long
-
term, I think I could see us doing advertising where 
that adv
ertising was interesting, entertaining, and people don't regret seeing 
it, which unfortunately is not the case for most advertising. So, if there's 
sort of something interesting and artistic, or it's like you 

 
it's entertaining, 
it's like 

 
wouldn't waste
 
people's time if they saw it.
 
And also, I think we need to have a more affordable high
-
volume car before 
that makes sense, like the Model 3, so that it's more accessible. So, if we do 
mass media, then it's more likely that somebody could buy the car. And 
that's kind of when it would be something we'd consider.

Jonathan McNeill

Yeah, I think, Phi
l, it's a great question. And actually the answer is no, the 
demand is very strong. We're up significantly over 2014 in the same period, 
and for both Model S and Model X. Both the order rate on Model S and the 
conversion rate orders on Model X has been ver
y strong, and we're not 
seeing that impact at this point in time across really all of our markets, both 
domestic and international.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I mean, that said, we don't want to be complacent about demand 
ge
neration. And, as we mentioned, there's a bunch of stores opening in 
markets where we really haven't had a store or any kind of meaningful 
store. I mean, our store in Manhattan, you basically need to be Sherlock 
Holmes to find it. So, unless you hunt us do
wn, you won't find the store.
 
I think we obviously need to change that, and put stores where people are 
likely to encounter them. It's kind of like a fishing boat or something. It's 
like you want to be where the fish are, it's like not in terms of random, 
barren location. So, that's kind of what we're doing. So, we're not 
complacent about demand, and just in case, we see things take a turn for 
the worse, we want to overshoot on demand generation by our stores.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Amir Rozwadowski 
from Barclays Capital. Your line is 
open.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 

 
Barclays Capital Inc.
 
Thank you very much, and good afternoon Elon, Deepak, and Jeff.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Hi.
 
Jeffrey K. Evanson
 
Hi.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 

 
Barclays Capital Inc.
 
Hi. Yes, I was wondering if we could talk a bit about the rampin
g of your 
facility at the moment. It seems as though, based on your release, you do 
expect to now deliver the vehicles in the June timeframe. And I was 
wondering if you could provide us an update in terms of getting the factory 
up and running to the run ra
te at which you expect to be delivering vehicles 
and where you stand today?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I mean the initial ramp of course would be sort of slow, and then will spool 

because we want to 
as we increase the production, we want to stabilize it at 
various plateaus, evaluate the quality if it looks good, then ramp up. And our 
goal is to be at a run rate, an annualized run rate of greater than 20,000 

 

 

dependent on how rapidly we can make costs add to exceptional quality.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 

 
Barclays Capital Inc.
 
Are there any major pieces that need to be done, shipped in or install
ed on, 
I mean, is there any sort of color you can give us as to where you stand 
today versus perhaps your last earnings call.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yeah, we have all of the factory machinery in place, we have the vast 
majority of the tooling in place. There are a f
ew stamping dies (inaudible) 
due to late changes, and those are coming in next month.
 

any bugs with the overall manufacturing system. The factory is sort of like 
big machine with
 

machine, so work effectively at the subsystem level and then in the 
transition for one subsystem to next and then being able to kind of spool it 
up, and go at a greater and greater speed.
 
And we really 
want to be supersensitive to the quality of the product, and 
our aspiration is to deliver costs that have zero defects. So it will take 
sometime to be able to have the whole system move with equal cadence to 
achieve that goal.
 
Amir Rozwadowski

Would you do feel comfortable that you can hit the 20,000 or greater by the 
end of the year?

Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.

Our next question comes from Chris Kovacs from Robert Baird. Your line is 
open.
 
Christopher M. Kovacs 

Robert W. Baird & Co. Equity Capital Markets
 

going to be another record quarter with reservations, you have over 10,000 
now. Can you give us a sense of, what percentage of those you started to 
lock
-
in, you take specs for cars. 
And then can you maybe comment on how 
the new stores have affected your reservation momentum and how you 
expect the momentum to increase or changes that you can allow customers 
to test drive cars in the summer?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

-
in the
 
cars that are as we queue up the parts for 

-

seeing any significant follow
-
up from at least in the beginning from people, 



the remainder of the money and complete their purchase of the vehicle. 

 
George Blankenship
 
Sure.
 
E
lon R. Musk
 
I have George Blankenship here, and George probably would be the best 
person to provide some color and detail regarding these stores.
 
George Blankenship
 
We had very, very good traffic in Q1 as the shareholder letter said, we had 
over 410,000 pe
ople go through the six new design stores that we have. We 
are now getting ready to start opening our new stores for this year. We plan 
to open about ten more new stores 

 
of the new design stores in traffic 
locations similar to those that the six exists t
hen. And the traffic has been 
very positive and has a positive effect on the reservation flow both from 

open at least 10 stores this year of the new design.
 
Christopher M. Kovacs 

Robert W. Baird & Co. Equity Capital Markets
 
Yeah.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well, and I should say with a particular focus in the greater New York area, 
where we think there is a substantial untapped market.
 
George Blankenship
 
So if you combine the additional marketin
g cars that would be there in these 
stores and the customer rights and drives, definitely there would be a 
significantly higher level of marketing effort and presence that the 
customers who see starting in this quarter.
 
Elon R. Musk
 

 
that, I mean the sign
-


 
the 10,000 

And I think so 

 

test drives and in many cases with stores that only have ca
rs part of the 

cars in all the stores.
 
But today since these cars have been reserved for testing, much of the time 
that there has been no Model S in the store, which offsets the s
ales 
challenge. So I think we should see some acceleration of reservations as a 
function of having cars people can actually drive. And, having more stores 
open and an increased word
-
of
-
mouth from people seeing cars actually on 
the road, and eliminate any q
uestion marks it will, that the car is, in the 
mind of consumer, if the cars brings production.
 
Christopher M. Kovacs 

 
Robert W. Baird & Co. Equity Capital 
Markets
 
Okay, thank you guys for that color. And just one follow
-
up, I think there 
was some news th
at came out with Toyota and RAV4 announcing this week 
and they mentioned 2,600 cars in the next three years or so. Can you talk 
about, is there more to that contract contemplated in that number in terms 
of the $100 million deal you guys have with them, bes
ides 2,600 cars, and 

that numbers in future years beyond the next three?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

scaling up the quantity
 
significantly. And I think Toyota wants to wait until 
the space of the RAV4 program gets on the road before potentially signing 

to conclude that the scale up the odds of scalin
g up, I think, are good. I 
mean, I wish, I could characterize with any greater sense to you than that, 
but I think the reaction to the next RAV4 is going to quite positive.
 

clear i
n the announcement earlier this week it got 60% more range than 
Leaf in highway, city, or any scenario really. So it should be quite a 
compelling vehicle from its capabilities, resemblance and capabilities 
compared to say a Leaf. The prices are bit on the 
high side and, but the

Our next question comes from Patrick Archambault from 
Goldman Sachs. 
Your line is open.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great, thank you very much. I guess two questions from my end. Can you 
tell, obviously you have a pretty big events and well anticipated event in 
front of you. Can you tell us a
 
little bit about what your strategy is to get 
some cars in the hands of the press clearly word
-
of
-
mouth, as you say, is 

reviewed, and hopefully helping the reservation numbers. So how ar
e you 
thinking about that in terms of your marketing strategy over the coming 
month or two?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

September. But that the more, sort of exhausted reviews, I think, we want 
to w
ait until the car is as close to perfect as possible before we do that, so 
certainly past to start of production. If we give a car that may be have some 
bugs in it, and a journalist is free to write whatever they write, then they 
would presumably write abo

that, if those expected to be cleared up within four, five weeks. So I think, 

 
Patrick K. Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Certainly, 

side. It sounds like with some of the tooling, coming in late and, I guess 


manufactured with pre
-

quality, but impacts the cost. Can you tell us a little bit about how you 
expect your material costs to trend as you ramp up and when you think they 
can sort of c
ome down, once you have the volume behind you to that, to 
help you hit that 25% gross margin target.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sure, I mean as we have said the 25% target is when we achieved our 
annualized 20,000 units production since there is labor and overhead 
compo
nent as well to it. So that would be some time late this year and on a 

point primarily in Q2 as you said it could be a variety of reasons why initial 
pricing from suppliers co
uld be low.
 

Just a mere fact that they have low volumes in some cases and result in 

most of Q2 expenses
 

also provided the guidance of our increased R&D expense in Q2.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yeah, to be clear, we remain impacted arguably at this point, increasingly 
confident of achieving 25% gross margin for 2013.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay, terrific very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Thinkequity. Your line is 
open.
 
Colin W. Rusch 

 
ThinkEquity LLC
 
Thanks so much. Can you talk about the cycle time 
right now in terms of car 
production and how many more iterations of the manufacturing process you 
expect to go through before you start selling cars? I should say that more or 
less than specific?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

e reproducing cars at a very 
still base at this point perhaps you can clarify that?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well, you mean production?
 
Colin W. Rusch 

 
ThinkEquity LLC
 

through there assumi
ng now, I mean is it taking two weeks or is it taking a 
four month. And how many iterations on those process refinements, do you 
think you go through before you really like them in?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

 
or five weeks and 
even have to restart production, I think there is going to be room for 


 

down to very sort of small refinements at this point. 
I mean these are kind of nuance issues of fit and finish, and rattle, squeak, 

major stuff. But I want to be really attentive t



reasonable level.
 
Colin W. Rusch 

 
ThinkEquity LLC
 
Great. And can you talk a 
little bit about the cost structures of the battery 
packs, how much do you think you can improve on a pad performance and 
sort of further controls
 
as opposed to improvements on the battery sales, 

ment?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

wanted to, right now, we could build the pack directly build the pack with 

people w

that space for cargo capacity or other things. The bigger focus overtime will 
be improving the cost per kilowatt hour battery pack. And improving both 
the non
-
sale cost and the sale cost, 

are, in terms of achieving the 25% gross margin next year.
 


-
sale pack cost decrease. Historically, 



like things will continue to improve at around that rate in the future.
 
Colin W. Rusch 

 
ThinkEquity LLC
 
All right. Thank you so much.

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Your line is

reservations
 

that focused the attention on the S? But will you continue to publish the 
balance sheet item of reservation payment and if you do will that balance, 
still include Model X reservation payments
 

 
Elon R. Musk
 
Adam, yes, it will, so we have to report that on our balance sheet, so, yeah.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay, all right.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I think yes, obviously, if we show Model S reservations, sho
w the total 


focus is very much on the S.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Understood, but it may raise some
 
questions like the next one, which is if 
you look at the ratio of the cumulative reservation balance over the 
reservation number to get like a ratio, that ratio did decline kind of 
materially from 4Q from the end of December to the end of March, about 
11,
500, about 10,500 on a implying incremental reservation amount, on 
incremental reservation number decline a bit sharper than that.
 
Is there anything to read into that, is that because the Model X reservation 
amounts are just a much lower per unit, or you s
eeing like the incremental 
now at the first that your VIPs and super high network folks that maybe 
were a higher up on the reservation list and getting the performance 
packages, is that reflecting kind of just more of the mass market buyer now, 
if you coul
d call that for the Model S incremental reservation?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

we received more general reservations not signature reservations. As you 
may recall, we basically, completed or sol
d out all of our signature series 
cars in early January and the cause of the reservation amount for signature 
series cars is $40,000 versus $5000 for general production. So clearly, in 

in and 
that resulted in that higher average reservations amount.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great, next question is on your Model S delivery target moving it up into 

million of the group level, that would imply, I mean, there is a very small 


roughly zero deliveries in the se
cond quarter right now. So, I mean are we 
talking about a handful, kind of 10, 20, 30 that order of magnitude, it 

to $30,000 million revenue mark?
 
Elon R. Musk
 


100s.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
So sort of in the 10.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay, just want to confirm that, thanks, Elon. And then finally, 
given the pull 
forward of the good timeframe of the launch timing, a very positive 
reception of Model X. Your ability to kind of show and accelerate perhaps key 
developments for the Gen 3 a few years out, have you given any further 
thoughts potentially, us

Good afternoon, gentlemen, I guess I just want to follow

up on the 
reservation question, just a little differe
ntly, talk about some of the stores 
and some of the sales people and talk about maybe multiple orders, some 
individuals, and maybe some are actually exceeded multiple orders, and 
maybe that affected positive or negatives in terms of you are positioning the
 
car, and then also maybe some people have been rumored to be potentially 
reselling the car, or flipping the car and whether that might has a minor 
impact or not at all, could you address that point first?

Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow
-
up on Model S 
reservation question, you're talking to some of the stores, we heard certain 
comments that maybe certain individuals had ordered multiple, or put dow
n 
multiple reservations in the chances potentially, getting the cars, but all 
concerned if you heard similar things from some of your, some feedback 
from some of your sales people?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
There has been a few mentions of that, the quantity is so mini
mal that it is 
not an issue, there has been a couple issues, they did a couple inputs on our 
web form as well, on the subject, but it is so few and far between that it is 
not an issue.
 
Carter W. Driscoll

Okay. And then just moving ov
er quickly just a question on the Daimler 
agreement, in your prepared remarks you alluded to that potentially 
outpacing all the other development contracts that had before. Has the 
automobile move from the prototype into early stage production, maybe you

Carter W. Driscoll

Elon R. Musk
 
So with respect to Daimler, I know and my apologies for any misinterpreting 
context there. We certainly delivered many electric smart battery packs and 
charges and 
Mercedes A Class, but we have not yet eliminating for the new 
program beyond the initial prototype level.
 
Carter W. Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Therefore on the prepared comments about it, potentially, exceeding the 
other development contracts, is that
 
based on their market division globally, 



 
other development 
contracts if the vehicle is not out of prototype stage?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well, I mean the nature of the agreement is in excess of everything 

gearing up to do with Daiml
er.
 
Carter W. Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Okay. It is just the last, not to push it too hard, but is that, do you expect 
something in the back half of this year, or is it really just all the focus on the 
Model S today?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Our primary focus re
ally is on the Model S, but we still expect to make 
material progress on the new electric Mercedes

Benz later this year. But 
production deliveries in terms of our customers would see is essentially on 
the early 2014 timeframe.

the disclosure of what the mileage was going to be and presumably when 
this goes on sale and the initial deliveries

watt

there is a little room for impr
ovement there. But the current sort of official

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hey, good afternoon. You guys mentioned that there were still some 
stamping dies to be delivered in next month. Are you comfortable with all 
your suppliers in terms of them being able to supply production parts in time 
for the launch?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

 
Dan V. Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank Securit

Okay, got it. And then in terms of the Tesla stores and service centers, can 
you give us an update on how many you feel like you need to support global 
sales of the Model S and the Model X? And clearly, by owning your own 
stores, you guys are cap

franchise dealers but do you have an estimate for what percentage of sales 
kind of the Tesla stores and service center costs will represent as a 
percentage of your revenue, over time?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
So, 
Dan, to answer your earlier question, we expect to have close to 30 
stores by end of this year and as we look at next year and growth of Model X 

think globally that gives us enough cap
acity and throughput in these stores 

far.
 
And we certainly have a sense of our percentage of revenue for these stores. 

necessarily split that out, but I

first few years at least. I mean right now demand outstrips supply, so we 

 
Dan V. Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. T
hanks very much for that and can you give us an update on when 
you expect to begin sales in Europe of the model S and if there is 

 
I am not 
sure if you have announced pricing for the European vehicle but when would 

 
Elon R. 
Musk
 



exchange rate var
iations and logistics costs of bringing things to Europe and 
so there is some import duties and what not., but it will be otherwise quite 
similar to our U.S. pricing.
 
Dan V. Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Got you, there are certain countries in Eu
rope that the tax regimes are very 

 
Elon R. Musk
 
True
 
Dan V. Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Is there any opportunity to kind of take advantage of that a bit by selling the 
car higher or do you think that the pricing will be kind 
of consistent across 
Europe?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

we are sort of really taking advantage of them to lower tax rate and I think 
that will be very bad. But we are going to have really gre
at sales in a lot of 
those countries. I mean we are huge in Norway. There had been a [buzz] in 
Norway at some point, but we actually have just phenomenal customer base 
in Norway and in places like Switzerland and
 
George Blankenship
 
Netherlands
 
Elon R. Musk
 
The Netherlands
 
George Blankenship
 
Denmark
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Denmark, yeah.
 
George Blankenship
 
The Scandinavian countries all really selling on the incentives and the 
customers have responded very positively both for Roadster and for Model X
 
Elon R. Musk
 
And t
hen things like I think London is going to be a very strong market as 

fee, if you have an electric car and the cities are taking a lot of steps to 
install access to electricity for e
lectric vehicles for charging. From a pricing 

kind of push to get a larger premium in Europe. I think that would be to 
send the wrong message to customers. Yeah that will be unfair.

Hi, guys, thanks for taking my call. May be

works.
 
Ben Sc
human 

 
Pacific Crest Securities LLC
 
All right, great thanks. And then I guess with the Toyota announcement 
given the size of the production contract, we get to about 38,000 Tesla 

Mer
cedes powertrain costs can be sort of low enough on higher volumes to 
fit a higher volume vehicle. Can you sort of walk through the steps there. 
Did it all just appear to economy to scale or is there are some additional cost 
reductions that you can point t
o.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

approximations that you just said did of $100 million deal as the volumes 


mprecise and not very useful. There are many elements to our 
transaction with Toyota, in addition to volume. We have partnership with 
them on ongoing training and support and service and warranty and there 
are few other things.
 
So the analysis of cost that
 
you mentioned is not that straightforward on a 
per unit basis. And furthermore for confidentiality reasons, as you can 

underlying cost to us. So, I want to just clarify that and al
so keep in mind 
that the volumes we are talking here on the Toyota program are far lower 
and there is an inherent design in efficiency when you are trying to develop 
a powertrain and make it fit in an internal combustion engine vehicle, it 
doesn't give us 
those cost savings that we get inherently from the Model S 
platform. When we look at the higher volumes for the Daimler program, the 
huge economies of scale and other design factors that help us out.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yeah, I mean just to be clear, the economie
s of scale is the single biggest 
driver of cost reduction, I think first it's an approximation, if you scale up 
production by a factor of 10, your costs would generate drop by half.
 

cost savings is coming from. And then there will also be continued design 
improvements as we figure out how to achieve the same end goal in a 
smarter way. Those are the two drivers of mass market, a technology gains 
mass market which is continued iteration
 
on the design and economies of

drivetrains. In your letter, you allude to tremendous volumes. Can these 
volumes be large enough to change the cost struct
ure of the S drivetrains 
and was a contract of this magnitude factored into your 25% margin guide?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

25% gross margin model, we are talking about the Model S, just by 
itself, so 

some commonality to achieve those economies of scale. And there will be 
some amount of commonality, so I guess it would probably just some help 
to the Model S costs to a
dd the Daimler volume in there. It's not directly 
additive, but I think it's at least partially added it to the economies of scale.

There has been a lot of chatter in the media about the Tesla battery pack 
showing up
 
in solar projects and do you think that solar could be a driver of

some interesting potential in that 
direction may be in partnership with the 
certain solar company.

When investors are thinking about what it takes for EVs to really penetrate 
the market, we always come back to the charging infrastructure build out

do doing to accelerate the build out and what business models do you see 
emerging?

t one more question. You talk 
about Norway, but you missed the big, perhaps the biggest markets for you 
which is China. What kind of interest are you getting from China either for 
store or for a drive chain?

We certainly see China as very impo

sales in China towards the end of next year, but there is a lot of variables in 
there with regard to approvals from the Chinese authorities went up today. 
Our aspiration would be to begin sales that are in the latter 
half of next year.

Our next question comes from Andrea James from Dougherty & Company. 
Your line is open.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company LLC
 
Hi, thanks for taking my 
questions. Trying to gauge the opportunity in the 
Daimler partnership, if we look at all the powertrain agreements signed in 
Tesla history is about $140 million in agreements is that about right? Are 

der of magnitude 
greater than that or just simply greater?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

statements, Andrea there is a little bit more to it, as well as our existing 
Toyota agreement, which is not in our 
financial system and will happen over 
the next few years. So the number is north of that roughly in the $280 so 
million range.
 
In terms of the Daimler contract, its north of that, how much, I think 
probably best to just wait until we mature or get to that 
level and talk 
beyond, but we just wanted to still give you some sense of scale by 
providing that guidance.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company LLC
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yeah, there is certainly, I mean there is a possibility for it to lead to 
somet

reach one level after another. So the question is proving ourselves that at 

to keep doing that in order to pro
gress to essentially the next level.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company LLC
 
Okay. And then R&D in Q3, do you look at that as roughly about half of Q2, 
because some of that shifts up into COGS?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
A lot well shift into COGS, I think
 
half is
 
probab
ly a bit on the high side, in 
terms of have reduction, I mean so it all depends on
 
and there is some 
accounting implications here
 
that we need to sort out
 
is to what
 
costs can 
get trend into COGS
 
and what time
 
versus in R&D.
 

guidan
ce as we 

 
when we do the Q2 call
 
and go into
 
Q3 specifically.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company LLC
 
Okay. And then just raising your lower end of your guidance by the $10 
million there on the earlier deliveries, can you just go over what exactly is in 
th
e guidance range again and sort of what about the early delivery helps you 
to feel more confident on the lower end?

range.

Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co. LLC
 
Thanks and good afternoon. On the last call, you menti
oned that you were 
thinking about a mainstream offering for Gen 3 instead of an updated 
Roadster. Do you have any update on your thought process there, like what 
types of market times you are looking for?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

 
point, because our intention is focused 
on the Model S and on our key powertrain partners, Toyota and Daimler. So, 
I mean, late 2015 would be the earliest.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co. LLC
 
Okay.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
2016 is probably most likely, but something like
 
that.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co. LLC
 
Got it. Okay. And also on the RAV4 electric, are you providing multiple 
versions of a battery pack as [true as it stayed] a 100
-

highlighted in the shareholders letter that you are providing a ran
ge of 170 
miles.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I think there was unfortunately the way that the information was 
communicated was a little confusing because there is actually only this one 
battery pack. And the range is actually, if you were comparing today to what 
the Leaf
 
100
-
mile range is, which is the city driving that compares to the 
170
-
mile number for the RAV4 or sort of 165 miles to 170 miles. If you look 
at the Leaf, say five cycle test that range is in around the 70
-
mile to 75
-
mile 
number I believe, grant maybe 71
-
mile or something, 73
-
mile, very difficult. 
Okay, I think it remains positive at 73
-
mile. So when comparing to the five 
cycle range, the RAV4 range is around 105 miles. So in any given range 
scenario, the RAV4 is about 60% more range than a Leaf.

five cycle range, but which is not apples

mile from Toyota and your

mile delta [unless] 

70
-
mile increment on the city side.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Sorry. Could you repea
t the question?
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co. LLC
 
Toyota had stated 100 miles and you are at 170 miles for the RAV4 and 
there is 70
-
mile delta there, and I guess, or maybe Toyota was mentioning 

 
Elon R. Musk
 

 
Michael Lew

Okay.
 
Elon R. Musk
 


 
high as 120 
miles.
 
Michael Lew

And if you were to compare that to the Leaf, you would compare it to the 
Leafs five cycle range which is 73

mile.

Right. Okay. I get that.
 
Elon R. M
usk
 
Yeah.
 
Michael Lew

Okay. And then, one more.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
What happened in the media was people were looking at the Leafs city range 
of 100
-

not comparable numbers. 

compare it to the sort of 100
-
mile, almost 170
-
mile range for the RAV4.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham & Co. LLC
 
Okay. I agree. And also one last question. Earlier you mentioned a high 
conversion rate for the model S sign ups to reservation. Have you seen any 

wait list for the S may just ch
oose to switch over if they get early on the 
[lane] the model X a little bit earlier?

Well, the model X deliveries will be really, I mean, if you put out a deposit 

months, t

2014, if you put down a deposit for the model X, whereas you get a car in 


 
see how deposits track, but I think it 
will remain true that you will be able to get a model S a lot sooner than a 
Model X for quite some time.

Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a question. From the shareholder letter, 
you say [quote] selected cars are independently purchased and crash tested

and if so, when?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yeah,
 



they are in the queue.
 
Ben 
Z. Rose 

 
Battle Road Research Ltd.
 

say, August or September?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

test the car it will be a 
surprise to our safety rating level. In fact, I think the 
model S, in my opinion, will be the safest car on the road and we have 


 
a big engine block 

be the lowest of any events and our rear crash performance is definitely 
going to be better than any stance because we are protecting for the third 
row occup
ants.
 
In fact, for the rear impact, the car is deigned to not just take a highway 
speed impacting the rear, but be able to take a highway speed impact on 
half the car, which I think is an important threshold for safety for the third 
row seats. And has very
 
good roll over protection. I really think this is going 
to be the safest car on the road.

John Lovallo

Merrill Lynch
 
A few questions for you here. Starting with developmental services revenue, 
was that $5 million in the quarter all Daimler revenue?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah, it is all 

 
John Lovallo

Merrill Lynch
 
And would you say that that $5 million would be a good run rate over the 
next six quarters?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

based
 
on delivery of certain milestones, and there are different revenues 

million and it will be spread over the next six quarters roughly.
 
John Lovallo 
-
 
Merrill Lynch
 
In terms of m
odel S deliveries in the quarter, did you guys disclose how 
many were actually delivered?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We delivered in the quarter 10 model S. We produced a few more, and our 
focus was primarily providing those for our marketing activities, so that we 
coul
d have more ride and drive events, the Get Amped tour that we kicked 
off. So we really wanted to make sure we had a lot going on for our test 
drives.
 
Elon Musk
 

it, somebody probabl

so far. And the production is ramping quite well actually, so it actually steps 

quite a dramatic increase in the productio
n rate in the coming months.
 
John Lovallo

Merrill Lynch
 
In terms of the power train units for Toyota, how many units were actually 
produced this quarter?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

battery packs 


continue to see some growth there.
 
John Lovallo

Merrill Lynch
 
How many roadster vehicles actually remain to be sold t
hroughout the 
remainder of the year?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We have about 130

140 vehicles left to sell, and we expect to have those 
sold out by the end of the year.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Dan Galves from Deutsche Bank
 
Dan Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
In te
rms of the ramp 
-
 
and congratulations on launching the vehicle on time 

-
 
wondering if you could talk about 
what are the key challenges to come in terms of making this exponential 
jump in production rate at some point
 

last minute tweaks in the vehicle, or supplier issues, or the process at 
Fremont. If you could just kind of take us through what the challenges are 
ahead in that.
 
Elon Musk
 

is actually normal in the auto industry 
for there to be an exponential growth in production. So this is not unusual. 
Ours is maybe going over a slightly longer potential than is normally the 

mething 
like 97
-

other vehicle. And you can only make cars as fast as your slowest 
component. And we want to make very sure that every car that comes off 
the line is as close to perfect as pos

every car whenever I can.
 
I think it makes sense to take that approach and ensure that when 
customers receive a car it is as close to flawless as possible, and only grow 

 
to maintain an exceptional 
quality standard rather than to sort of rush into things and then have a great 
deal of customer unhappiness.
 
And when we looked at our cash flow forecasts, whether we did a bunch 
more deliveries in the third quarter or basically
 
if we moved several hundred 

cash low point. And we are optimizing for our cash low point, from a cash 
flow standpoint. And then on the other side, making sure that our customers 
ar
e ecstatic when they get their cars.
 
And so I actually changed the production ramp to slow it down at the 


ertainly 
what I would wish somebody did if I was a shareholder in the company, and 
I am. [laughter]
 
Dan Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
And that makes sense. And just to follow up on your comments on the cash 
flow, it looks like liquidity went down by $120 million 
approximately in the 
quarter. You have $265 million of liquidity available. It seems like the cash 
low point 
-
 


higher
 

any way to kind of gauge whether the cash burn will slow in the third 
quarter and if you have a targeted year end level that you could provide to 
us, that would be helpful.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Dan, I think if this is a managed slowdown, then you can manage cash, and 

units. The worst thing you can do is plan for 1,000 and then deliver 500. 

ash burn. So this is a planned approach, 

letter, our expectation based on our plans is that we will achieve pretty close 
to free cash flow breakeven in Q4. And in Q3, we will see a b
urn roughly 
along the same lines as Q2, maybe slightly higher. But considering all of 
that, and given our cash resources, we feel pretty comfortable that we have 
sufficient liquidity to get to profitability next year.
 
Elon Musk
 
If you move several hundred 
cars from one quarter to the next, it actually 


couple thousand cars a month. So why try to push a product 
on customers 

 
Dan Galves 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
It seems like, different than most auto makers, you recognize revenue when 

ipped off the factory 


more than that? Is that true? And then where do you expect inventory to be 
once you get to close to your targeted run rate of 5,000 a quarter?
 
Elon Musk
 

tricky to 
-
 
essentially, if you imagine the production ramp is this quite sharp 
S curve, and as y
ou pick an arbitrary point on a steep portion of that S 

predict exactly where things will be on that steep portion of the S curve.
 

 
to the flat portion, but at the 



to present 

the effect of the market cap of the company if one is doing the analysis 
correctly.
 

othe

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And Dan, to your specific question, although we recognize the revenue when 
the customer gets the car, the gap is not much. At least in the beginning. A 
lot of our customers are in California. Del
iveries happen immediately. And 


 
Elon Musk
 
And one thing I wanted to reemphasize, if people recall, one of the things 


20,000 units, and that our gross margin will exceed 25%. And I also said 

that I said I was highly confident that we w
ould do. There are other things 
that are sort of nice

to
-



 
exceed 20,000 units next year and exceed 25% gross margin. And those are 
the things that I think you should really hold me and Tesla to.

Your next question comes from Ben Schuman from Pacific Crest Securities.
 
Ben Schuman

Elon, you talked about changing the ramp a little bit. Can you specifically 
address what is driving that in terms of the quality c
ontrol factors that 

 
Elon Musk
 


hundred little 
knick

standards. There were little tiny pits in the plating that were just 
unacceptable to us. So we had to switch that to a differe
nt plating supplier. 
Things like the banana leaf interior trim, when I was shown a sample of that, 
it looked good, but when I saw it on the car, it did not look good, so I 
canned it.
 

unfortun
ately that was not clear until we saw it in a car, which was late in 

-
minute maneuvering. But decisions are made absolutely with respect to 
ensuring that the product is the best possible
 

aiming at. Great companies are just built around great products or services, 
and so we have to be super
-
focused on ensuring that we have a product that 
is not slightly better, but substantially better. And I think we have that

Ben Schuman 

 
Pacific Crest Securities
 
Can you address how cancellations are trending now that more and more of 
those finalize your order emails are going out?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

ing that cancellations as a percentage of our 
reservations is holding fairly steady the last few months. So clearly 

raises any red flags in our minds.
 
Elon Musk
 
Quite frankly, the th




he cancellations that are 
a concern. We do not have a demand problem. We obviously do not have a 
demand problem.
 
One of the biggest reasons people do not put down a reservation payment 
for a Model S is because you have to wait a year almost, or 10

11 month
s. 
And if you need a car, you need a car. So we actually need to focus our 
energies heavily on the production ramp and maintaining quality, and 

generation. George is doing such an awesome
 

worry about that.
 
Ben Schuman 

 
Pacific Crest Securities
 

EVs, things like that, but nothing really close to production that compares to 
the Model S in terms 
of performance characteristics, things like that. Who do 
you think from a competitive standpoint is closest to Tesla, especially on the 
power train side of things, and how far behind are they?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, the next best power trains are the ones that we
 
provide to our 

obviously has some range issues and is not sort of a fun car to drive. I 
actually think that Nissan should double down on their electric vehicle 
investment and just need 

be.
 
But the way to think of the Model S is really not from the standpoint of how 


 
the best car. When you 

handling, performance, the user interface and the functionality and the 
technology in the car, fit and finish. All those things I mentioned, against 
which 

characteristics and integrating them into a Gestalt and saying does this, as 
an integrated system, work? Because sometimes you have a mixture of

The next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 


over 40 a week in Q3. And then to ramp to an average of 375 a week in Q4 
to kind of make the 5,000 full year number. So I totally take on board your 


 
But in order to make sense of this, I think, that vertical portion of the S 
curv
e would have to happen not only pretty quickly but really very early in 

way over 375 a week, which would be implying, I guess 
-
 
maybe this is what 

-
 

 
doing way over a full
-
year clip of 20,000 a 
year. So is there any other way you can kind of give us an idea 
-
 
and if you 

-
 
what your exit rate might be in the third quarter, or 
your entry rate in the fourth? Or am I right to be thinkin
g that in order to do 
your 5,000, that geometric switch has to be pretty damn early in Q4?
 
Elon Musk
 

production rate than 20,000 a year at the end of the year.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanle
y
 
Would that, then, level off? Is that something that would be sustained in like 
a horizontal portion of that curve?
 
Elon Musk
 
That depends on how demand is looking. If demand is looking good, why 
level off?
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
I agree 100%. So 
that is part of the implication, is that it makes the 20,000 
next year 
-
 

implying.
 
Elon Musk
 

 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 

nderstood. And then my last question is 
given the enormous interest in the Model S, and also the very strong interest 
in the Model X, and what looks like the opportunity to launch the Gen III 
-
 
at 
least according to some comments Franz made 
-
 
maybe as earl
y as 2015, 
earlier than many expected, this might accelerate some of your capital 
needs to give these products their full resources. So you throw in some 
uncertain economic conditions and can you see the rationale for potentially 
raising a bit more equity 
capital as sort of an insurance policy to make sure 


 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Actually, I think that there is arguably some merit to
 
raising 
incremental funding just to protect against an unforeseen event. I do want 
to emphasize that our cash flow projections require no funding raise at all. If 
we do not raise any funding, we can reach cash flow positive with decent 



debating internally, and something that we may do. But I do want to 

 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 

opportunistic, to kind of fuel even greater growth opportunity. Is that how 

 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, exactly. And in order for us to not raise any funding, we would 

to spend at the optimal rate.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Would you say that it would be more the early feedback and opportunity on 
the Model X that would potentially drive that op
portunity? Or is it the timing 
and opportunity on the Gen III? Or is it a bit of both, or all of the above?
 
Elon Musk
 


mall amount of 
money, it would be probably half of it for cushion value and then half of it for

on comes from Carter Driscoll from Capstone Investments.

pace in 
the fourth quarter? How do you expect to communicate with the

progress, you will get a sense
 
of it.
 
Elon Musk
 
There will be cars on the road. That will be a huge clue. [laughter]
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

progressing.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think actually people could track it by figuring out what 
serial number car 
has just been delivered. And there you go.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Can you talk about your fast charging initiative and any developments 
there?
 
Elon Musk
 

looking like 

construction and getting all the permits and whatnot for the [super] 

cooler than anyone realizes. I 


there. Almost no one knows the full story. There will be some cool things 
there.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Could you talk 


people fully understand the warranty side for battery versus the vehicle 
itself. Could you just remind everyone what the b
attery and the vehicle 
warranty contains right now?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. For the battery warranty, it essentially merges language that Nissan 
was using, and I think maybe the Volt is also using similar language. Which 
is to say that the battery is warrantied fo
r eight years, and the amount of 
miles you can really put on it. Actually, depending on which version 
-
 

unlimited for the 300
-
mile range version. Unless you torture yourself, you 

-
mile
 

100,000 miles in eight years.
 

vary depending on what sort environment the pack is experiencing and
 
what 
sort of driver the person has been, in much the same way as an engine, 
after eight years, is going to depend on whether someone was driving it 
hard or not, and what sort of environment it saw. It will still be a very usable 


somewhere around double the warranty level.
 
People will probably want to replace it sooner than that, but these really last 
for a long time. Even our first generation pack on the Roadster, one 
customer in Europe
 

someone who drives the car slowly. In fact, he passed the 200,000 km mark 
in a race.

Wells. An



comparable vehicles to be able to set
 
what the residual value is going to be, 

sticking point, as you suddenly saw people wanting to lease the vehicle, 

-
18 mon
ths 
at the minimum.
 
Elon Musk
 

next year at the soonest. We could just be all sales. But we have had many 
discussions about residual value. The thing that supports residual value is 
j
ust to make sure that the depreciation of the battery pack essentially 
matches that of the rest of the car. And if you had a gasoline car, after 10 

-

down to almost nothing.
 
Carter
 
Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Do you expect that to be comparable? Or do you expect residual value to be 
higher?
 
Elon Musk
 
I actually think it will be higher. Because the other thing is once you put a 
new pack into the car, it will actually be better th
an new from a range 
standpoint.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Because you continue to recognize the savings versus fueling your car with 
gas for the next 10 years, or whatever. So you get huge benefits of that.
 
Elon Musk
 

run. I mean, the price of 
gasoline is an upward sloping sine wave.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
I agree with that. Have you guys actually booked any warranty expense in 
anticipation of having to replace any of the batteries?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, with 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 

the entire vehicle, not just to the battery. And just to clarify your other 


retail financing. So residual values or leasing is not really an issue in our 
present offering with Wells Fargo.
 
Elon Musk
 
With Athlon it is.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Athlon is offering their own lease program in Europe for corporate 
clients.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, we did sign our first Model S leasing deal in Europe.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
Have you seen the mix of reservations change as 2012 has unfolded? Are 
you still seeing a similar rate of the signature series versus the 
other range 
models? Or has that stayed fairly consistent? Can you talk about your 
expectations about how that may change over time as well?
 
Elon Musk
 

months now. Not only is the
 
signature series is sold out, we have a long 
waiting list for people to get on [unintelligible], and arguments about what 
place they are on the wait list.
 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
[You were sold out in year two.]
 
Elon Musk
 

 
in the EU on the signature series as well.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
So basically, all the reservations that we are getting now are for general 
production and our customers, when they make a reservation, are basically 

 
locking in which battery 

to lock in their specific order.
 
Elon Musk
 
It is tending to be on the higher end than we expected, I think. That could 


whether people are going to go to cars with fewer options. But certainly the 

 
Carter Driscoll 

 
Capstone Investments
 
I was just trying to get at, yo
u know, given that you have a fairly significant 
amount of your cash in reservation payments, just trying to understand how 
that mix has potentially shifted over time.

Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 

 
Barclays
 
Just touching on the production ramp a bit more, Elon, just want to clarify, 
in the past you had said really that 20,000 production line is really focused 
on sort of one shift operating at one point in time. What type of flexibility do 
you have 
to either add additional personnel, overtime, or anything along 
those lines, in order to meet your production targets?
 
Elon Musk
 



to expand volume. I think in principle we could comfortably have a 


steady pace. Lo


at the end of next year.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think maybe more generally we have flexibility. And the flexibility all
ows us 

I think whatever the targets, it will be what they are, and depending on 
demand, we have that flexibility.

relatively okay position?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 

 
Barclays
 

e certainly seen a number of new stores open 
up in terms of building retail points for you folks as well as building brand 
awareness. How should we think about the trajectory for opex over the 

e plan at this 
point?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think as we indicated in the shareholder letter, certainly R&D expense will 
drop as a lot of those costs move into cost of goods sold. And on the SG&A 
side, as we open stores, and there is an acceleration there, we will
 
see a 
moderate increase in our sales expenses. I would say in the 10
-
15% range 
or so, as we are adding more stores.
 
Elon Musk
 

add to the stores? We just opened the Third Street P
romenade store on 
Santa Monica Boulevard, if people are in the L.A. area and want to get a 
sense for the latest in Tesla store technology.
 
George Blankenship
 
I think our goal with the stores the rest of this year is to try to address some 
new markets. One 

now is that Northeast corridor. And our goal is to open several new stores in 
that corridor in order to hit one of the most densely populated areas of the 
country and try to do it in sort of an acce
lerated way. Because we think 

 

there. I mean, the beauty of our model is that we already know where the 
first 12,000 cars are going. We know 
where customers who are interested in 
us live.
 

there who are already, with very little effort, already reserving our car. Think 
what happens if we actually do put some effort in t


strong demand already in order to leverage that and that word of mouth 
from customer to customer.
 

like kids in a 


stores in and amongst where those people are and they have a place to 
gather and share
 
stories and stuff.
 



Beach.
 
And the t
raffic through the stores has been incredible. I think you probably 

people go through the newly designed stores in North America. I mean, 

inging more people, more 
friends and stuff like that.
 
So the stores are really performing well, and I think by going after the 
Northeast corridor, we will subsequently make a difference by year end. I 
have a goal this year that in the month of December we 
could have a million

Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
I just had, unfortunately, a couple more questions on the ramp. I was 
wondering whether we 
could get just a little bit more color on sort of how

provide updates, because in terms of [zoning] company that does wireless

overnight while the car was in their garage. So that will continue, but we are 

red.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Yeah, I understand that the software piece can be sort of continuous, but it 
sounds like there are still some components that are being made with pre
-
production tooling by some of your suppliers, and I guess the pro
cess of 
getting those finalized and with the right fit and finish is what helps you kind 
of accelerate. Maybe you can just give a little bit of color. Is there kind of a 

improvement to 
be made and a benchmark on that you might be able to sort 
of think about as a guidepost for when that acceleration will take place?
 
Elon Musk
 
There are several thousand parts in the car. Probably 97

98% of them are 

 
to be addressed. But you cannot

an intersection with another piece of bright molding. That intersection 

extremely a


 
Of those sort of couple dozen parts, almost all of them are like interior soft 

gy 
thing. Like our battery pack and power train is in great shape. Chassis is in 
great shape, and body and paint. Obviously we want to keep refining it and 
make sure that the gaps and fits are as close to perfection as physics will 
allow, but obviously the
 
vexing things are a bunch of seemingly trivial 
interior components.

p considerably, and

Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 

Maybe we can talk a little bit about that. Is everything pretty much approved 
now? And are yo

components in house at the right specs? Or is there still some importing of 
components while you kind of fine tune some of these remaining dies?
 
Elon Musk
 


some of the gaps and how well things shut. We really want to set a new 




problem.
 
Maybe this is a flaw in my character, but I tend to be pretty perfectionist 
about these things
, and the goal is that we want the car to be so accurate 

how I want the car to be.

Robert W. Baird
 
Going
 
back to the capital raise question, Bloomberg is already reporting that 
you guys might do a small capital raise. Can you talk about price sensitivity 


ince then in the company? And also around 
timing, a lot of the questions here are focused on the ramp, so would you do 
a capital raise after that ramp was proved out?

priorities of production.
 
Elon Musk
 

huge pro
ponent of leasing, particularly for electric vehicles. As is the case 
with solar, with SolarCity, leasing has proven to be extremely effective as a 

that effective, because if you to
ld someone, hey, this system is going to pay 
you back in five years, and they said, oh, five years, that sounds like a long 


 
And so people seem
 

compounding, a 20% return if it pays back in five years, and with certainty. 
Where do you get something like that? And yet amazingly, SolarCity had 

o go to people that 
understand, people who are sophisticated in finance, and are looking for 


about it, and t
hey can just look at it like their electricity cost went down.
 
Why is that relevant to Tesla? Because the cost of operation on the Model S 
is much less than the cost of operation of any other premium sedan, by far. 

r free. And particularly in places like 

-
10 a gallon in Europe. You can spend a couple hundred 
dollars filling up your gas tank. Or you can spend some negligible amount 
recharging your car.
 
So it really amounts to a huge effective dis
count on the cost of operation of 
the car relative to other premium sedans. But the best way to make that 


f


we should turn our attention to the key thing, which is production, and then 

sing.
 
And we do have data from the Roadster that I think is helpful to leasing 


which Porsche you consi

risk arou
nd timing, around production, deliveries. Maybe if you could just 
expand upon that, how people are ready to accept their cars. And then also, 
is it safe for me to infer from your comments about the quality issues and

between production and delivery. And as we go further out, there is going to 


 
And in terms of deliveries, we are making deliveri

Can you talk about how are reservations converting into the final order for

would you say is the final order number at this point in time? Do you have 
500? 5,000? How should we t

How many people have locked in their options? Is that what you mean?

We have invited the signature reservation holders in the U.S. only to 
configure. And then we went o
ut about 10 days ago, give or take, to our first 



ere to Canada 
signature, then Canada general production. So just to be clear here, we 

it in sequential order based upon when they made their reservation. And as 

about 1,000 fully configured cars that people have finalized 
their options and everything on.

The next question comes from Andrea James from Dougherty & Company.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company
 
Just quickly on the ramp, obviously Elon when you chose to slow production 
in Q3 you had to make a decision 
to ramp even faster to make up for it in 
Q4. What preserved the previous step function? So what went into that 
decision, and why not push some of the 5,000 for this year into next year 
and build in some more contingency time?
 
Elon Musk
 
I never made a hard 
commitment that we were to do 5,000 units this year. 
There was effectively a soft implication that we would do 5,000 units this 
year. The hard one was like the 20,000 next year and 25% gross margin 
and to start deliveries no later than July. Those are the 
three hard ones. The 
others stayed relatively soft. But I still want to aspire to meet something 


that, but w
e want to try to do it for our investors.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company
 



ober or Q1. And I guess just what do you 
make of that commentary? I imagine some people on your team are looking 
at it as well.
 
Elon Musk
 

too much into the message boards. I think som
etimes people can get the 
wrong information and they can sort of panic or assume the worst or 
something like that. George?
 
George Blankenship
 
I monitor them. I watch them on a regular basis. I watch them on a daily 
basis. And I saw one the other day where 
somebody came out and 
specifically said, I have it on good authority that there are 200 founders 

factual inaccuracy. And so I went and I shut it down. Those kind of things 
happen all 
the time. I try to not contribute to the message boards much at 
all, but sometimes things just run awry.
 
Early on, we had gone out with a more firm date, whenever people would 
configure their cars early on, in early April and May configuring their cars. 
An
d our system kicked out a date. There was sort of a projection. And then 
we sort of left it there as a placeholder. And some of those people have 

correcting that.
 
But I watch the boards al


it.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think just sort of judge things by what serial number of cars are being 
delivered and that will give some sense o




not 
based on anything.
 
[unintelligible] say anything about short selling. [laughter]
 
George Blankenship
 
Restrain yourself. [laughter]

ations, 

you say it will be sold out?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I think there will be more orders for cars than we are reasonably able to 
produce at high quality next year.
 
George Blankenship
 
We will
 
not have inventory.
 
Elon Musk
 
We will not have inventory, yes.
 
Andrea James 

 
Dougherty & Company
 


expect to be sold out. Is that kind of what you meant by that?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
George Blankenship
 
I think the way to look at this is that we never plan to have inventory. And 
what will happen is demand 
-
 
we have a plan in place with stores and 
marketing et
c. to get up to a demand rate by month that will always stay 
ahead of production, and we can adjust production depending on where 


ar out. Our goal is 
to have three to four months of active reservations at any given point in 
time ahead of production, whatever the production rate is. So the idea is to 

the prod
uction rate is so that we never have the expense of inventory, we 
never have any of those things. We just have a run rate of three to four 
months of ongoing reservations.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

continues. And we 


 
George Blankenship
 
Right, as we get closer to being able to deliver cars faster, our reservation 
demand wil
l be stronger, because it will be more predictable, and people will 


refunds at that point go almost to nothing becau
se someone will reserve a 
car, and literally go right into the configuration process within the next 30 


p
erfectly.

The next question comes from Michael Lew from Needham.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham
 
With regard to the ongoing nationwide tour, how much incremental demand 
has that generated?
 
George Blankenship
 

d is, I think our end of June 
and July demand has increased for a couple of reasons. One is the news that 


ople 


and coming back and getting their friends involved.
 

the tour, but I want to keep 
a focus on the fact that the tour is really designed for our reservation 

started having lots of test drives, lots available for new customers.
 
So again,
 



-
6,000 test drives of reservation holders, and
 
then we start actually giving 

part of the kick that we will get on new reservations.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, this is actually an important point that George has just made. All these 
tes
t drives, almost all of them are just for existing customers. Essentially, 
we could generate more sales if we wanted to. We could grow the rate 

months before you get the car.
 

add additional orders.
 
George Blankenship
 
And we have an incredibly loyal base. We have an incredibly loyal customer 
base. And if you look at the people who have already received their cars, 
and you look at 


from the cars we have out there from the people who are driving them and 
going to dinner, or going to a show, or whatever, w
ith other people who are 
then calling us and saying, I need to have one like Steve. I want a car like 

having the cars we have out there already. When that starts escalating and 
we st


 
Elon Musk
 

tried harder it would be more than this.
 
George Blankenship
 


to think about on the demand side. We had the Get Amped test drive tour, 


nt tour, we 



end of Q3 and into
 

Model S, and at that point trying in Europe and Asia for the first time.
 
Elon Musk
 


ttle surprising to me that I see articles 


demand issue with Model S.
 
Michael Lew 

 
Needham
 
And so if I understand
 
correctly, there will be a slight pause and then 


 
Elon Musk
 
Absolutely.
 
George Blankenship
 
The Get Amped tour?
 
Elon Musk
 

touched the greater New York area.
 
George Blankenship
 
Yeah, we are opening more stores this year, this fall. In fact, one of our next 
stores will be in the New York metropolitan area, a


Massachusetts area and down into the DC area. We think that market holds 
lots and lots and lots of potential because we already have the number of 
reservations we
 
have there without a lot of presence. When we have 
presence, my retail history tells me that there is lots and lots of untapped 
potential there that we are going to begin tapping starting in September.
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually I think a lot of people on the cal
l are probably from the greater New 

opened in the greater New York area, and the ones that will be opening in 
the next few months.
 
George Blankenship
 
Sure. For those of you in the New
 



Very, very nicely. And you know, we see where all the reserva
tions are 

flow in the West 25th Street store. So having two stores in the market has 
helped.
 

and Short H

open up in Roosevelt Field. So going from one store on West 25th Street to 
having two in Northern Jersey, one in Westchester County, and one in Long 

ew York metropolitan area with 
those particular centers surrounding the city.
 
Elon Musk
 
And our store in Chelsea, we got that lease because it was the only lease we 

technology. I
f you want to see the latest in store technology 
-
 

using that word facetiously; there really is store technology 
-
 
you want to go 
to the Westchester or the stores that are opening up in New Jersey or Long 
Island. That will show you the latest a
nd greatest in the retail experience.
 
But it just gives you some sense. I count the store in Chelsea as like a half 
store. And we had a half store until a few months ago in the entire greater 
New York area. A half store.
 
George Blankenship
 
And like I said,
 

got that additional awareness and a little bit of publicity and media. We now 
have two full stores. Because we took the half store and made it into a full 
store with reservations. And not from a tec
hnology standpoint, but from a 
productivity standpoint.

The next question comes from Jesse Pichel from Jeffries.
 
Jesse Pichel 

 
Jefferies
 
Deepak, for modeling purposes, wha
t is the targeted cash cycle days 
conversion we should be thinking about at full ramp? Can we assume sub
-
20?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 


 
Jesse Pichel 

 
Jefferies
 
If we take days inventory, days receivable, and days payable, and basically 
add them up, how quickly can you turn it into cash.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think the way we look at it is that fundamentally we have zero receivables. 
We deliver t
he car within a few days of production and we get full payment. 
But our supplier payment terms are on average about 45 days. So we tend 
to deliver and receive money before we have to pay to our suppliers. So I 
think from your point of view, more focus is w
orking capital usage, and our 

actually helps us from a cash flow perspective.
 
Elon Musk
 
The asked question is a good one, because if a business needs to raise 
equity or something to buil
d working capital as it grows, the effective return 

around. In our case, it is the other way around. The faster we grow the 
business, the more cash we have available.

Are you breaking out X reservations in the quarter?

attention to next year.
 
Jesse Pichel 

 
Jefferies
 
Do you think some of the reservations for S and X are U.S. delivery from 
European or Asian clients?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Definitely we have reservations. As George 
mentioned, our Model S 
reservations include European signature series, where we are sold out. We 
have reservations from all over the world for both S and X.

re just going to ship it to Europe.
 
Jesse Pichel 

 
Jefferies
 

is really going to increase the reservations that much, or if they are already 
reserving today.
 
Elon Musk
 
Oh yeah, it w
ill increase it massively.
 
George Blankenship
 
Your question is appropriate in that do I think there are five people, ten 
people who have bought U.S. cars that are going to take them to Europe? 

ing more 

be no impact.
 
Jesse Pichel 

 
Jefferies
 
I guess it not quite as exotic as picking up your Mercedes from Stuttgart, but 
I guess you can give them a burger and send them on th
eir way. But you

5/8/15,Tesla,"First question, how many vehicles are coming clean off the line with no 
material rework at this point? And I'm just curious, has any model really 
come pure off the line at all without much rework? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
We do get some cars that are 
required meaningful rework. But generally 
we're trying to maintain extremely standard of qualities. So if we see some 
that's even a minor aesthetic issue, we want to correct that. And now that 
most vehicles require some work to correct minor issues. A lot 
of issues are 
not something that mostly would even notice, but we're trying to get as 
close to perfect as possible.
 
Nonetheless, we are able to get to a production rate, which is annualized at 
10,000 cars a year. And I feel really good about where we are w
ith respect 
to manufacturing the vehicles.
 
Adam Jonas

Morgan Stanley
 
If you think about all the issues that were affecting the early production of 
the vehicle, what are the key ones that you've solved, which ones have yet 
to be solved, and is the list of
 
new problems growing, meaning, are there 
any additional new problems that you're finding or all the issues that you 
know in terms of either quality or supply known and that's a shrinking list 
now?
 
Elon Musk
 
Our biggest issue has been getting all of the pa
rts of the vehicle on time for 
suppliers and at a very high quality. I think we're through those issues. 
There are no supply issues that I'm aware of right now, that prevent us from 
achieving at an annualized production rate of 20,000 vehicles a year, 
basi
cally within next four, five weeks.
 
So it's looking good. That's not to say something couldn't crop up, but it's 
looking quite good. And we're seeing a rapid decline in the number of correct 
issues that needs to be corrected as vehicles come up in the line
. So it's 
getting better very quickly. So right now, I feel very optimistic about with 
the way things are. And I'm not aware of any issues in front of us getting to 
the 20,000 units to our annualized production volume.

Deepak, j
ust a couple of very quick ones for you. On the reservation outlook, 
I know you're targeting a new high
-
water mark in terms of unit reservations 
over 13,200 by yearend. But when we look at the reservation balance on the 
balance sheet, should we assume that
 
that's going to be lower, and if it is 
lower, can you give any kind of lower bound of that, meaning should it be 
going to still be over $100 million end of year?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, I think it definitely will be over $100 million. And you're right, to the 
e
xtent signature reservations come off. We have collected a much higher 
deposit on them compared to general production reservations. So there 
would be some adjustment in our reservations balance to account for that.
 
Adam Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
And then on R
&D, you gave the flat 4Q guidance around $60 million. That is 
a quite a bit higher, I think many people on the call would have expected. 
Are you able to explain kind of why is it running higher and is $60 million a 
quarter a run rate, we should use going i
n the next year?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I think we should be, as the letter has indicated this is still a 19% 
reduction from the prior quarter, and that's primarily as we have pulled out 
all the manufacturing related expenses. Most of our R&D count now is people 
a
t this point, and we are focused on future product development, bunch of 
actions still continue to improve our products. So I think that's fairly 
reasonable rate going forward.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs.
 
Patric
k Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
I guess I just wanted to follow one clarification and then a separate 
question, just on Adam's question. We can affirm that what's left in terms of 
challenges is really sort of fit and finish challenges, kind of that are relat
ed 
to the assembly process rather than the availability of the right amount of 
components. So is that a correct interpretation?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So right now we're able to build cars at the 10,000 year
-
to
-
year 
annualized rate with the parts we need. And as o
f today, I don't know if any 
part that would prevent us from getting to the 20,000 year
-
to
-
year level in 
four or five weeks. So it looks like once a plain sailing, but it looks like, solid 
sailing in that direction. So I think those gross could come up, th
at I'm not 
aware of any obstacles to that as of to getting there right now, touchwood, 
it's looking quite good.
 
And I should say, I mean, overall, I feel Tesla was really kind of past the 
point of high risk. Several months ago, I said I thought that the co
ming 
several months would be really the test for Tesla. And it's the classic phrase 
of, going through the valley of death, and I feel as that we are through that 
valley at this point.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
And then maybe one for Deepak, just 
at a high level can you maybe just 
give us a little bit on the landscape of capital investments. You've clearly 
from an R&D point transition to the X, but then there is also I assume early 
engineering done the Gen III. So how should we think about sort of 
a 
lumpiness of your R&D and capital spending patterns as we kind of look at to 
the next 18 months or so?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think what I would prefer to do is that the next earnings call provide 
formal, a sense of the trends we would have on our R&D expenses f
or 2013. 
But I think broadly speaking the factors that affect R&D would be as you 
said our new product development which includes Model X, Model S. And 
we're going to be working on a right
-
hand
-
drive version, European version, 
there are few other things. A
nd it's our continued improvements in 
manufacturing and design that we will be focused on.
 
So there will be some degree of lumpiness. But nothing there will be as 
significant as we saw in 2012, because all the manufacturing expenses are 
no longer in 
R&D. And we've continued to stay that way.
 
Elon Musk
 
Just to clarify what is interpreted by Deepak's statement is that the left
-
hand
-
drive European version has very little work left to do to it. In fact, we 
have two EU approved vehicles in EU right now dur
ing the initial market. We 
just started marketing in EU. So the real incremental R&D is with respect to, 
as Deepak mentioned the right
-
hand
-
drive version of the EU version, which 
had applied to Japan and Hong Kong and few other places.
 
And then there are a
 
few other variants of the Model S that we will kind of 
put next year that I think is going to be pretty exciting. In addition to, of 
course, we were getting into the Model X and starting the initial design work 
of the third generation S market vehicle.

Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays
 
Touching on the sort of the new reservation activity, you mentioned sort of 
new reservations in the quarter were roughly around 2,900 with net 
reservations around 1,
700 and cancellations have crept up. I was wondering, 
if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of what's driving sort of the 
cancellation activity? Do you expect it to diminish at some point and perhaps 
also do you expect to transition to much m
ore of a real time sort of 
orders/delivery type model versus what we've seen obviously in the early 
stages of the launch of the vehicle with sort of the reservation type model?
 
Elon Musk
 
I'm sure I can answer a part and then I'll turn it to George to add s
ome 
more details. I think that the way things are going with Telsa, it will be a 
while before we transition to any kind of real time meaning like you can just 
go in and buy a car. And given the way to pursue effectively settlements 
right now and expect to 
be at least for a few quarters and continue new 
high
-
water marks and new reservations.
 
I think it could be quite a while before someone can just walk in and buy a 
car. It could be as far as to 2014 before that's even possible. So it's certainly 
correct. If
 
they're assuming the car to put down a reservation, and not to be 
able to impression that they will just be able to at some point buy car and 
just have it in the line. I often encounter this sentiment with people where 
they can just wait and then just be 
able to buy a car and I think it's going to 
a long time before that's the case. George, would you like to add anything to 
that?
 
George Blankenship
 
It's been a lot of time in the story, I think here is what's happening is, our 
increase in reservations is a 
combination of several things. One is we have 
more stores open and as we open more stores, we're getting in front of 
more, and more, and more people everyday. I mean, we've seen 1.8 million 
people through our stores year
-
to
-
date, but the last quarter was a
 
significant 
increase over previous quarters, because of more stores being open and 
we've got five more opening by December 1 of this year, all in high
-
traffic, 
high
-
visibility locations.
 
And as we open up the new stores, more and more people are coming an
d 
say, who is Tesla, and we're getting that increase in awareness in significant 
ways. And I think we're reaping some of the benefit of having been open 
now for about 18 months with these new design stores where we getting a 
lot of traffic.
 
And then I thin
k next is the awards. We're getting some very, very positive 
awards that we're letting people know about. And that's reinforcing that the 
car is quite extraordinary and somebody else is saying, besides us. We got a 
lot of press right after the June 22 star
t, and now we've got more recently 
with Automobile Magazine, Yahoo! Autos, thus making real positive.
 
And then there is one other element that we're experiencing in California, 
specifically where we've delivered a lot of cars is that they're putting cars o
n 
the road now that people are taking other people out to dinner with, they're 
going to movies, they're going to shows with, they're going to their house 
and people are seeing the cars, oh my god, how do I get one of these. And 
so our customer base that ha
d actually received their cars are actually 
selling cars for us, making reservations for us.
 
And so we got, the really big effect going on right now, which is really 
positive. And as far as timelines when people would be able to come in and 
buy a car right
 
away, I don't see that anytime in the near future, in fact 
that's not even the goal. The goal will always be that there is a reservation 
time, so that we can build your cars specifically for you. So I don't see that 
on the horizon at all at this point.
 
El
on Musk
 
I get to know a customer, who's received a car, and told me weirdly, how 
many additional cars they sold to people that they know, in some cases, 
strangers on the street. It really is spreading quite wildly by word of mouth. 
It's worth noting that a
t Telsa store does not spend any money on 
advertising.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays
 
And it does seem like you folks are benefiting from this halo effect as you 
get vehicles on the road, just on the flipside with respect to cancellations. 
However, I mean do 
you expect sort of to reach a threshold, which there's 
less cancellation activity, just given that now you have more stores out 
there, perhaps it's a little bit timeframe, rather is a timeframe to wait for a 
car, perhaps it's compressing a bit as you start
 
to deliver these vehicles? 
Just trying to understand the dynamics for sort of net reservations there?
 
George Blankenship
 
We do a lot of watching of this and I also saw that. And what's happening is 
the refunds that are happening now were very, very expect
ed. We're going 
through people, through the reservations that were made in 2009, 2010, 
lots of changes that's happened at different points in time.
 
And by the time we get into Q1, what will happen is, the waiting time 
between when you make your reservation
 
and when you actually configure 
your car, will go from two
-
and
-
a
-
half to three years, and then down to 
literally a couple of months. So the time will just be minimal. The time will 
be minimal, and therefore there won' be a reason to be canceling. So we se
e 
this becoming a non
-
issue in North America as we get into the beginning of 
next year, I mean the refund count will go down a lot.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays
 
And then, lastly if I may, looking at your guidance for sort of delivery this 
year, it seems the
re's a modest down tick from your prior expectations of 
around 2,700 to 3,250 versus now regarding the release around 2,500 to 
3,000. Is that largely attributed to some of the supply issue that you guys 
had already mention, and should we expect this to be 
sort of, now that it 
seems like those are behind you or is this sort of a fairly achievable target 
from your perspective?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Just to clarify there, Amir, our guidance hasn't changed. The 2,500 to 3,000 
deliveries is for Q4, while the 2,750 to 3,2
50 was the full year guidance, and 
that includes Q3 deliveries.

I wanted to better understand your prepared remarks about the gross 
margin target by the end of the year. So could you give us a sense of, if you 
were to take aw
ay the cost of the ramp up and say cost of additional rework, 
where would the gross margin stand today?
 
Elon Musk
 
That's interesting, hypothetical. Well, I guess I would say assuming that 
we're at the 20,000 unit per year production rate, which we've been 
quite 
at, because the gross margin is really affected by the ramp. And assuming 
that it's too fast
-
forward, five weeks or something like that. And if you take 
out the short
-
term cost issues associated with the ramp, and just the things 
that we sort of have
 
put on hold. If you take non
-
cost down issues that we 
put on hold to ensure that we make around, we would be at the 25% gross 
margin level.

I know you offer
ed decent amount of updates on reservations, is there

they turned it on a monthly basis through 3Q?
 
Deepak Ahuj
a
 
I think we would prefer not to give specific monthly numbers. But I think 
George gave you a good sense earlier, that given our continued store 
openings, the visibility of the car and the recent awards that the car has 
won, certainly seem a good up tick r
ecently.
 
Aaron Chew

For my follow
-
up, wondering if you guys can offer any further insights 
beyond what was mentioned on the website with regard to the lawsuit. I'm 
sure it's a sensitive matter, so there's only so much you guys can say. But 
maybe so
me general thoughts on timing, whether damages are being 
sought, and what implications you guys think maybe to your store strategy, 
if they were to win?
 
Elon Musk
 
We got to be a little bit cautious about commenting on ongoing lawsuits and 
any other perspec
tive, a traditional process. But we feel, we're quite 
optimistic with respect to our legal position. We really feel strong that we're 
in the right, and it's worth noting that thus far no injunctions have been 
issued. So we really feel optimistic that we wi
ll prevail in these cases, and 
that we are strongly on the side of what the law intended to occur. So other 
than that there are no great insights, except to say that we feel really 
optimistic about where we are.

Our next question is from Carter Dr
iscoll of Capstone Investments.
 
Carter Driscoll 
-
 
Capstone Investments
 
First question is, trying to get a little closer to an ASP figure, could you talk 
about what maybe the average option package size or range has been so far 
for the signature series? And
 
how you see that potentially playing out as 
your mix shift changes, so that the similar range is a percentage of the base 
model, your expectations there? And then, I have follow
-
up.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right now we're still working our way through this industry, wh
ich is quite a 
heavy optioned version of the car. We've been surprised by the level of 
interest in the performance version of the car till that takes us a bit by a 
surprise and actually causes us some slight challenges in meeting the 
production ramp for co
mponents that are specific to the performance version 
of the car, I feel which will surprise us by how many people were interested 
in that.
 
And looking ahead, our option mix still looks like it's quite rich actually. So 
it's really looking, I'd say, 
maybe a little better than anticipated, but usually 
that could change. We don't have a crystal ball as to say how things could 
go long
-
term, but it's been better than I expected in terms of the number of 
things, that we were interested in having on the car
. So George or Deepak, 
if you want to add to that.
 
George Blankenship
 
I agree with that. One of the option that has been most favorable, we see if 
that the performance, and the signature version of the car as Elon said was 
highly optioned and there really 
weren't a lot of options on that car, 
specifically because of the signature car, as we moved into the general 
production reservations.
 
Very happy with performance and from the other options, that we weren't 
sure how well they've been received. And they've 
been received very, very 
well. So I agree with Elon that we're slightly ahead of where we thought we 
would be with options.
 
Elon Musk
 
With that said, a lot of customers really ask for more options. So we will try 
to roll out a few more extras that people c
ould buy, that like and maybe a 
few of the people can retroactively add to their car.

Capstone Investments
 
My quick follow
-
up is I think you had talked just a few weeks ago about 
potentially reaching cash flow, breaking it by end of Novem
ber. I think in 
your written commentary, you think it's closer to the end of the year. Could 
you talk about whether that was expediting cost, supplier issues, some net 
reservations changing, could you talk about what changed that date by 
approximately a mo
nth, and you're confident that it will December now?
 
George Blankenship
 
Well, we haven't really changed the date by a month. So I think we actually 
expect that to occur as we previously expected. But the things can shift 
around by a week or two, but not re
ally much more than that. And I think 
actually it will be as expected.
 
Elon Musk

First question is if you think about the Daimler contract and just kind of the 
shift in timing, I mean can you just talk about maybe what were the drivers 
of that shift?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
It was really not something significant. We were sorting out some of the 
technical specification to the milestones. And that was required for us to 
make sure we were doing revenue recognition, correctly. And those issues 
are all pretty much behind us.
 
Elon Musk
 
Essentially the project is proceeding actually at the expected pace
. We're 
just being conservative about the revenue recognition. And we want to make 
sure. We don't run the risk of the restatement, not with respect to the 
Daimler contract. So operationally, it's proceeding as expected, but which is 
being a little bit on t
he conservative side, and otherwise our revenue would 
actually be higher than what we currently stated.
 
George Blankenship
 
That's a very good point that operationally the program is proceeding very 
well and has been.
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually our revenue would be
 
higher if we've been less conservative in the 
recognition of our revenue.

And then if I could just follow
-
up with a maybe a quick kind of housekeeping 
question here. I was under the impression that the interest expense would 
f
lip to closer to $2 million, once production began on the Model S, am I 
incorrect on that or was there's some kind of change?

Our next question is from Elaine Kwei of Jefferies.
 
Elaine Kwei

Jefferies
 
I think most of my questions have been touched on, but just a big picture 
one, what's the eventual vision for the Supercharger network. Is this going 
to be 
expanded to the 60 kilowatt and the 40 kilowatt, and possibly even the 
future mainstream mass
-
market Gen III vehicle or what's the thought there?
 
Elon Musk
 
It would actually apply to the 85 kilowatt version automatically, that's just 
being included. And th
en for, a couple of thousand dollars, you can get the 
Supercharger hardware added to the 60 kilowatt version. We're not currently 
planning or adding it to the 40 kilowatt version, because we see that as, the 
customer buying that is really buying it because
 
they don't really make long 
business trips. So it tends to be a more of a car that you'd want to use for 
travel just within a greater metropolitan area.
 
We do expect to have a Supercharger network to be used by the particularly 
by the Model X, and by our 
third
-
generation vehicle. But we're thinking that 
if you want to have a nominal range, at least on the order of 200 miles of 
range, at 55 miles an hour, for the Supercharger network. And that's basic a 
basic version. But we do expect that the vast majority
 
of cost that we 
produce going forward to have access to the Supercharger network, like said 
apart from the very lowest version of the model which is for those who are 
just almost going to take long distance trip.

w

yourself also dominating that re
-
sell market for any fut
ure Model S or Model 
X or other vehicle?

Yes. There will be a few more Roadsters. These are just ones in terms of 
Europe and Asia. So there's not very many left, so it's not going to be a 
huge number. But in terms of, used Roadsters, yes, we do e
xpect to do a 
decent business in used Roadsters, and doing the same with Model S and 
Model X. And I think that's going to be interesting revenue source for us in 
the future. George, is there anything you'd like add to that?

adsters that are remaining that are new are in Europe and Asia, 
and right

hand

driving is basically done except for a couple of demos. We're 
putting together international program that actually brings back Roadsters. 
And this will translate to Model S, in 
the future Model X.
 
So that we actually manage that process and so we control the value of that 
secondary part of the market. We think that's very important. So we actually 
have a staff that's dedicated to specifically managing used Roadsters now in 
North 
America, based out of California. So we think it's an important part of 
business opportunity for us going forward.

Am I, right understanding the half way to 25% gross margi
n expectation as 
sort of a snapshot exiting Q4? And if so can you give us some color on what 
the overall gross margin could be in Q4?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We want to be sure we are beating our numbers here. So we want to be 
careful. But it should be relatively clo
se. And I think we want to just help 
give the sense that we'd be around the right track, and as Elon said looking 
beyond, we're on track to get to 25%.

And then you hired all the employees you need in terms of manufacturing to 
g
et to the 20,000 unit run rate, and how long is it typically taking you guys 
to get new factory employees around that?
 
Elon Musk
 
We've hired almost all of the people that we need for the 20,000 unit a year 
to ramp. And typically it's 54 on board and traine
d is around two to three 
week process. So I think really things are in place to get to that run rate in 
four or five weeks.

Our next question is from Dan Galves of Deutsche Bank.

Deutsche Bank
 
Just wanted to dig into this comment on t
hat absent cost and efficiencies. 
You're now at production rate capable of generating positive operating cash 
flow. Just trying to keep it simple, your operating expenses excluding stock
-
based comp are running above $350 million annualized right now. If we
 
used 
$25,000 gross margin per unit, you would need to do about $14,000 units 
per year to breakeven on that.
 
I'm just wondering if you can give me any additional color on what's 
involved in that or what I'm missing in that calculation. And then if you 
could 
talk about your cash breakeven point going forward as ASP is likely will 
come down at some point, but the gross margin it looks like will continue to 
improve from current levels, but if you could give us any more color on that 
calculation?
 
Elon Musk
 
Dan, the other elements of the balance sheet items that effect including how 
our inventories and ASPs get managed and our reservation is balance. So 
when we look at that on a combined basis, from an operational perspective, 
we're comfortable with the messa
ge that we have provided in the letter.
 
Dan Galves

Deutsche Bank
 
So that includes some more working balance sheet changes
 
Elon Musk
 
Right.

And could you give us an update on where you stand in terms of 
homologation of the vehic
le in Europe. When you expect that to launch and 
what's the ability of people in Europe to make reservations currently and 
how many have?
 
Elon Musk
 
We've made huge progress on homologation. We designed the Model S from 
the beginning to meet the European an
d American specs. And in fact, specs 
in Japan and Asia, as much as possible. So we believe that some of those 
specs were usually exclusive. And in fact, we have two, Model S us with 
German plates currently driving around that we completed as part of our 
Eu
ropean media launch recently.
 
So we believe that there is very little to get the European spec in 
homologation ready for production. We could start production of those units 
sooner than kind of the March, April timeframe next year. But there is not 
really 
a need to do that, since we can fully install our production with North 
American demand, rather than increase the complication of managing all 
those cars in Europe. And we want to stay focused in North America just for 
a few more months, before we start sh
ip cars over to Europe, and then Asia 
shortly thereafter.
 
Dan Galves

And are people able to make reservations in Europe now.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, absolutely.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
As George can add some more insight there, clearly we've seen an up tick 
wi
th recent activities and so we've just begun the launch of the Model S 
marketing activities in Europe. So overall we have probably around 15%, 
20% of our reservations in Europe.

If I make some assumption that how many people you're calling to lock in, I 
think I calculated that the cancellation rate for lock in's is about 1 and 10, 
and so is that about right? And how does that compare to what you're 
exp
ecting?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think our cancellations rates for people that we reach out to confirm a 
booking is in the 10% to 15% range. It depends on how old some of these 
were. So you're in right ballpark. Fair Andrea? George anything else you 
may want to add.
 
George Blankenship
 
No it's just that the number was completely expected to be where it is, and 
is expected to go down as we get into Q1.
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually, you said that the rate of cancellations for people that have locked 
in, the cancellation for peopl
e that have actually confirmed that their options 
is extremely low. There are very few people that cancel once they've decided 
what their options are going to be. The cancellation seems to occur before 
they've decided, but that's where the 10% to 15% cance
llation occurs.

Dougherty & Company
 
And looking at your September 25 communication on growth reservations 
and then I look at what you're saying today, it looks like you've booked up 
300 new reservations in the last five days of Q3. Is 
that sound all right? And 
I think that's where you want to be and it sounds like you got there already?
 
George Blankenship

I would say it's a bit of rounding there. So it's in the ball park, but there is a 
bit of rounding.

With regard to the Superchargers, has it yet been a factor or do you expect 
it to be an influencing factor in the general reservationists population and 
whether or not they choose, let's say, an 85 kilowatt 
hour model versus a 40 
kilowatt hour vehicle?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I think so. I think there are lot of reasons to take the higher range car, 
assuming the performance elements, it gets little faster, its acceleration is 
very high top speed, that the warranty is 
a little bit better, but I think the 
more you travel long distance with Supercharger, the fact that you'll able to 
travel full free anywhere in America long distance, I think is pretty 
appealing.
 
And you'll probably just open the Superchargers system open 
to the public 
and I really think it's a wonderful experience when you use it. I actually 
drove with my all five of my kids in the Model S with luggage in the front 
trunk. So fully loaded, all the way from LA to San Francisco and it was really 
a great road 
trip.
 
And with no hitches, and when we had stopped for meal, or the restroom by 
the time we came back the, care was ready to go, so I think it's really 
exceeded my expectations actually for what I was hoping it would be and 
how well it would function. So I
 
am really excited about it and I think as 
people use it, it's really going to open their open eyes, as to what an electric 
car could be like, and just not having to go to a gas station, and invest in 
fumes and pay how much money for gas. Tesla's free long
 
distance, powered 
by sunlight, I think is quite a revolution, I think.
 
Michael Lew

Needham
 
Have they also drove incremental demand or increase from OEMs like for 
powertrain agreements, just given its high rate or fast charging capabilities?
 
Elon Musk
 
We
ll, our partners with Mercedes and Skoda, both of them been more 
interested in shorter range vehicles rather than tackling long range problem. 
It was certainly something we would be happy to give access to. We have to 
give an access to it, but I think it n
eeds just a bit of a larger battery pack 
than they're currently specking for car.
 
Michael Lew

Needham
 
Where there new increase since the unveiling of the Superchargers and OEM 
select new platforms in the future? I mean let's put it this way, 10 minutes i
s 
a lot faster than and we hate hours?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, true. Surprisingly there haven't been a lot of increases on that front. 
Maybe it's just taking time to sink in. And I think it's currently in the main 
mind frame that it's more of a greater metropolitan
 
area travel vehicle, in 
the other case the RAV4 and the V Class Mercedes. And I think once they 
see how customers are adopting and using the Supercharger network, their 
interest will peak. I really don't think people realize just how cool it is. It's 
just
 
works. It's one of those things where it's even better than it sounds. It's 
better than the marketing.
 
Michael Lew

One last question, you've highlighted the role of word of mouth, the roll it's 
played in driving reservations. Could you give us 
a sense or gage of what 
percentage or what number of net adds in 3Q where by word of mouth, if 
there's a figure out there? I don't know if you've tracked it that way?
 
Elon Musk
 
It's essentially almost all our word of mouth or media, because it's the 
advert
ising that we do.
 
Michael Lew 
-
 
Needham
 
I guess, I meant store walk
-
ins or shall we walk in to see design centre?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. George, would you probably answer the question.
 
George Blankenship
 
We don't have the exact numbers on which ones were customer references, 
because some of them are multiple customer references, some of them 
come to the stores specifically, because they went to dinner the night before 
with somebody who's received a car and
 
then they come in to the store. 
They get more information and make a reservation.
 
We don't track it specifically by customer. But when we start to look at 
geographic areas where we have the most delivered cars, those areas are 
really starting to escalate 
very quickly in reservations for more cars. So we 
don't have it down to a specific percentage or number. It's just when you 
look at the overall picture, you can see that where we have the most cars 
delivered, reservations are escalating significantly.
 
Mich
ael Lew

Needham
 
So on that note, I guess, you would also apply towards cancellation rates. 
So it's fair to say in the areas where there are fewer vehicles on the road, 
you'll probably experience more cancellations. Is that the way to look at it?
 
George B
lankenship
 
I haven't really tracked it that way. I haven't really backed into it that way. 
So couldn't really quantify that that for you.
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean, that's probably true anecdotally. Just given the delivered amount of 
car is incredibly good. So I've
 
not accounted anyone, who said that they 
tried the car and then didn't like it. It tends to be very opposite.

Robert W. Baird
 
I was wondering, we get a lot of questions about the
 
25% gross margin. 
How much of battery cost reductions are built into it, you mean that target if 
any? And then how do you view any cost reductions on the battery side as 
upside to the gross margin?
 
Elon Musk
 
Just separate out the battery, there is the sal
e of cost and then there is the 
battery balancing system cost. So we really not moving any significant 
production and sale cost into getting through 25% gross margin. There are 
bunch of reductions associated with the pack cost.
 
But we have really good insi
ght into those and anecdotal path to get those 
done in a fairly short period of time, so not really worried about battery pack 
cost at all. In fact, I think just overall we've got a really good handle on 
getting to 25%. I've very high confidence of getting
 
there. My goal is to 
exceed 25%, and not just stop at that point.

Baird
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I think, one of things that investors 
will be focused on is the amount of churn, could you guys just talk about 
where you 
are seeing that churn, and then how much time you think it takes 
for it to level off?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean, I think, you maybe referring to, I think, there was 

 
there had 

is tha

 
Ben Kallo

Baird
 

that you called the store, and they said that I can get my car in a month or 
45 days.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Ben Kall
o 
-
 
Baird
 
So maybe you could tie that into also having the record level of reservations, 
but then having some people opt out of or take their money back, their 
deposit back?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Absolutely. So, I think, there was 
--
 
I think some articles are out
 
there 

now for a car is about five months. However, there are some configurations 
which are available in more like maybe six to eight weeks, which are the 
very high
-
end reservations
.
 
So, but it should be pointed out that like really we are still talking about an 

to close all of our stores right now world
-
wide and not have any product 
specialists or sales pe


 
Ben Kallo 
-
 
Baird
 
And I guess if you could just elaborate on how you are seeing demand pick 
up in other places outside North America, and
 
what we should expect as the 

 
Elon Musk
 


have two cars in 

next few months, and we are going to start marketing heavily in Europe and 
then start doing the same in Asia.
 
We feel very confident of achieving a demand level in excess of 20,000 units 
a year. A

expand to Asia and Europe and actually start marketing there. I have 
George Blankenship here with me. George, do you want to add anything to 
that?
 
George Blankenship
 
Yes. We had a press event 
preview in Europe at the end of October, and it 
was received very, very well. At this point, the interesting thing about 

even have any display cars there yet.
 
We will over the nex

sending display cars over there, but right now, we are still transitioning out 
of Roadster into Model S in the stores without any display cars and still 
having a nice pick up in European reservations.
 
As f

--
 

are opening in China, our first store, later in the spring, and we expect real 
positive results there. And we are just now starting to show Model S in Asia 
in Hong Kong and Japan with st
ores planned for there in the later part of this 
year.
 

at all anywhere outside of North America, yet 25% 
--
 
about 25% of our 
reservations are outside North America.
 
Ben Kallo 
-
 
Ba
ird
 
Right.
 
George Blankenship
 
So 
--
 
and in North America, you probably saw in Q4, in our stores in North 
America, we had 1.6 million people go through the stores just in Q4, so 

 
Christmas, but we expect to have lots 
--
 
a really nice increase in traffic in 
our North American stores this year.
 
Ben Kallo

Baird
 
Right.
 
George Blankenship
 
So, the stores are working.

Our next question comes from Ben Schuman from Pacific Crest Securities. 
Your line is open.
 
Ben Schuman

Pacific Crest Securities
 
Hi guys. Thanks. Can you give us any idea of what the regulatory credit 
revenue
 
was in Q4?
 
Elon Musk
 
Deepak, do you want to comment on that or is that...?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 


forwar
d, we are much more focused on getting to profitability and achieving 
our target without the benefit of the regulatory credits.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Exactly. Exactly. And in fact, maybe just to clarify further, as people 
may recall, there were three firm things 
that I promised we would do, that 
we would start production last year earlier than July and we started in June, 
and we would get to 20,000 units a year and that by the 
--
 
sorry, that we 
would deliver 20,000 units in 2013, and that by the end of 2013 we wou
ld 
exceed 25% gross margin. And I want to be clear that that 25% does not 
include regulatory credits.
 
Ben Schuman

Pacific Crest Securities
 
Okay. Great. And then can you maybe give us an update on the quality 
control situation just in terms of what percen
tage of the cars are still getting 
some sort of post
-
production touch
-
up work?
 
Elon Musk
 


--
 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think the ability for us to produce ca
rs at the steady rate of 400 plus a 
week is very much linked to our ability to produce quality cars on the line, 

 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. There was a time several months ago where every car t
hat came off the 
line would require some degree of rectification, but now that is very a fairly 


anything 
which is software related can be addressed by an over

the

year 
update which is something that no other car company can do. And I think

Goldman Sachs
 
Great. Thank you very much. I guess, my first question is just given what 

you said 
cancellations were going to be similar to what you saw in Q4 production. You 
have obviously the guidance of 4,500 obviously dependent on sort of what 
you do in terms of reservations during the quarter. But it sounds like that 
net reservation numbe
r is probably going to grind down a little bit in Q1, 
maybe even Q2 before kind of peaking up again, and is that correct and sort 
of how do you think about the trajectory of that overall net reservation 
number for this year?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, our intention i
s really not to have people wait six months for a car. We 
would much prefer that that our demand generation and production are 
closely synced so that when you order a car, you get it within less than a 
month. Really, you would ideally you want to get a car
 
within maybe a few 
weeks or something like that.
 

inconvenient for people. The limitation on production 
--
 
I mean, where we 
said we think we can do at least 4500 this quarter. It

--
 
that is not in any 
way a demand 
--
 
just to be clear in anyway a demand
-

purely a function of us being able to do steady
-
state production and do so 
efficiently.
 
Our focus in Q1 is on production efficiency, improving gross margin, 
and 

important for us, I think, to operate at that steady state for a bit before we 
try to drive the number higher. But I do want to emphasize we are not 
demand constrained, we are i
ntentionally production constrained. So I mean

Deepak on cash flow. I think you said Q1 
would be break
-
even. Can you just 
help us from a modeling standpoint think about the cash flow cadence as 

positive understanding that there are obviously some seasonality elements 
to t
he production and working capital and what have you?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Patrick, our focus, as Elon indicated, is on a variety of cost reduction and 
operation stabilization projects, which are all going to help us continue to 
generate more cash from our operatio
ns as each one of those buy. Not sure, 
if I can give you any further guidance beyond that. We feel very comfortable 

in a good place.

there will be

it will swing to positive during the year. I guess,

Elon Musk
 
Absolutely.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Right. Of course. And I think the key focus here is that, I know we are 
starting the quarter in 2013
 
here being profitable and then we just continue 
to grow on that.
 
Elon Musk
 

have very high confidence that we will have a profitable first quarter. And 
this is only the first 
--
 
this is the very first quarter that we actually have 
been at our target production rate.
 
So, we have had very little time to work on production efficiencies, 
improvements to gross margin, and all that. And despite all that, due to an 
enormous amount of har

it's really enormous amount of blood, sweat, and tears to get

difficult for me to alw
ays state the level of

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Your line is

Good evening guys. This is EJ in for Adam. Could we step through your 1Q 
guidance for a bit. Given your guidance for 4,500 
deliveries, mid

teen gross 

SG&A to increase moderately.
 

non
-
GAAP basis. Is there any rebucketing of R&D c
ost going on or is there 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think if you consider the combination of Model S sales, of our powertrain 
sales, our development revenue and mid
-
teens gross margin, I think th
e 
guidance would probably lead you to somewhere along those lines close to 
something in the break
-
even range to slightly positive. It should be close to 
break
-
even, and we were hoping to beat that.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Okay. So there is not really any rebu
cketing of R&D going on?

No.

Got it. Switching gears to CapEx for a second, I th
ink you guys have 
previously expected about $240 million of CapEx for full

year 2012, and 
ended up, I think, a little over $270 million. Is that something that you 
pulled forward from 2013 or is there something structurally that we should 
be looking out fo
r here?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We had some amount of pull ahead of completion of production tooling and 
completion of some of our equipment in
-
house, which resulted in higher 
CapEx as well as some of the infrastructure of the store and IT 
infrastructure. So overall,
 

surprising.

Our next question comes form Aaron Chew from Maxim Group. Your line is 
open.
 
Aaron Chew

Maxim Group
 
Good afternoon guys. 
Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could 
just drill a little bit deeper into the slower pace of reservations in Jan and 
Feb to date following the price hike going into effect at the year end. Is it 

om December but still over the 
October, November levels, maybe just given the big jump from 3Q to 4Q, if 

at a little bit more in detail?
 
Elon Musk
 

ecall offhand what our third quarter numbers 
were. The key point to bear in mind is like, as mentioned earlier is like, we 
have enough reservations right now to fill out the year, 
--
 
and just on sheer 
momentum sell every car we make, even if we closed ever
y store we have 
got.
 
So there were certainly cancellations in January that were as a function of 


of dem
and for rest of the year. So, if you 
--
 
okay, sorry, Jeff has confirmed, 
yes, it is certainly high in Q3.
 
Aaron Chew 
-
 
Maxim Group
 
Okay.
 
Elon Musk
 
If you exclude the sort of reservations that will go 
--
 
the cancellations that 
were just as function of 
asking people to confirm their order or not, we have 
a lot of demand in North America, I would say well in excess of half of about 
20,000 units per year demand or production target.
 
So you maybe have heard me say before where I think kind of demand 
breaks 
down between Asia, North America, and Europe is something like 10 
to 15 in North America, probably 10 in Europe, and maybe 10 to 15 in Asia. 
But it will take us some time to build up Asia, particularly China.
 

r all that much. I am quite certain 

concern like I said, literally, we could say goodbye to every store and every 
sales person and still meet that target, but we want to make sure
 

laid the ground work for an improvement above 20,000 units a year in 2014. 

year, it is about how do we exceed the 20,000 unit number next year.
 
Aaron Chew 
-
 
Maxim Group
 
Okay. Excellent. And if I could just 
--
 
real quick to the production side. Now 


have in that on a weekly
 
basis. I mean, especially if you are taking the 
4,500 in 1Q, is that up to 425 potentially, 450 or is there a way you can 
maybe quantify that just so we can understand how you are able to meet 
that 20k sort of in the back half?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I think our 
production rate will be in excess of a 20,000
-
unit
-
a
-
year 
annualized rate in the second half of the year. For this quarter and for 
probably most of next quarter, you have to decide what the relative focus is, 
and I think the important thing for us to focus
 
on right now is production 
efficiency and improving gross margin rather than scaling up production. 


really 
important that we improve the manufacturing efficiency and can 
reduce the number of temps essentially.
 
We still expect to see an increase in full
-
time employees from beginning of 
quarter to end of quarter. But it is really important that we make some 
signi
ficant progress in reducing the size of the temporary labor force and 
addressing the manufacturing inefficiencies.
 

and production efficiencies (indiscernible). If we wanted to, we co
uld raise 

right now. But we do so at the expense of efficiency and would have a lot of 

efficiency with 
the risk of being [repetitive] (ph).

The next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line is 
open.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays
 
Yes
. Just following
-
up on the question of focus, Elon, is really sort of 
optimizing your workforce, the primary barrier to getting to that 25% gross 

of your optimal production rate?
 
E
lon Musk
 

business is a pretty cost efficient business. I mean, it may not be great at a 
lot of things, sort of breakthrough technology and that kind of things, but it 
is pretty good 
at cost optimization. And so, in order for us to be competitive, 
it takes a lot of work on all fronts. It is certainly reducing the labor hours 
and the amount of overtime.
 
In December, even though we were cash flow positive and sort of profitable 
on a per 
car basis when all things are considered. The amount of overtime 
that was required to achieve the 400 cars per week was pretty extreme. So, 
that has improved dramatically just coming into January and then February. 

e of over 60 hours a week to 
almost 70 hours a week in December. Yes, exactly.
 
It was somewhere between 50% and 70% above 40 hours, and it was like 
an average 68
-
hour week that that people worked in December, which was 
also like a tough thing for people to
 
sustain just on a burnout level. But it 
also drives the cost to pretty extreme levels, because above 60 hours a 
week, you actually earn in double time; above 40 hours, you earn overtime. 
So, now, we have gone down to a point 

 
we are maybe a 50
-
hour week 
from something like 

 
like I said, something like almost a 70
-
hour week at 
average in December to about a 50
-
hour week now, and then driving that to 
kind of the mid
-
40s in March in addition to reducing the total number of 
people needed to get the car, so t
he labor hours per car are dropping 
dramatically, that may be the single biggest factor , but close behind it are 
things like logistics and supply parts, so another thing that we had to do that 
was really inefficient in fourth quarter was we had to fly a l
ot of stuff.
 
And when you fly something, it can cost as much 10 times what it costs to 
ship it by sea or rail or truck, particularly if it is heavy. And so, we had to do 
some dumb things like fly tires from the Czech Republic like (indiscernible) 
that was,
 
like one of the 
--
 
I want to punch myself on the face for that one.
 

hundred things like this, but as it turns out, we have a supplier for the 21
-

ch Republic, and it was taking 

 
we have terms of 
--
 
we have 30
-
day payment terms with them, and when they were shipping 
the tires, it actually took longer than 30 days to get to us. So the tires would 
get to us and would be passed you, so that happened li
ke a number of 
months, and then they put a hold on the shipments because we had not paid 

bill, so then they put the hold on that.
 
Anyway, that was just a big (indiscernible) to fly
 
a bunch of tires from Czech 
Republic to keep production going. That will give you one sort of extreme 

dramatically in the first quarter, and then in terms of supply parts, as I 
ment
ioned, there is a huge number of supplier cost reduction taking place 
because just as we have inefficiencies, so do our suppliers. One of the 

who are on the call, but the industry e
stimates for the number of cars that 
we make were quite low.
 
So, for example, there is an organization called IHS, which does the industry 
estimates on production volumes. They had us down at 1,500 units a year, 
and so for a number of our suppliers when 
--
 


tooled up for some puny number of parts for very low production volume, 
and then we were caught flat footed, when we said, no, we actually did 
me
an the order that we sent you.
 

had a number of such conversations where our suppliers finally realized that 

with
 
the parts. And I think we are starting to get beyond so many things like 
that and get into a steady cadence of production, and suppliers are starting 
to take our volume seriously and to offer us prices that are actually 
competitive in the market. Deepak, 
is there anything you want to add to 
that.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think those are all very good points plus our engineering teams are 
working closely and identifying efficiencies in material costs, both internally 

focus which is bringing a lot of costs 
down, very positive momentum on that.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sorry. One other thing I should add is like, for a number of suppliers we 
actually have price breaks that occur at certain volume levels and at certain 
calendar points, 

huge factor as we pass certain calendar points and certain production 

quite helpful.

Barclays
 
So, I g
uess given where you are in terms of your production now, and some 
of these issues seem to be in the rearview mirror, I mean, what is your sort 
of comfortability in sort of meeting or even exceeding that 25% target?
 
Elon Musk
 

ill be above 25% gross margin without 
considering zero emission credits by the end of this year.

Our next question comes from John Lovall
o from Merrill Lynch. Your line is

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call.
 
Elon Musk
 
Hey, John.
 
John Lovallo

Merrill Lynch
 
First question, Elon, would be for you. Despite all the noise in the press and 
all the back and f
orth, I mean do you see kind of the potential necessary 
additional planning for a driver of electric vehicle? I mean, do you see that 
as a headwind, are you hearing not from everybody?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think for a long distance
-
 
trip right now depending upon wh
ere are you in 
the country, a little bit of extra planning is needed. I think if you are in 
California or Nevada, we have got a good density of SuperChargers for long 

 
The ideal density of SuperC
hargers is maybe around 
--
 
roughly every 120 to 

every 200 miles, because we only have two. But, we have a bunch more 
SuperChargers that are going into the East Coast and across the 
country 
into Texas, the Seattle area, Chicago, and really we want to get to the point 

 
And, I think we are very close to that point, unlike this is some distant point 
in future. We are very rapidly deploying the 
network of SuperChargers and 
we are hooking that into the software in the cars. The navigation system will 
automatically route you to a SuperCharger. You just plug in wherever you 
want to go, and also to route you to the SuperCharger network to get 
whereve

 

away. And I think when people actually use the SuperCharger system, which 
is free by the way, it is like that seems to be l
ost in this whole debate like 

we are continuing to improve the rate at which the SuperCharger can put 
energy into the car. We have deployed some of the solar panels over the 
Super
Chargers. We are going to start planting a lot more which cuts our cost 
of electricity down, and it is pretty awesome I think.
 
So 
--
 
and then there is 
--
 

about a step change in supercharging technology coming l
ater this year, 


 


 
we 

--
 
who 
knows maybe who we will ultimately do it with.

we are goin
g to be pretty interested in that 
announcement when it comes out, and this whole thing of like does the car 

going to make it work even better over time. So it does lose 10% of i

year. I think it will be

occurs in this year and th
en obviously we want to make sure that we have 
laid the groundwork this year for a meaningful increase in 2014 as well.
 
Dan Galves 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. Great. And one other one, how much in terms of deferrals are you 
experiencing as you go through your re
servation book, and just wondering 
like how many people are really looking for a U.S. leasing option, and if you 
could provide us any update on the likelihood of the U.S. lease this year, 
that would be great. Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Well, we do see some def
errals taking place because we have a new 
color coming out which is actually really great color. I have to admit its 

any one delay that order, but it is an awesome red. So, we h
ave got lot of 



 
And so, there is a little bit of deferral o



second question.
 
Dan Galves 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Leasing.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Leasing. So all of the sales and all the things I mentioned thus far are 
with zero U.S. 
--
 

North America. That is something that we do want to offer maybe in the 
second half of the year. So, we w
ant to make sure that the terms of the 
lease like interest rates and all that are compelling. Even if we did zero 
leasing in North America, we could still sell all that productions this year.
 
So, leasing is entirely optional for us at this point. And I rea
lly want to come 

with kind of a lame leasing product. So, we are talking with some of the 
major financial institutions in the world about doing leasing, and those folks 
are progressi
ng in a good direction. But in order for us to get the best rates 

incremental money from leasing.
 

for thos
e international institutions to feel really comfortable with Tesla, and 

quarter and subsequent quarters is to give greater confidence to the large 
banks in giving us 
--
 
for our
 

usually happening to big financial companies.
 
And I do see long term, not so much this year, I think this year leasing is 
going to comprise of a very small percentage of our volume. But I do think 
next year l
easing will be a big factor. And within Europe, it will be at least 
some moderate factor this year. We already have a significant leasing deal 
signed with Athlon, which is one of the major European leasing companies.

Hi everyone. Congrats on hitting some pretty big milestones this quarter. 
Actually, just following up on the demand generation fo
r 2014, I was curious 


and the store openings.
 

our sleeve, 
but in terms of just general ideas for the next steps in marketing, do you 
pursue some traditional automotive channels or are you still primarily going 
to rely on the stores and perhaps word of mouth or other alternative 
methods?
 
Elon Musk
 
Ther
e is nothing better at the end of the day, Elaine, than word of mouth, 
which has really been fantastic. In fact, we see a lot of demand occurring 

mouth occurs, which I think is a rea
lly good predictor for future. As for the 
stores themselves, George?
 
George Blankenship
 
Yes. What we are seeing in the stores is that, some people come in, they see 
the car, and they want to put reservation down today, oh my gosh, how do I 
get one as soon 
as possible. Other people, they want to come back, they 
want to ask some questions and they keep coming back, and the beauty of 
the stores is they are located in locations where people frequent on a regular 

to stop back and ask a few 

 
I think when we start looking at 2014 and 2015, I think what we need to do 
is step back and understand that in our segment, the Model S segment of 
automobile sales world
-
wide, les
s than 30% of them are done in the United 
States. So, there is this massive opportunity for us as we go international 

the stores we have anywhere in the world are like the stores w
e have in 
North America in a high traffic shopping center.
 

having the same results and getting in front of people elsewhere outside the 
United States like we are doing here, and 

going to do in China. We are opening up in this really, really great shopping 


ng at in a 
couple of other countries in Europe.
 
And when people come in and they interact with us, when they are not 


s where I want 

store is open and the more cars are on the road around those stores, the 
more effective the stores become, so the longer store is open, the better.

reservations at this time or maybe perhaps some rough timing around when 
you might start to step up the marketing push on that one?
 
Elon Musk
 

d the Model S at all, in fact we literally only 



etty happy with 
how those reservations are going with basically zero effort. I mean, really 
the donut.
 
And I actually think that we are likely to see buying interest for Model X that 
is at least 70% thereabouts that of the Model S, and in certain countries
, I 
think it will probably exceed the Model S in demand.

11/7/14,Tesla,"Just wondering if you can give us any additional color on how you've gotten 
confident in 50,000 Model S deliveries in 2015?
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually, I don't think 50,000 is going to be super hard because if you look 
at sort of how we're exiting the year in 
production and demand, I think 
50,000 seems like a pretty solid number. We don't want to overreach, but I 
think 50,000 is pretty achievable number. That's more or less a modest 
extrapolation for where we will be at the end of this quarter.

Can you give us any kind of hard numbers on what you've seen in terms of 
order flow either geographically or just 
--
 
it sounds like since the product 
announcements, there's been an uptick. Is there any kind of numbers that 
you can provide on tha
t in terms of percentage increase quarter
-
over
-
quarter or something like that?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think what we've seen is 
--
 
it's difficult to extrapolate too much based on 
the announcement of the dual motor and auto pilot. There's some amount of 
people that wer
e waiting for an all
-
wheel drive car and that kind of thing, so 
that's why we're being sort of conservative. If you just extrapolated the 
demand since the announcement, it would be like 70,000 cars a year, but 
that's in terms of demand. But I think that wo
uld probably be unwise to 
state that as a steady state prediction.
 
So we're like more considering around 50,000, but it's 50,000 with high 
confidence just over half of those are North America and Europe and Asia 
are the remaining half.

Just a follow
-
up, the leasing program with your partners is it too early to get 
any sense of kind of how that's being received by the consumers or any 
estimates on kind of how much you see a leasing program like that in the 
addressable market for th
e car?
 
Elon Musk
 
I really tried to make the point in this shareholder letter that it's not a 
question of demand. Articles and of course out there are questioning 
demand. In the last quarter call, I really tried to emphasize it is not a 
question of demand b
ecause that sort of 70,000 order number, that's net 
orders, net of cancellations, that's with no advertising, no endorsements. So 
we don't pay anyone to pretend that they like our product. If you see our car 
in a movie, we didn't pay for it to be there. It
's just there. We have a fairly 
small number of stores. In a lot of places, we don't even have service 
centers.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And our dual motor cars are not there in any of the stores.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right, there is no dual motor cars for test drives. So obviou
sly, there's a 
whole bunch of things that we could do to stimulate demand if that were our 
problem. It is not our problem, but people don't quite appreciate how hard it 
is to manufacture something. It is really hard. I have great respect for 
people who man
ufacture large numbers of complex objects because there's 
like several thousand unique parts in a car.
 
Model S is quite a complicated car and you need all of them, that whole 
supply chain and whole internal production process marching at the same 
cadence i
n order to produce those cars. We're growing our production by like 
50% a year, year
-
over
-
year as far into the future as we can reasonably 
project. That's quite a big percentage growth for manufacturing a large, 
complex object. We would like to grow faster
 
of course, but it's also worth 
bearing in mind we have got one factory.
 
In some cases, when we upgrade the factory, it's like trying to change the 
wheels on the bus while it's going down the freeway, it's challenging. There 
are things where like we need r
eadily to do better which is like 
manufacturing growth and maybe not being too perfectionist about future 
product and things like that.

Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch. Your line is open.
 
John Lovallo 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
It's John Lovallo. Okay, first question and I missed Dan's question, so I 
apologize if any of this is repetitive. But first question is, you guys have 
done a very good job open sourcing your patents and showing all your cards 
to your competitors. With that in mind, I guess the question is would you 
consider providing more information to the analysts and investor community 
in the form of monthly sales data for one? Maybe showing the backlog again 
for two? Also maybe reinstating 
the regional mix that you guys used to give 
us on a quarterly basis.
 
Elon Musk
 
No, sorry. The last question was sort of a demand
-
related question as well 
and it really took pains to emphasize demand is not our issue. Production is 
our issue and being too p
erfectionist about future products those are 
legitimate things to be concerned about, but not demand. We have more 
demand than we can really address and there is a lot of things, levers we 
could pull to increase that demand which we're not pulling. So, it'
s really not 
an issue.
 
Part of the reason why we don't release the monthly deliveries number is 
just because it varies quite a lot by region and then the media tends to read 
all sorts of nonsense into deliveries. We'll have like 1000 cars reach a 
country o
ne month and none the next month and then people 
--
 
or like 100 
the next month trickle in or something because those were the numbers that 
were registered in one month versus the next and people say Tesla sales 
dropped by a factor of 10.
 
The boat arrived i
n January and not all the cars got registered in January 
and some got registered in February, then in March, it's back up again and 
so people read in all these things which are 
--
 
they assume deliveries are 
proxy for demand which is not the case. It is the
 
case for other car 
companies, but in our case it really needs be parsed into orders and 
deliveries. Then bear in mind, there are lots of things we can do to amplify 
orders.
 
Orders is not a true measure of demand, it is just a measure of that's the 
amount 
of stuff we need to do to meet our production and delivery number. 
So if we released orders, people would try to read the tea leaves and say 
demand for Tesla is growing or dropping. No, we're just not pulling the 
levers that we could pull because there is 
no point in trying to amplify 
demand substantially beyond our ability to produce it and deliver it. That 
would just make people upset.
 
John Lovallo

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. Next question is, you guys have been able to negotiate around 
using 
kind of the dealer network, state franchise laws in the U.S. I think your point 
is well taken, that non
-
Tesla salespeople might not be qualified to properly 
promote the brand and so forth. The question is with that in mind, how do 
you get comfortable
 
with selling vehicles to resellers in China that 
presumably don't have your best interest in mind or promoting the brand?
 
Elon Musk
 
We're not really selling to resellers anywhere in the world. So it may be 
possible that someone's claiming that they're a r
eseller of Tesla, this is a 
false claim.
 
John Lovallo

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. I'm just saying because when I looked on T
-
Mall for instance the first 
two lines of cars or first two rows of cars were actually all resellers or listed 
as reseller

Thanks for telling us that. We will make sure that is removed.

Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Your line is 
open.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
A couple things, one, can you just first quantify the impa
ct of the yen and 
euro for us going forward? The last time I think you discussed that you were 
not really hedging the yen exposure for self
-
purchases for example.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes. I think maybe there are two aspects to the answer here. On the euro 
side, w
e're net long given our deliveries in Europe and as the euro weakens, 
the effect on our revenue is immediate. As soon as we deliver cars we have 
that impact. On the yen side, clearly as the yen weakens it helps us sell 
cars. There is a fairly long lead tim
e on sale procurement and so the benefit 
of yen weakness has a lag effect for us. It comes further down as we start to 
procure sales at that lower yen and then that goes into vehicles a few 
months later.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
There is no hedging at thi
s point on either of those exposures?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
That is correct.
 
Elon Musk
 
Correct. There is effectively product hedging in the sense that we're 
delivering cars in Europe, North America and Asia and obviously just started 
delivering cars in Japan that d
oes provide a natural hedge, a most efficient 
hedge really for currency. But there are occasionally adjustments we need to 
make in the purchase price and at some point in the near future.
 
We're probably going to have to adjust the price of our car in euros
 
upwards 
because there has been a 7% change in the exchange rates of the euro 
versus the dollar. So we'll periodically have to make pricing adjustments if 
the exchange rate band gets too wide. I would certainly encourage anyone 
in Europe to purchase their 
car soon because we probably will have to make 
an adjustment there.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. Can you also please maybe just quantify or put some bookends 
around what you expect to be able to deliver on Model X in 2015 just given 
the later launch? I 
also had a question on battery costs. There are some new 
manufacturing processes for cathode material for example, being developed 
by Umicore and TODA and a few others that the claim is that you are going 
to see pretty significant declines in some of the k
ind of core components of 
lithium cells.
 
Is that something that's been factored into your expectations of a 30% cost 
reduction for these batteries over time?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. So with the X production, it's difficult for us to give 
--
 
I would have to 
give so
mething with very, very big bounding numbers for X production next 
year because it really depends on how well that production ramp goes. If we 
encounter any issues that require correction, then we obviously want to slow 
that production ramp down.
 
If things
 
go really well we will ramp it up. We do have the advantage with 

end of the car kind of sorted out with Model S that takes that part of the risk 
out of it.
 
With the falcon wing door
 
and the second row of seats and sort of a few 
other things, we're adding some very new stuff to 
--
 
that's really not out 
there, that never really has existed in a way that was useful. So it's hard to 
say what those numbers would be, except I'm confident t
hat the demand for 
the X will be very high once we're in production and again we will be 
production
-
limited because it is really a phenomenal car.
 
It really addresses a different market segment that some people want an 
SUV and some people want a sedan and 
they're about 50:50 in the market. 
So that's why we feel confident in predicting a 50% growth in orders and 
deliveries that's fairly comfortable next year and then at least a 50% growth 
in 2016 again and in subsequent years too.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
50% was just Model S, though, is that right?
 
Elon Musk
 
That's correct. Yes. So it would be some number 
--
 
fair enough. It would be 
some number greater than 50% if you include X. I am just reluctant to 
--
 
I 
can't communicate a greater level of
 
certainty than I actually know, that's 
why I'm reluctant to give a number. It's not because I secretly know it and 
I'm not telling you. Then with respect to the cathode materials, I think there 
is a lot of technology improvements that we'll be able to app
ly to the battery 
pack and the cathode anode separator, electrolyte, counter production, the 
whole works and some of these improvements are independent of the 
others.
 

--
 
whatever we build out for the Gigafactory 
has to work a
t least at the lab level. Let's say
 
this year
 
because we're 
making monster investments in equipment and there is a certain amount of 
time of a year or two at least from working at the lab level to working in 
small scale production and then at least a year 
or two after that before you 
can go from small production to mass production.
 
This is why we're not worried about like being blind
-
sided by some 
technology with the Gigafactory, it's because if it doesn't work in the lab 
right now, there is no point in wor
rying about it because you can't scale in 
that timeframe. Everyone and their (indiscernible) is approaching us about 
technology improvements. I think literally and their (indiscernible) in some 
cases. JB, do you want to add to that?
 
JB Straubel
 
Sure. We're
 
definitely talking to many, many different companies doing 
cathode technology development, anode and some of the other components 
including some of those you mentioned. I would be pretty shocked if there 
were any major improvements that were close enough 
to commercialization 
that we haven't been aware of or found out about. So a lot of those 
improvements are rolled into our thinking and there's great potential there.
 
Elon Musk
 
My top advice really for anyone who says they've got some breakthrough 
battery t
echnologies, please send us a sample cell, okay, don't send us 
PowerPoint. Just send us one cell that works with all appropriate caveats 
that would be great. That's really 
--
 
that sorts out the nonsense and the 
claims that aren't actually true. Talk is sup
er cheap; the battery industry has 
to have more BS in it than any industry I've ever encountered. It's insane.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Yes, I think this is more related to the manufacturing process for the 
material as opposed to some material innovation.
 
But, anyway, I would be 
surprised if there is anything out there that you guys aren't already well 
aware of. I was just asking whether that might be incremental to your 
forecast. It sounded like most of your projection was related to logistics and 
locatio
n and the scale of the cell and things along those lines.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, to be precise about our prediction was that we felt comfortable with at 
least a 30% improvement in cost or reduction in cost just based on the 
location and economies of scale. That's 
without taking any technology 
improvements into account and we will certainly do technology 
improvements. If we can't get to 30% even without technology 
improvements, somebody should shoot us because that would be in 
complete defiance of economies of scale
 
and obvious cost savings.

Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is 
open.
 
Brian Johnson 
-
 
Barclays
 
Some of the detailed numbers in accounting, so of the customer deposits, 
the inventory and lease accounting so I'll ju
st give all three. So for the 
customer deposits, it looks like they were roughly flat in fact down $1 million 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter, that seems to be the first time they haven't increased 
in quite a while if ever. What's going on there? Question two; invent
ory was 
up from about $600 million to $750 million.
 
How does that relate to the production ramp and some of the issues you 
talked about in the factory? Then number three, on the lease, you say you're 
going to continue the GAAP versus non
-
GAAP adjustments w
hich would 
seem to imply that you must have some backend risk for that lease with the 
third party not to be treated as a true sale. Could you maybe describe the 
type of lease support you've worked out with your bank partners?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sure, Brian. So o
n the customer deposits, there's a bit of noise in those 
numbers that also includes final payments that our Model S customers make 
just before delivery. If you exclude that noise, our customer reservations or 
customer deposits were actually up quarter
-
over
-
quarter. So we don't see 
any issue there. On leasing, with our banking partner we're taking lease 
accounting because our customers do have the option to return the car and 
we have the option to buy back those cars. And so given that uncertainty at 
the bac
k end, we feel it's conservative accounting to follow the lease 
accounting approach for GAAP. What was your second question in the 
middle? Can you please clarify?
 
Brian Johnson 
-
 
Barclays
 
The inventory and then the lease accounting.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Can you ju
st clarify further on your inventory question?
 
Brian Johnson 
-
 
Barclays
 
Yes. Your inventory was up somewhat substantially. Just trying to 
understand, is that work in process? Is that finished goods? Kind of what 
drove that given if you just looked at vis
-
a
-
vis deliveries; you wouldn't 
expect that increase in inventory?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
There were three factors that contributed to it at a high level. One was raw 
material inventory, second was work in process and third was service. Raw 
material inventory was 
higher because we were expecting to produce higher 
volume in Q3 that we did not achieve and that's part of our inventory. Work 
in process is just normal increase given that our production run
-
rate on a 
weekly basis is increasing. We have more inventory in 
the pipeline and the 
manufacturing process itself.
 
Finally for our service centers, we're sending out more parts and stocking 
these service centers so that we can provide more timely and immediate 
service to our customers not have them wait, not incur addi
tional freight 
cost. It's a sensible and the right customer thing to do, those sort of explain 
pretty much the increase in inventory.

about 2000 units less than our plan for third quarter.

Our next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. 
Your line is open.
 
Patrick Archambault

Goldman Sachs
 
Just a couple from me, first, let's talk about the Model X being p
ushed back 
a little you said, I think, based on more testing and validation. Is there any 
kind of specific engineering challenges that you've encountered here or is 
this more of a precautionary approach? Second to that, how confident are 
you in the new lau
nch date? I understand that the ramp is sort of a separate 
issue, but being able to get it at least the first one off the line in this new 
timeframe.
 
Elon Musk
 
It's worth saying that making one of something is quite easy. Making lots of 
something consisten
tly that's going to last a long time is extremely hard. In 
fact, it is way harder to make the machine that makes the machine that it is 
to make the machine in the first place. The production of the car is way 
harder than actually, I would say the design of
 

Alphas done, we were almost done with the beta, it's like basically right now.
 
We could certainly 
--
 
it would be quite easy for us to make one, a handful of 
production units that are saleable and homologated that doesn't really 
move 
the needle. So what really matters is at what point can we get to scale 
production of a really high quality car and that's really in the third quarter.
 
We also learned a lesson in manufacturing that you have issues that are 
sometimes one out of 100, b
ut unless you make 100 of something, you don't 
see it. Then you think the car is all good, but actually randomly one out of 
100 is wrong, but you don't know necessarily which one out of the 100, then 
you've got to go look at all 100 cars.
 
So just once you 
get into volume manufacturing there are just these 
statistically rare issues, but you really need to make a bunch of something in 
order to know that it's there. We want to make sure we do that with the X, 
that's really just a lesson we've learned.
 
Financia
lly of course, it's only going to matter when we're at volume 
production. I do think the X is going to be something quite special, but it's 
hard to get there. It's hard to engineer and it's hard to produce.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. I don't
 
think anybody obviously, would fault you for making sure that 
it's up to your standard before putting it out there. But I guess is there 
something just in the design of these Alphas or the testing of these Alphas 
that has come up that has just made you pu
sh it back or is it more just an 
abundance of caution?
 
Elon Musk
 
There is no big thing, there are a whole bunch of little things. It's really 
about getting the details right and I think people will appreciate that we got 
the details right, but it's 
really about getting the details right. Yes, if you get 
all the details right, it's like the difference between a diamond with a flaw 
and a diamond without a flaw. But it's hard to do that, but that's what we're 
going to do.

Just my second one, if I may, getting back to the Gigafactory comment, the 
idea that you will be able to produce your first jointly developed cell with 
Panasonic in 2016 obviously, that's a shorter time frame than a lot of us 
expected. Might it be pos
sible just at a high level just to take us through the 
steps that you think need to happen to be able to achieve that deadline? 
Clearly, that's positive if that happens, obviously, given the importance for 
the GenFree program.
 
JB Straubel
 
Sure, I can comme
nt on that a little bit. It is a slight pull ahead and we're a 
bit ahead of schedule in the Gigafactory than what we previously 
communicated. Some of the main reasons that is so important are what you 
alluded to retiring risk and being ready to ramp up ver
y quickly with Model 
3. We felt it was important to go as fast as we possibly could and start some 
production operations in 2016. There are lot of steps that have to happen 
there, generally, getting the factory itself ready, getting the staff and the 
team 
that needs to operate the factory ready is a huge exercise.
 
Elon Musk
 
Basically the pilot plant at the Gigafactory is as big as I think the next 
biggest or pretty close at least, to the next biggest 
--
 
to any other lithium
-
ion factory out there. I'll not s
ure which one would be bigger.
 
JB Straubel
 
The scope and scale is huge. We wanted to be prudent and make sure that 
we were planning far enough head that we could stabilize quality and 
stabilize sort of the infrastructure of the plant well ahead of 
needing to ramp 
to very high volume for Model 3.
 
Elon Musk
 
I would also just like to compliment Panasonic on being an awesome partner 
here. They really have been great. They're going all out.

Our next question comes from Ge
orge Galliers with Evercore ISI. Your line is 
open.
 
George Galliers

Evercore ISI
 
Yes. I had a quick strategic question with respect to China, back at Q1, I 
think you mentioned that you would like to do local production in China at 
some point in the futur
e and I just wanted to know what would be the 
catalyst for that decision? Will it be based on unit volume growth or is it 
based on a timeline that you have in mind? Perhaps you could elaborate a 
bit on that, particularly in the context of the recent announ
cements by the 
NBRC with respect to support for electric vehicles.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. Essentially, it's not going to make sense in the long term to be 
transporting vast numbers of cars, particularly sort of Model 3 more 
affordable cars across the Pacific to C
hina. It's going to make a lot more 
sense to do local production there. So it would be really driven by running 
out of factory space in California and then we have got a choice; build a 
factory in somewhere other than China for Chinese consumption which 
do
esn't make a ton of sense like when you talk about a 1.5 ton to 2 ton 
vehicle product it makes sense to build that where it's going to get used.
 
So I would expect over time for there to be actual factories in China as well 
as in Europe, as well as more fac
tories in North America. Our goal is to 
accelerate the advent of electric vehicles. In order to do that we need to 
make a lot of cars and then we're also sort of happy over time to support 
other manufacturers in making electric vehicles and we're in pursui
t of that 
objective and have been since creating the company.

Out of interest, the Chinese government clearly also are very interested in 
supporting the development of electric vehicles and particularly, the 
development of el
ectric vehicles domestically. Has the government 
approached you at all with respect to how you might be able to help some of 
the domestic players with their electric vehicle development particularly in 
light of the fact that you've opened up your patents f
or others?
 
Elon Musk
 
We've had a lot of conversations with the Chinese government. They've 
actually been quite supportive. One of the things we're working through 
right now is getting on the electric vehicle list which has a bunch of 
requirements on it. We
're working with the Chinese government to try to get 
on that list, but yes, they've not made any sort of demands of Tesla or 
anything like that and they know that we're quite keen on electric vehicles 
and helping companies wherever they may be in the worl
d China or 
otherwise. I think that's been well received.

Any color on the warranty accrual of $14 million? How many vehicles is that 
across? I think it's com
ing across something like $300 per vehicle. Is that 
based on the production of the Model S? Should we consider that as a higher 
accrual going forward or is this a one
-
off type of catch
-
up accrual?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
So this is for about 30,000, I am giving you r
ound numbers here of cars 
delivered prior to Q3 and the going forward run
-
rate for warranty accrual is 
slightly lower than what we did as a onetime because there was some legacy 
design issues that we have fixed already. We're in this continuous mode of 
imp
rovement on reliability overall.

You mentioned up front that North America deliveries were higher which I 
was a little surprised by because I thought you were still trying to get 
product out to Europe and China. So why was North America 
so strong if 
you're still trying to fill the pipeline in the other regions?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
For Q3 deliveries well our production overall was also higher than 
--
 
so 
you're talking about September here or 
--
 
either way, whether you look at 
Q3 or September, our
 
production in Q3 this year was higher than prior year.

Colin Langan

Yes, it does, I mean 
--
 
the Q3 
deliveries, the majority of them were in North 
America but I would have thought that since you're trying to build up 
inventory in Europe and in Asia that you would have more going to those 
regions. Shouldn't most of your demand be going into where you're t
rying to 
fill up the inventory?

I think there's an assumption here that we try to fill up inventory, that 
doesn't make sense. We don't have inventory.

I guess my point is that you have orders, you have a lot of 
--
 
you're starti
ng 
in Europe, so shouldn't there be a lot more pent
-
up demand and more 
orders in those regions where you haven't been selling before? I guess that's 
what I'm trying to get at.
 
Elon Musk
 
We've been selling in Europe for a while, China is new. We're only jus
t 
getting going in China. We only had our first deliveries like 6 or 7 months 
ago, six months ago. We only have two stores and small number of service 
centers and we don't have super charged infrastructure built out there. So it 
doesn't make sense to put a
 
ton of cars in China, in areas where we don't, 
for example, have a service center in reasonable proximity or any super 
chargers.
 
In China, what actually has made customers most upset is that we won't 
deliver their car unless it can be reasonably be servic
ed or charged and then 
some of them are like well they still want their car, but then we don't want 
them to have a bad experience. So we can certainly expect that the growth 
in China deliveries over time as we build out the infrastructure in China.

Okay and then just one last question, is there any update on the Panasonic, 
how much they're planning to put into the Gigafactory? Because last update 
I saw I think there wasn't a number that they're planning to invest.
 
JB Straubel
 
Speculation 
about a number, yes, I think we haven't communicated a 
specific number from their point of view. We have only talked about a 
project estimate total and I think Panasonic, as Elon said earlier, has been 
very forward
-
leaning to make the commitment to investm
ents at the times 
they need to keep their project moving ahead. There have been a few 
announcements from them recently in the past few months about that.
 
Elon Musk
 
It's on the order of $1.5 billion to $2 billion from now through full production 
at the Giga
factory maybe more than that. Maybe while we're on the 
Gigafactory, I was a little bothered about some of the reports on the 
Gigafactory, no question that you've asked, but I just want to make a 
comment on this. There is like a lot of press about $1.2 bill
ion tax incentive 
package from Nevada that Tesla got and is this like really a good idea for 
Nevada.
 
It is like a super good idea for Nevada, that's why every member of the 
Nevada legislature, Democrat or Republican even if they were at the furthest 
corner
 
of the state, voted in favor of the package; it's over like 20 years. I 
realize you didn't ask this question. It kind of bugs me that like I thought we 
got an okay incentive package, given the scale of the thing, but not a super 
huge one.
 
When you conside
r that we're talking about it in terms of the output of this 
factory something on the order of several billion dollars per year for 20 years 
and growing. The Nevada tax incentive, over the period of time that it 
applies is maybe a few percent of that and p
ales in comparison that say, 
Boeing got for keeping one model of the 777 in Washington State. Anyway, 
sorry to go on that side track there but

Our next question comes from Andrew Fung with CLSA. Your line is open.
 
Andrew Fung

CLSA
 
Following
-
up
 
on China, could you provide perhaps a bit of a timeline on the 
build out of your infrastructure? How much does China drive your 
expectations for next year's volume growth? Then also back to the Model X, 
how confident are you in delivering the current Mode
l X orders in 2015, the 
ones that are already placed?
 
Elon Musk
 
I wouldn't say we're strongly dependent on China for deliveries next year. In 
fact, I believe even if we did not sell in China next year, we could probably 
still meet our targets. So even if t
here was zero China sales. We would like 
to exceed the targets, but even if we had no sales in China, we would still 
achieve the targets we mentioned in the quarterly earnings letter. With 
respect to Model X, I think realistically somebody's ordering the M
odel X 
right now or just changed the website to this effect; the car is going to get 
delivered in early 2016. So we're essentially sold out of 2015.
 
Andrew Fung

CLSA
 
Just following
-
up on your answer on China, I mean, we're certainly positive 
on your dema
nd globally, but just trying to get a sense of perhaps how 
demand is trending in China and whether you choose to allocate cars there 
as opposed to different regions is obviously your decision. Just trying to get 
a sense of where we can expect volumes to tr
end over the next couple of 
years?
 
Elon Musk
 
We feel pretty confident with at least a 13% increase next year and a 13% 
increase the year after. Probably even could go out several years with at 
least a 50% over time on average increase, but in order for us 
to have that, 
we need to lay the groundwork in a particular region well in advance of when 
we need those deliveries to occur because we need to have service centers 
and super chargers and logistics and all that.
 
So you can't sort of just go into a 
country and instantly have service centers 
everywhere and chargers everywhere and all that kind of stuff. It takes time 
to build these things out and to understand the nuances of the local market. 
So it's like what we're doing in China right now is really 
laying the 
foundation for future growth.

We haven't talked about it.
 
Andrea James

Dougherty & company
 
How do we think about it?
 
Elon Musk
 
First of all the final assembly line is just one element of the factory. I mean, 
we did oversize the final assembly line becau
se if we're going to make a new 
final assembly line. We want to have significant growth potential. So I think 
we feel safe in saying it's not going to be a growth constraint in the next few 
years, the final assembly line. The big thing in the first half of
 
next year is 
going to be the new body line creating sort of the skeleton of the car and the 
exterior body panels and all that which is intended to be a step change 
technology improvement from our current body line and allow for a much 
greater volume as we
ll as exceptional precision in the way the car is made.
 
We're aiming with the new body line for a level of precision that no car in the 
world has. You should be able to practically use our car as a yardstick with 
the new body line that's getting made.

Dougherty & company
 
Okay. A philosophical one on the Model X, I guess forgive me if this is 
sacrilege, but it's not clear to me that the Model X is really necessary. Your 
long
-
term vision's always been bigger than the Model S platform with these
 
higher cost vehicles being a bridge to coming down market.
 
In my view, you've conceived of and promised the X before you really 
realized the S has served as that bridge in some ways with the capital 
raises, to put it in the form of a question, how importa
nt is the Model X to 
where you want to be in like 2020 and how do you think about what the 
Model X brings to the product portfolio?
 
Elon Musk
 
You are right, the Model X isn't necessary to get to the Model 3 which has 
been the goal of the company all along.
 
The Gigafactory is certainly needed 
for the Model 3 and the Gigafactory is going to take us like about 2.5 to 3 
years to build and get to serious production.
 
So we are kind of making the Model X in the meantime, but it will serve a 
purpose of generating g
reat cash flow to support the Model 3 and obviously 
would reduce the dilution and the amount of capital that we need to raise for 
investors for the Model 3 because it should generate a lot of positive cash 
flow. I think the Model X is going to be something
 
special. I mean it's sort of 
an expensive car, but it's really going to be something special.

Our next que
stion comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is 
open.
 
Ryan Brinkman

JPMorgan
 
It's really on direct leases as it relates to cash flow. It looks like you invested 
about $35 million there to direct lease 347 vehicles in 3Q. What you're doing 
now 
is, of course, very small in relation to your $2.4 billion of cash. I guess 
what I am wondering is if we should be potentially modeling a lot more 
going forward? You refer in the letter to I think 3000 to 3500 leased cars in 
4Q, but also that a large porti
on of them will be through the bank partner 
lease program.
 
Can you help with what large portion means and how should we think about 
modeling direct leases going forward? Could this growth become material or 
will it be phased out with the bank partner progr
am?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think we will continue doing some degree of direct leasing. It gives us 
flexibility and allows us to be in states where our banking partners cannot be 
there. I suspect we will probably double, from Q3 going into Q4 our direct 
leasing. So it's still not going to be a big part of the capital required in 
relation to the cash we have. We always have the option to go and get some 
bank warehouse lines to fund, but we don't want to do it while there's no 
need. Why pay interest expense
 
on that when there's no need to at this 
time?

Got it. Last question just curious on what extent the Model X and Model 3 
are being developed in parallel or is there some work on the 3 that maybe 
accelerates once you can take 
resources, shift them from the X after it 
launches? What I am trying to figure out is if the timing on the launch of the 
X reads through in any way at all to the timing of your more mass market 
vehicle? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
The development of the small motor 
actually, we have got a big and a small 
motor, big and small drive unit and for like the performance 85, the dual 
motor car, the standard sort of sport big motor in the rear and smaller 
motor drive unit in the front and that smaller drive unit in a lot of 
ways is a 
precursor for the Model 3. It represents a significant improvement in cost, in 
steady state power, a number of other factors.
 
It's basically 
--
 
it's like a second generation motor essentially, that's good 
pathfinder for 3 on the powertrain side. 
Obviously, the Gigafactory is very 
much being geared towards the Model 3 pack needs, for the rest of the 
Model 3, it really depends on 
--
 
we could obviously, one easy thing to do 
would be to just make a 20% smaller Model S and then that would be the 
easy t
hing to do, but I think we might be able to do a few more interesting 
things than just that.

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
open.
 
Adam Jonas

Morgan Stanley
 
Just two quick questions here. Elon, in a worl
d of completely automated 
driving going a bit out in the future here, what do you think will define a 
successful automobile company? Why would people buy a Tesla if their 
hands are never actually never touching a steering wheel or if their feet 
never actua
lly make contact with an accelerator pedal?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well that's pretty far in the future.
 
Adam Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Even for you?
 
Elon Musk
 
Our definition of far is other people's definition of not that far. But, yes, it 
seems like in the long term tha
t there will be 
--
 
that people won't be driving 
cars or maybe they'll be like some auxiliary steering thing that pops out only 
in an emergency that looks more like a Nintendo controller or PlayStation 
controller or something like that. We're still pretty f
ar from that in Tesla 
terms and it has to be approved by regulators and everything.
 
Before such things are really mainstream and approved by regulators, it's 
probably no sooner than seven years from now and could be up to 10, I 
think, because you have to h
ave that car that's capable of doing that and 
the regulators need to see that it's really working as promised for a few 
years before they approve it. But I think it's quite likely that Tesla will be the 
leader in making cars like that. Anything you want to
 
add?
 
JB Straubel
 
I think people will still care about many of the same things that they care 
about today, value and performance of the platform, range, efficiency, the 
detail and fit and finish of the interior, maybe even more so than previously 
since the
y can really focus on those things.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think there will be some amount of car sharing for sure, but I think there's 
like a limit to the whole sharing thing. There is an important role for sharing 
but it's not 
--
 
most things don't get shared. Peopl
e could easily share their 
house or their clothes or their bicycle or something like that and they do a 
little bit with like Airbnb or something like that, but mostly not. Take houses, 
you could triple housing inventory.

Just as
 
a follow

up, a couple months ago I believe you said something like 
our share price is kind of high right now. Obviously, the stock's pulled back a 
bit, given the very high ambitions of the company which would require I 
think, to use your words, monster Ca
pEx to carry out, could you update us 
on your latest posture for potentially seeking additional funding from the 
capital markets to help seize the growth opportunities that you have? Or are 
you more in a self
-
funded status mode for now? Thanks very much.
 
E
lon Musk
 
We don't see any near term need to raise money. We're spending a lot to 
increase production capability of the S like to maybe be able to make more 
of them and make them more efficiently, obviously to build the X and to get 
the Gigafactory and the 
long lead stuff on the 3 going. But so far it doesn't 
look like we're going to need to raise capital and maybe not at all until the 3. 
But I should say, if there was something we could think of to spend money 
without being wasteful which is quite hard, the
n we would do so.
 
But right now, we're spending money about as fast as we can think of 
intelligent ways to spend money and not always being intelligent about it, of

My bigger question is, Elon, over the past few calls and hate to bring up 
demand again, but just to get this out here you estimate by region how big 
m
arkets were. Could you give us an update as you guys' assessment evolves 
over time as well, China, North America, Europe? Then specifically in China, 
we hear a lot of different types of rumors about delivery issues in that 
market. Maybe give us an update o
n how big you think the market is for the 
S right now in each of those regions?
 
Elon Musk
 
Right now is not 
--
 
as I was saying earlier in China, we need to have more 
service centers, we need to have more super chargers, there are some local 
charging nuances
 
that need to be sorted out. The delivery experience hasn't 
been always as good as we would like it.
 
Before one tries to scale up and put a ton of cars into the market, the 
infrastructure needs to be there, the Tesla infrastructure needs to be there 
to sup
port it. So we're building that infrastructure very quickly.
 
In fact, I have seen that our China team is building it out faster than any 
region that Tesla's gone into before. I think our China team's executing quite 
well in that regard, but still, there is
 
a rate, a certain rate and do it right.

So how big do you think the market can be?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well like I said, feel very confident of 50,000 Model S vehicles a year. It's 
probably more than that, but that's the number we're con
fident of. There are 
obviously also macroeconomic factors of how is the given economy doing 
that we don't control. So it's difficult to make these predictions without also 
knowing what the macroeconomic climate's going to be in each of these 
countries, exc
ept to say we think 50,000 next year is a pretty good number 
even if the economy isn't great in certain parts of the world.

There are a few things that are important like we have made a pretty big 
improvement to the seat comfort. That's important, particularly the next
 
generation seats that they can order with the P85

improvement. The sun visor

I mean there's like all these silly things that 
have 
--
 
the sun visor by the way will be offered to all existing Model S 
owners as well because I think the
 
sun visor we came out with in the 
beginning was not great.
 
This one is actually bigger and properly blocks the sun; it's got a great 
mirror. Importantly, the strident sticker that is normally on sun visors has 
been minimized and moved to the left and no l
onger also includes the 
warning in French, that sticker drives me crazy. So it's a way better sun 
visor. But there is sort of steady stream of improvements. Jerome is there 
anything you want to I think maybe?

It just sounds like steady state incremental improvements nothing that 
really stands out. In terms of what you're talking about in terms of reducing 
the number of options on the Model S to r
amp production is that because 
you're pulling things in that are not going to be in the base price or is there 
certain options you're just no longer going to offer? Does that have any 
effect on the blend of the ASP going forward for 2015?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think
 
it's probably not going to have a big effect on the average sales 

fewer versions of the Model S in order to streamline manufacturing and thus 
be able to ramp production better and hav
e better control in logistics and 
not have like a million variations on the Model S. The dual motors, we're not 
going to produce the dual motor 60
-
kilowatt hour car at all.
 
We're not taking additional orders for the performance 85. We're only doing 
the per
formance 85 dual motor and we're cancelling green and brown as 
colors. These are a few examples, but this helps us streamline the 
manufacturing and supply chain logistics and enables us to better ramp 
production.

up on the stationary energy storage, looking at 
the poten

we're looking at something that could be 5% to 10% of total grid capacity 
globally as well as looking at the emerging markets and needing micro grid 
solutions. As you guys are looking at spe
nding money obviously, you are 
involved here, how big an initiative is this for the company at this point?
 
Elon Musk
 
Stationary storage is pretty significant in the long term. It's a vital element 
for going to sustainable power generation. So we are 
currently assuming 
that somewhere around 30% or so of the Gigafactory output would be aimed 
at stationary storage, that's a rough guess. But one way or another 
stationary storage is going to be a really huge thing that needs to be done.
 
JB Straubel
 
It's de

Really quickly, I'm sorry if I missed it, I dialed in a little b
it late, but I 
wanted to talk about average transaction prices and also wait times on the 
ATP side. We can look at the deliveries and divide by the revenues and get 
to a number. I wanted to see how that progression was tracking intra
-
quarter and if there w
as any decision to bring all wheel drive, dual motors 
and autonomous features forward versus prior expectations given the spec 
that a lot of your customers were demanding at higher price points, maybe 
that's another way to look at demand question, I guess 
is my theory. 
Separately just very quickly where are we wait times for the Model S today 
versus where we were sort of three months ago just as a proxy? Thanks.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
On the average transaction prices, we're not seeing any significant changes 
from a 
content perspective as we look at Q3 versus prior quarters. Clearly, 
as we go forward and the addition of dual motor is going to improve over 
average transaction price. However, when we look at international markets 
as we talked earlier, the significant we
akening of the European currencies is 
having an impact on our international average transaction price and it's 
lowering in total, our average transaction price slightly.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes because the euro dropped like 7% or something like that.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Co
rrect. And then the same thing with the Norwegian krone and the Swiss 
franc, they all were in the 7% to 8%, they had a significant impact, but not 
from a content perspective. The underlying fundamentals are good.
 
James Albertine

Stifel Nicolaus
 
Okay and 
just the wait times?
 
Elon Musk
 
It depends on which version of the car that you get and where you are in the 
world because obviously, if you're not in the, say the West Coast of the U.S., 
there's going to be a longer wait time to transport the car to 
wherever you 
are. So the wait times, right now I think are anywhere from maybe 6 to 7 
weeks in the best case to four months.

We saw higher revenues and 
significantly better profitability in our Energy business. I mean, but I think 
with solar, it may have been the best quarter ever for solar.
 
We achieved GAAP net income of over $300 million, increased cash and 
equivalents by $731
 
million and achieved a greater than 20% gross margin 
for Model 3. And moreover, we expect to again have positive net income and 
cash flow in Q4. And I believe our aspirations I think it will be for all quarters 
going forward. I think we can actually be po
sitive cash flow and profitable for 
all quarters going forward, leaving aside quarters where we may need to do 
a significant repayment, for example in Q1 next year. But I think even in Q1, 
I think we can be approximately flat in cash flow by end of quarter
.
 
This quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees 
across the board from sales, production, delivery, service, energy, 
engineering, finance and all of our G&A teams. Really, every part of the 
business executed incredibly well. I 
want to thank everyone again for your 
incredibly hard work. I especially want to thank customers who helped 
-
 
it's 
like, I've never even heard of this, maybe this has happened before, but I've 
never heard of it, of a case where a company's customer has act
ually cared 
about the future of the company so much that they volunteer their time to 
help the company succeed.
 
I think that's amazing. You just don't see that anywhere. So, yeah, it really 
chokes me up me up actually. This quarter we started rolling out V
ersion 9.0 
of our software, which is the biggest software upgrade in 3 years. And Model 
3 received a 5
-
Star Safety Rating in every category and sub
-
categories. And 
it got less probability of injury of any car that the U.S. government has ever 
tested.
 
Looki
ng ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3s in Q4. 
And expect that trend to continue into Q1. And we're excited to bring Model 
3 to Europe and China early next year, given that the market for mid
-
sized 
premium sedans in those regions is even
 
larger than in North America.
 
I said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable. 
But this quarter was an important step towards that and I'm incredibly 
excited about what lies ahead. So this is 
-
 
yeah, just so proud of the Tesla 
te
am, our customers. We really appreciate the support of our long
-
term 
shareholders, and yeah, I suppose, on behalf of the Tesla team we're super 
appreciative of your support to what's obviously been a very difficult time.
 
All right, now, let's move to 
-
 
let
's start up with vehicle safety. Madan, who 
is our Lead Vehicle Safety Engineer, been with the company for a long time. 
Madan, how many years has it been, that we've been working together?
 
Madan Gopal
 
It's my 10th year. 10 years.
 
Elon Musk
 
10 years, 
wow. So, yeah, I've been working with Madan for 10 years. We 
had so many conversations on vehicle safety. Wow.
 
And you know what, we're really go 
-
 
try to go the extra mile with vehicle 
safety. Not just 
-
 
in fact, there is a series of government mandated t
ests. 
But what some companies do is they game the system. So they know where 
the 
-
 
site full impact is going to be. They strengthen it right in that position.
 
At Tesla, we're like, okay, what is the weakest point in the car; let us test it 
with that positi
on. So, it's 
-
 
the actual safety is not fully captured in the 
tests, because we anti
-

 
Madan Gopal
 
Thank you, Elon. Just want to give you a very quick background about 
myself.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Madan Gopal
 
Like I said, I joined
 
Tesla, 10 years. I'm extremely very happy to mention, 
working with extraordinary set of very passionate and very hard working 
individuals, and that essentially shows in our product. So that's very 
important for us. And also important is our principle miss
ion statement on 
safety, because what we want to do is, safety has been 
-
 
is probably the 
important factor for our vehicle, it's not just for electric vehicle, any vehicle, 
period.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Madan Gopal
 
And that fundamental difference differentiates 
us, so which essentially helps 
us to keep adding new features and new safety technology. And that's very 
important and that shows in Model 3, latest thing that we have. Also the fact 
that we have electric vehicle, the design and architecture gives us a 
fun
damental benefit over traditional vehicles. And that takes care of, for 
example, whether you have a block of engine in the front, where we can 
work with using a pretty much open architecture in the front. And the whole 
fact that you have all the electrical
 
and high voltage, and motors and all of 
that, almost below the center gravity of the vehicle gives a lowest probability 
of the reduced rollover risk. And that significantly benefits.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. I think, architecturally, we have Newton on our side. An
d having Isaac 
Newton on your side is definitely the way to go.
 
Madan Gopal
 
Right, exactly. So in the latest series of tests, I would like to specifically talk 
about Model 3. NHTSA did the series of tests, actually four tests, one frontal, 
two side and 
one rollover test. And if you look at, they have been calculating 
how can we distinguish within the 5
-
Star, there are so many vehicles that 
already gets 5
-
Star. And if you look at within the 5
-

 
Elon Musk
 
They're just not all the same, not 
all the same.
 
Madan Gopal
 
Yeah, exactly. So if you look at there, there is a metrics we came up with, 
which is a part of US NCAP rating itself, as a lowest probability of injury. And 
Model 3 has the lowest, and just to give you a context, there are total o
f 900 
plus vehicles since 2011, which have been rated. So the fact that Model 3 is 
the best among all the 943 to be exact. So that speaks the volume. And I'm 
very happy to say that Model 3 has achieved.
 
We are not stopping right now. What we would like to 
do next is how we can 
make use of the active safety and autopilot features, and make it even more 
improvement, so the next area that we are focusing on, how to integrate 
active and passive safety. That's our next area of challenge, which we will 
improve fo
r sure.
 
Elon Musk
 
Again, it's worth noting that the safety extends to not just people in the car, 
but also pedestrians.
 
Madan Gopal
 
Correct.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, so not having a big engine block in front of the car is really helpful, so 
because if you 
-
 
if a ca
r would hit a pedestrian, we will get to active safety 
next, because the best thing is, obviously, not just to hit car or pedestrian. 
The fact that the hood can dent so far in is really helpful, because it ends up 
being like sort of 
-
 
like a trampoline or 
like a 
-
 
it has 
-
 
you don't move a rock 
underneath it. It's very helpful.
 
So it's helpful for pedestrian safety and for the safety of the people in the 
car. And then, even if you are to have like a head on collision with another 
car, the extended sort of c
rumple zone of a Tesla Model S, X or 3 is helpful 
to the people in the Tesla and the people in other car. So it's not just the 
people in the car.
 
Madan Gopal
 
I'd like to add one item, which is essentially how we look at the real world 
safety, which has alw
ays been an important element for Elon. So if you look 
at our blog post, we showed how we handle the center pole impact in the 
frontal. By the way this is not part of NCAP rating. Just to show, how we go 
over and above the NCAP rating to make sure its real
 
world safety. That's 
very important for us.
 
Elon Musk
 
Exactly. That's what I meant, like anti
-
game the system like here, what is 
the worst way that the car could be hit, not just sort of strength in where we 
know the test will happen and that kind of thin
g. So obviously, we're all in 
these cars, our friends in the cars, families in the cars, so we care a great 
deal about safety. A lot of people think safety is boring, but not at Tesla.
 
So thanks, Madan, it's a 
-
 
thank you for your decade of hard work and t
he 
rest of the Tesla safety team. And with that, let's move onto Autopilot. And 
you guys could just give an update on sort of Autopilot software, AI and 
hardware. Yeah.
 
Stuart Bowers
 
That's great. This is Stuart Bowers. We will soon begin to rollout the te
am's 
most advanced Autopilot feature ever, Navigate on Autopilot. In our last 
release, we launched a new set of neural network that combine together, 
provide a view of everything happening around the car. With Navigate on 
Autopilot, we'll use information t
o understand exactly where the car is on the 
highway system and to automatically change lanes, handle forks and take 
high curvature exits to follow a nav route.
 
Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn the 
signal, before th
e car moves into an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow 
customers to wave the confirmation requirement they choose to. One area 
that I'm personally really excited to build on this improvement is active 
safety. With the advancement in neural networks,
 
covering 360 degrees of 
view around our car, we can provide a level of constant vigilance that 
humans just can't.
 
Ultimately, this shall allow us to warn, even intervene for an enormous 
percentage of modern accidents and to ship these improvements as soft
ware 
upgrades to our existing customers.
 
Elon Musk
 
We have a lot of 
-
 
we see this all the time in the data where the cloud will do 
an automatic breaking event and save a pedestrian or another car from 
impact. This happens all the time.
 
Stuart Bowers
 
All th
e time.
 
Elon Musk
 

 
Stuart Bowers
 
Yeah, the team has done an incredible work here and by bringing up more of 
the cameras around the car we can detect things as they come toward us, 
not just 
directly in front of us.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Stuart Bowers
 
Pete?
 
Peter Bannon
 
Hi, this is Pete Bannon. The Hardware 3 design is continuing to move along. 
Over the last quarter, we've completed qualification of the silicon, 
qualification of the board. We starte
d the manufacturing line, in qualification 
of the manufacturing line. We've been validating the provisioning flows in 
the factor. We built test versions of Model S, X and 3 in the factory to 
validate all the fit and finish of the parts and all the provisio
ning flows.
 
So we still have a lot of work to do. And the team is doing a great job, and 
we're still on track to have it ready to go by the end of Q1.
 
Elon Musk
 
Great. And that will be on it roughly 1000% increase in processing capability 
compared to the c
urrent hardware. And so, it's obviously giant improvement 
despite being a 
-
 
it costs about the same. Cost, volume and power 
consumption are approximately the same as the current hardware, but it's a 
ten
-
fold improvement in frames per second.
 
Peter Bannon
 
T
hat's right.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, and improved redundancy as well. But very importantly 
-
 
it's very 
important emphasize is that the only thing that needs to change between a 
car that's produced today and a car, let's say, produced in the two second 
quarter of n
ext year is swapping out the Autopilot computer. And this is a 
simple change that takes less than half
-
an
-
hour in service to upgrade the 
computer. And so, anyone will be able to upgrade their computer to full self
-
driving capability or upgrade their car to
 
full self
-
driving capability with a 
simple service visit.
 
So we expect all cars with a Hardware 2 sensor suite, basically anything 
made in the last roughly two years will be upgradeable to full self
-
driving.
 
Peter Bannon
 
Yeah. In fact, a lot of the cars w
e're using for testing today have in fact been 
upgraded from Hardware 2.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right, so it's very important to emphasize, like people shouldn't 
-
 
but 5% 
people who would want to wait until that comes out. But there is no need to 
wait till it comes out
, because it's just a very simple plug
-
and
-
play change to 
get to the full self
-
driving. And anyone who is compatible with self
-
driving 
option will just get it done for free. And anyone who still wants to order full 
self
-
driving at this point, it's just an 
off menu item, you can still order it.
 
But the 
-
 
we took it off the order menu, just because there are 
-
 
it was really 
creating a lot of friction in the sales process and people didn't understand 
the difference between Enhanced Autopilot and full self
-
driv
ing. So just to 
simply the order process, we took that off. But anyone who asks for it can 
certainly get it. And it really ends up being a discount of future capability.
 
But to be clear, there is definitely no need to wait until Q2 to order a car. It's 
-
 
w
e want to make it just completely seamless process, so there is no 

 
Andrej Karpathy
 
Yeah, certainly. Hi, everyone. My name is Andrej Karpathy. I'm the director 
of AI here at Tesla. And my team trains
 
all of the neural networks that 
analyze the images streaming in from all the cameras for the Autopilot. For 
example, these neural networks identify cars, lane lines, traffic signs and so 
on. The team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for th
e 
Autopilot computer which Pete briefly talked about.
 
This upgrade allows us to not just run the current neural networks faster, 
but more importantly, it will allow us to deploy much larger, computationally 
more expensive networks to the fleet. The reason 
this is important is that, it 
is a common finding in the industry and that we see this as well, is that as 
you make the networks bigger by adding more neurons, the accuracy of all 
their predictions increases with the added capacity.
 
So in other words, we a
re currently at a place where we trained large neural 
networks that work very well, but we are not able to deploy them to the 
fleet due to computational constraints. So, all of this will change with the 
next iteration of the hardware. And it's a massive st
ep improvement in the 
compute capability. And the team is incredibly excited to get these networks 
out there.
 
Elon Musk
 
Great, thank you. Again 
-
 
actually I've said this before, what I think 
-
 
just 
talking a bit about the kind of long
-
term future, we absol
utely see the future 
as kind of 
-
 
as sort of a shared electric autonomy. So that you'll be able to 
do ride
-
hailing or share your car anyway, sort of long
-
term model that's 
some combination of like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. There will be Tesla 
dedicated cars f
or ride
-
hailing and there will be 
-
 
and any customer will be 
able to share their car at will, just like you share your house in Airbnb. So 
it's a combination of those two models. I think, it's pretty obviously where 
things are headed long
-
term.
 
The 
advantage that Tesla will have is that we will have millions of cars in the 
field with full autonomy capability, and no one else will have that. So I think 
that puts us 
-
 
that will end up putting us in the strongest competitive 
position long
-
term.
 
And then
, Laurie, can you finished off with a talk about factory safety, and 
thank you for the hard work of you and your team. I think we made great 
strides. And yeah, please, please, go ahead.
 
Laurie Shelby
 
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, we have the safest cars made by the 
safest people. So 
it's exciting time here at Tesla. All car and manufacturing factories have 
injuries. At Tesla, we have a commitment to zero injuries. And our target is 
actually on good reporting. So we have good reporting of injuries, good 
reporting of n
ear
-
misses, good observations and lots of improvements. So to 
be the safest company in the world, we have to be committed to that, and 
everybody here is. So we are actually steadily getting there. And we're not 
going to stop till we're there.
 
Elon Musk
 
Abs
olutely. Yeah, so many were mentioning like for example, like we had 
like some sort of, for example, like we do get this like quite unfair 
acquisitions, for example one of them was like that we were underreporting 
injuries. And it's worth nothing that OSHA
 
completed their investigation and 
concluded that we have not been doing anything of the sort.
 
Laurie Shelby
 
Correct, correct. The factory here had a 4
-
month
-
long Cal
-
OSHA 
investigation. And it basically proves that we are recording properly and 
doing as w
e should be. So it's much different than what you would read 
about in the press.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Those are true.
 
Laurie Shelby
 
Yeah. I'm very proud of the team for that. It's 
-
 
one point I think people 
don't know is, I've been here about a year now, time f
lies and you're having 
so much fun.
 
Elon Musk
 
It's like five years.
 
Laurie Shelby
 
I know. But when I joined we were already, really a fraction, our injury rate 
was a fraction of what it has been when Toyota and GM ran the factory in 
the early day. So what 
we're all about is really continuing to make 
improvements from there. And what's also important is not to have serious 
injuries. And that's extremely rare here at Tesla. We have really strong focus 
on prevention, and also using mitigating controls, so thes
e types of injuries 
don't occur. I mean, most of the injuries that we have are muscular sprains 
and things like that.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. It's essentially it's a muscle sprain and getting scratched. That's the 
most that we're seeing.
 
Laurie Shelby
 
Exactly. Yeah
, and then finger cuts and sprains, so I kind of just want to 
break down a few things that my team is been working on along with all the 
leaders here. First is people and engagement. So one of the first things is 
meeting with you, Elon, meet with you on a 
regular basis. We meet with all 
the production leaders. So it's full
-
on engagement on improving safety. We 
have built a really strong EHS team, the best and the brightest.
 
We have 
-
 
and our EHS team is actually embedded into the line on the 
factory, becaus
e we learn the process and we learn the people. You don't 
know how to improve unless you're out there on the line, on the process, 
engaging with the associates, listening and learning from our associates. So 
we have really strong engagement, health and saf
ety committees. We do 
find
-
it
-
fix
-
it walks or walker or leaders are out there walking and also 
looking for improvements. And actually just this quarter, we had over 
15,000 improvements. I mean, that's like amazing, so very, very exciting 
about that.
 
We als
o look at risk reduction in human performance. People are going to 
make mistakes, so we're going to design until we sail safely. We have an 
early symptom intervention program, this is where we have industrial 
athletes go out on the line and work with our a
ssociates, before anything 
happens, like if you have a pain, let's work it out, let's strengthen and really 
get our employees fit, so good doing that.
 
We've also just opened a new and improved health clinic, so when injuries 
do occur we get the absolute be
st care for our associates. And it's actually 
overseen by one of California's leading orthopedic surgeons. And we did 
that, because most of our injuries, like we said like 80%, 85% are those 
sprains and strains. So now they get that best care here on site.
 
And we 
have 24/7 care. We are actually staffed by three full
-
time doctors and 
nurses. And I am really super happy with the care they're giving, and I think 
the employees are as well.
 

 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, we're going to expand on that. So, yeah, 
the Tesla sort of health clinic 
both at Fremont and at Giga, so we have a really immediate first
-
class 
healthcare available right on the spot, when people need it. And this not just 
for workplace, this for workplace and non
-
workplace.
 
Laurie Shelby
 
I know 

 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. If anything goes, if you like become injured right off for any reason 
then there is healthcare immediately on site.
 
Laurie Shelby
 
That's where we plan to give, exactly. And then finally, just being 
proactive, 
because that's what we're about, innovation and proactive. I mean, we 
joined National Safety Organization. We partner with many leading 
universities, including California Berkeley, Center for Occupational & 
Environmental Health. We do presentati
ons there. We work with the 
automotive industry, and do benchmarking all of the time. We're always 
looking and bringing people in to look for things that we can do better, and 
for new technology and innovations in safety.
 
And with all of that, we have made
 
improvements in our injury rate. We are 
more than 10% better year
-
over
-
year in our lost work days and our days 
away. But the most important thing is we're also getting all those good 
engagement observations. They're moving up, so injury down, observations
 
engagement up.
 
Elon Musk
 
All right, listen. Thanks, Laurie.
 
Laurie Shelby
 
Thank you.
 
Elon Musk
 
Thanks, Laurie. And we'll provide further updates on workplace safety. And 
our goal is unequivocally to have the safest factories in the world, where 
people will look forward to coming to work in the morning. So it's like, yeah, 
that's our goal. All right, with that, we can move to questions.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Cool. Well, thank you very much. Sherry, let's go to the first question, 
please.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answ
er Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.
 
Dan Galves
 
Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the quarter. It's 
really amazing to see this landmark quarter after covering the company for 
so 
long. And thanks for bringing some of your team on to the call. It's very 
interesting. My question is about cell supply. There has been some noise 
about tight cell supply in Sparks and tight labor supply. In the short term, 
could you just talk about whethe
r demand is outpacing supply of battery 
cells and kind of what's your plan for long
-
term expansion, including cell 
supply in China?
 
Elon Musk
 
JB, do you want to take it?
 
JB Straubel
 
Sure. I can speak to that. This is JB. We have had a period, where the 
sup
ply was fairly tight for Model 3, but it did not really constrain the Model 3 
production in any significant way.
 
Elon Musk
 
Less than a week.
 
JB Straubel
 
Yeah, maybe for a few days. The impact was largely felt on the energy 
products. And that's still is som
ewhat tight. But we do, as we've pointed out 
in previous discussions, we do have third
-
party supplies of energy cells. So 
that production can continue even independently of the Panasonic supply in 
Sparks. So that's been very helpful. And that is expanding 
in future 
quarters. And also, the Panasonic supply is expanding, the productivity of 
existing lines is continuing to improve, with a lot of hard work from the 
engineering teams and just operational stability.
 
And we continue to bring online new production 
lines. So even just in the 
last several weeks, we've started up yet another cell production line with 
Panasonic and through the end of the year, there's another line coming on, 
and then one shortly after that. So there is a steady increase in the total 
sup
ply. That should keep us ahead of even Model 3 growth and also should 
let us have a larger percentage of energy supply be sourced from Giga 
locally.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. We are making a pretty nutty amount of the world's lithium
-
ion 

wondering like, I think we're at a 60% or something?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah. So at the moment, if you look at, for example, for Q3, all electric 
vehicles made around the world, their total battery capacity was about 20 or 
19 gigawatt hours. And what we produced
 
in Q3 was about the same or a 
little bit higher, so about half of world's batteries basically.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, and that's 
-
 
because we also sourced cells from Japan and elsewhere. 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
So 
-
 
yeah, so j
ust the Giga itself is about 20 and on top of that S and X is 
-
 
I 
don't know, another 4 or 5.
 
Dan Galves
 
Got it. No, it's a huge advantage. Are there plans that you can talk about for 
cell supply in China? Will that be produced in China? I'm assuming so.
 
E
lon Musk
 
Long
-
term, it will be produced in China. Short
-
term, we're not certain of the 
short
-
term situation, but long
-
term certainly.
 
Dan Galves
 
Got it, okay. Thanks very much.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank 
you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street 
Research.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Hey, thank you for taking my questions. I was very surprised in the numbers 
you reported today by 
-
 
that your gross margin performance on the Model 3. 
So if I remembe
r correctly, you were expecting more like a 15% type of 
margin for this quarter, and you actually did better than 20%. So can you 
take us through what's improved like faster and better than you had initially 
anticipated in the manufacturing line, and where
 
these improvements came 
from?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Deepak here, and Jerome and others please feel free to join. Our 
improvements on the cost side were in every aspect of cost. So clearly, our 
manufacturing labor hours improved significantly 
-
 
our overall manufact
uring 
costs dropped almost 30% sequentially Q2 to Q3. We produced more 
volumes, so we had better fixed cost absorption. We have far less scrap. Our 
yield on each of the lines across both factories improved significantly.
 
And as we look forward, we see even
 
more opportunities. We are going 
through this phase, where we are now stabilizing production and the team 
can now intensely focus on cost optimization. And that trend will just 
continue in Q4.
 
Elon Musk
 

-
 
on the conserv
ative side when we 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Right. Our expectation was we will do better, but we wanted to be 
conservative. You're right, in terms of our guidance that we gave for Q3. 
Yeah.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Okay. Thanks. Tha
t's great. And then on the 
-
 
as a quick follow
-
up, you've 
announced over the weekend like a mid
-
range car with a smaller battery 
pack. And I was wondering, as you're looking at expanding, for example, the 
Model 3, I think about it as you have two options, 
one was to go abroad and 
to keep what you are seeing higher end, higher ASP car, and the other one 
was to go for lower cost car and stick to the U.S.
 
So how did you decide the sequencing of these two things? Why is lower car 
now and going abroad only 
early next year?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we are trying to provide most affordable electric car options that we 
can. And since we just don't have the ability to get to the $35,000 car right 
away, we thought this might be a way to offer it as an intermediate step. 
A
nd that's really it.
 
We expect to start producing a significant volume for Europe in January. And 
obviously take some time to ship, so deliveries 
-
 
probably pretty significant 
deliveries in Europe kind of in the late February, March timeframe, because 
the 
cars have to get all the way from California to a customer in Europe. And 
for us, the car is only counted as delivered if it reaches the end customer 
and all the paperwork is completed correctly. So it's the highest possible 
standard for considering a sale
 
a sale. Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
[Indiscernible] that you start delivering cars.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. We may or may not deliver cars in APAC in Q1, but certainly in Q2. It 
will be kind of borderline as whether a car is delivered in APAC by the end of 
Q1. So I can't 
say it for certain. Definitely in Europe, but 
-
 
and then 
definitely in APAC in Q2.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.
 
Romit Shah
 
Yes, thank you. I gue
ss, just along those lines, you indicated that you're 
going to bring Model 3 to Europe early next year. Where would you like to 
see production in order to support that ramp overseas?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, initially production will occur. I mean, at least the las
t, it takes several 
months, our production is 
-
 
vehicle production will take place at our car plant 
in California.
 
Romit Shah
 
Sorry, I meant to ask, where would you like to see the production rate on a 
weekly basis go to, in order to support that ramp?
 
Elo
n Musk
 
It's hard to predict with accuracy. The 
-
 
and there is also, like with all the 

about like next quarter, so like what is
-
 
likely global demand for Model 3. It's 
probably i
n the order of anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million cars a year, 
let's say, quick global demand for Model 3.
 
If we're talking like, they have the 3 series, that's around 0.5 million. The 
BMW 3 series is about 0.5 million units a year globally. And generally,
 
we 
find that we outcompete the BMW 3 series quite well. So it seems like logical 
therefore that we will long
-
term have a higher production 
-
 
higher demand. 
Maybe it's somewhere between the kind of the BMW 3 series and the 
Volkswagen Golf, which about a 1 
million units a year. So, yeah, that's 
anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million units a year long term.
 
Romit Shah
 
And you have to add new lines to support that or are you just going to 
continue to remove bottlenecks in the existing lines?
 
Elon Musk
 
We're defini
tely going to do local production in China. We're moving rapidly 
on that. So we're driving to have Model 3 production for the China market or 
the Greater China market active certainly next year. It will be happening 
next year. But it will be done in with 
-
 
in a very capital efficient manner, 
much more akin to the way we did general assembly line 4 versus general 
assembly line 3. And then, we'll also have a factory in 
-
 
and in Europe long
-
term, because it's pretty silly to make cars in California and ship th
em all the 
way to Europe, that's far.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Especially, in high volumes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Exactly, especially if it's a 
-
 
I'm not talking about the S and X. I'm just 
talking about the 3. So S and X will continue to be made in California. I 
think 
probably exquisitely here. For cars we're trying to maximize the portability 
and it makes a lot of sense to produce those cars at least in the continent 
where they are consumed or bought.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Ope
rator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from George Galliers with Evercore.
 
George Galliers
 
Thank you. Maybe just following up on the previous question, is the target 
still to produce 10,000 Model 3s a week in Fremont. And I think you 
mentioned in the 
past, that once you got to a run rate of around 5,000, 
you'd be better placed to assess what CapEx is required to get there. So as 
of today, do you have a better idea of what CapEx is required to get to that 
kind of level at Fremont?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think we'r
e not prepared to speak to that right now, except that it will be 
considerably less than money that we spent to get 5,000 in the first place, 
like quite 
-
 
I think quite dramatically less, so like I probably see a path like 
7,000 units for Model 3 with real
ly minimal CapEx.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
Very minimal.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, Jerome, yeah, it's very minimal to get to 7,000 a week. And then, I 
mean, that's really just basically solving 
-
 
improving the uptime of the 
existing lines and we can do 7,000 a week.
 
Jerome Gu
illen
 
Exactly.
 
Elon Musk
 
Exactly, yeah. So and then it gets a little harder as you start to go above 
7,000. We would need 
-
 
at least bring the lines down in Fremont for 
significant upgrades to get to 10K. But also it's just not 
-
 
we're not talking 
about ma
ssive amounts of CapEx. But I would say like long term, it's 
-
 
again 
long
-
term it's 
-
 
predicting these in a quarter
-
by
-
quarter basis is very 
difficult, because when you have an exponential growth rate like we do. I 
mean, if you look at Tesla cumulative del
iveries over time, that's like the 
cleanest exponential curve that I've ever seen.
 
But small movements in calendar time can look like a very large hit or miss, 
or way or the other, because it's such steep curve. That's why I am 
-
 
it's 
always tricky to pred
ict things on a quarterly basis. But a lot easier if you go 
out a year or so. Yeah, I mean, probably long
-
term it's, as we sort of 7,000 
to 10,000 cars from Fremont of Model 3, and then, I don't know 5,000 to 
8,000 in the rest of world, something like that
. This is a guess.
 
George Galliers
 
Okay. Thank you. And then, just as a follow
-
up, in the letter, you do point 
out the size of the European market for premium mid
-
sized sedans is 
roughly twice that of the U.S. Could you also maybe just comment to what 
your
 
expectations of the mix in Europe? Based off Model S and Model X, do 
you expect a richer mix in Europe versus the U.S. or is it fairly similar?
 
Elon Musk
 
We've given that zero thought. I mean, this is like 
-
 
this is not, I've not 
-
 
I 
don't know, Martin, y

 
Martin Viecha
 
All I'm aware of is that, because of cold weather and probably all
-
wheel 
drive and long battery range will be highly demanded in Europe. But apart 
from that, I mean, we ultimately have to start selling the car to see what the
 

 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I mean, it seems like, it's likely to be comparable to 
-
 
I think it's 
-
 
it's 
pretty, I mean, that market is like twice big in Europe. And, well, there's 
likely to be at least as much demand in Europe than there is in the mos
t 
market. Like that's a pretty safe bet. But our goal really is to make electric 
cars that everyone could forward, not to sort of line hot 
-
 
high option value 
cars. It's like if we can produce the $35,000 car today, we would do it. We 
need more work, there
 
is more work to do before we can make $35,000 car, 
and have it be positive gross margin. We're probably less than six months 
from that, but that's our mission.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. 
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Maynard 
Um with Macquarie.
 
Maynard Um
 
Hi, thank you. Congratulations on a great turning point for Tesla. As you 
continue to scale the business, can you talk about how we should think 
about how you balanc
e profits versus reinvestments? You are targeting 
sustainable GAAP profitability and cash flow. But I'm curious, if there's a 
level of GAAP profitability or GAAP operating margin or cash flow you want 
to hold and then take the excess to fund new growth or 
accelerate 
opportunities?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. I mean, maybe you could 
-
 
if we'd characterize that question it will be 
like, are we starving new vehicle development in order to achieve GAAP 
profitability and cash flow positive, would that be an accurate? Is tha
t 
essentially 
-
 
like the answer is no. So we've made significant progress on the 
Model Y. So in fact, I approved the prototype to into production recently. We 
saw 
-
 
it will be 2020 before that's in volume production. But we made great 
progress there. We al
so continue to make progress on the semi and the new 
Tesla Roadster. And then, actually probably some 
-
 
firstly, most excited 
about is the Tesla pickup truck. It's like 
-
 
I think it's going to reach the next 
level stuff there.
 
And then also 
-
 
I should not 
forget to mention, the solar tile roof will also 
start getting into volume production of the solar tile roof next year. That's 
quite a long development cycle, because anything that's roof is going to last 
30 years. So even if you do accelerate life testing
 
as fast as possible, there's 
still a minimum amount of time to do that. And there's a lot of engineering 
that goes into how do you put on the solar tile roof, but with 
-
 
and not be 
really labor intensive in doing so. So there's a lot of engineering not ju
st in 
the tile, but in the way it's done. And then, we've got to continue to 
improving some Powerwall, Powerpack, other energy products. I think, 
we've got the most exciting product roadmap of any company by far. I'm not 
even sure like probably twice 
-
 
I d
on't even know who would have 
-
 
which 
company would have a better product roadmap or even close, yeah. Maybe 
they do, but I don't know about them.
 
Maynard Um
 
Great. And when you think about Tesla having its own ride
-
sharing fleet or 
giving people the abili
ty to loan out their car like an Airbnb model, I'm 
curious if your long
-
term plan is to build a platform that's going to enable 
companies to write applications to turn the car directly into an application. 
And then can you also maybe just talk about that b
usiness model? Is that 
-
 
should we be thinking more about like a revenue
-
sharing model sort of like 
how Apple takes a piece of revenue generated for applications from iPhones? 
Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
I don't know turning the car into an application exactly. But 
I mean, maybe 
trying to do things that maximizes usefulness, and so if there's a way to 
think, where third
-
parties can do something and that could make sense. But 
I do know, for sure that Tesla will operate its own ride
-
hailing service will 
compete directl
y with Uber and Lyft obviously.
 
And 
-
 
but then also have the ability for customers to offer their car and add 
or subtract their car to the fleet at will. It will be a company owned fleet 
-
 
and the company
-
owned fleet with just be aware that aren't enough 
c
ustomer cars to be life out. So if we find like a particular metro, there aren't 
enough customers who are going to add their car to the shared fleet. And 
then, that's where we'll start rum them with a Tesla fleet. So that's why it's 
a certain combination o
f Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. And then we charge 
something probably comparable to, yeah, you have to say [Asterworks] [ph] 
or I don't know we tried 30% or something, in order for somebody to add 
the car to the fleet.
 
I think that's like a pretty sensible way to
 
go.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Thanks, everyone. First question is on governance, as the company conducts 
its search for a new Chai
rman, what are the attributes, experiences of that 
person that you think would be a best shared or best value for Tesla?
 
Elon Musk
 

 
Adam Jonas
 
No problem. Yes, I do. Can you tel
l us about the folks who are taking 
deliveries of Model 3. What are the top cars, car models or brands they're 
trading and switching out how many are new to the brand? That kind of 
anything you are prepared to share and then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Elon Musk
 
Y
eah, absolutely.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Hey, this is Martin. So I've done the analysis of all the trade
-
ins that we've 
received. And really the only pattern that are seeing is that, it sort of all 
across the boards and the vast majorities non
-
premium brands. I thin
k that 
is the number one message, it's just more than half of the trade
-
ins we've 
received were priced that below $35,000 when new.
 
But other than that there's no real pattern. I haven't noticed anything worth 
highlighting other than it's just a lot of peo
ple upgrading their cars, quite 
dramatically.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
This is a huge upgrade.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. For most 
-
 
for many people it is the most expensive car they've ever 
bought. So they are clearly demonstrating what the money that they we're 
willing to 
spend extra money to get a Tesla. So like the sense like mass
-
market premium.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And the price log is way beyond the back spread. It's clearly the value for 
the car, that they're perceiving, whether it's cost of ownership, whether it's 
sustainabi

 
Elon Musk
 
Safety.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

up significantly in the purchase products.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I mean, really like I honestly feel like the top reason to r
efer a friend 
by Tesla is just going to keep your friend safe.
 
Adam Jonas
 
That's a good reason. If I can just squeeze in since I couldn't ask the first 
one that you could answer, do you think that the third quarter is a 
milestone, Elon, where you think Tes
la becomes sustainably self
-
funding, 
and perhaps not in need of outside capital? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. That is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt. At least 
that's our intention right now, that may change in the future. But the current 
ope
rating plan is to pay off our debts not to refinance them, but pay them 
off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage of the company. But I 
actually almost forgot one quite important thing. As 
-
 
and this is quite 
helpful, it's always helpful to have th
ese sort of crisis situations with 
logistics, for example.
 
As I dug into the inventory like basically finished product inventory from 
factory to the customer, I was quite surprise to see how long that took that 
took, and that it was quite expensive in a lo
t of cases to get cars to 
customers. This was something I didn't fully appreciate before. And we really 
have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from the exiting the 
factory to receiving the check from the customer, being in the customers 
h
and, if we can only get the check when we give the car to the customer. So 
getting car from factory to customer to get that to as short as possible.
 
In August, the average time in North America to get a car from the factory 
to a customer was 30 days, which
 
is embarrassingly long. By the end of the 
quarter, we've reduced it to around 20 days. And our goal in Q4 
-
 
this is a 
goal, not a promise. But our goal is to get the average time of the car from 
factory to customer under 10 days. This is a giant improveme
nt in the 
capital efficiency of the company, because we're making on the order of $75 
million worth of products per day 
-
 
of cars per day. So every day, it required 
$75,000 
-
 
$75 million with capital, so every 10 days, it's $750 million.
 
And we 
-
 
obviously
, we have a loan from the bank that we can make use of. 
But the banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle, which 
translates to about 70% of the price of the vehicle. So 
-
 
and then we've got 
this loan outstanding, which effectively increases th
e COGS of the car. And it 
dilutes the company to the tune of 30% of one of the inventory 
-
 
of the 
finished goods in transit it.
 
So that this is really like tightening that and getting that below 10 days in 
North America and then also improving dramatically
 
the time 
-
 
the transit 
time to Europe and Asia. It is where like having local factories is actually 
very important for capital efficiency of the overall system. Because, I think, 
over time, we want to get the time from a car going from a factory to 
custom
er under 7 days worldwide. And then, the terms that we have with 
from our suppliers are, on average, just over 60 days.
 
Now, our product inventory management also there's a lot of room for 
improvement there. We think we can probably cut that down to a few 
$100 
million or so, Deepak, something like that, maybe $200 million or $300 
million of COGS at the factory. So effectively, what we're going to go is 
reverse the working capital requirement for the company quite dramatically, 
so to a point where the faster
 
we grow the more capital we have. This is 
incredibly important for capital efficiency of the company. It's night and day.
 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
No. I think, you are totally 
-
 
we are reducing the raw material inventory o
n 
one hand by keeping production stable, finding efficiencies and warehouse 
management and the supply chain. And at the same time, reducing the time 
to deliver the car and convert that car into a cash. And that significantly 
improves working capital needs.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, it's really quite dramatic. So, yeah, I think it sure profoundly changes 
the financial effectiveness of Tesla.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah, we reduced our inventory in Q3, which helped. And then, although we 
had higher payables because 
-
 
sorry, high
er receivables, because the 
quarter end, the weekend, we won't have that in Q4, so all of this should 
continue to help us in Q4 and beyond, the working capital again.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I mean, it occurs to me that, even if the only thing 
-
 
like even if 
this 
was the only thing that Tesla did different was to shorten the time from 
factory to end customer. In any given company that would outcompete all of 
the companies over time. It would not be a contest.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Thank you very much. Let's go 
for the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes, thank you. I have one for Deepak and then a follow
-
up please. Deepak, 
the OpEx expense management was very strong in the qu
arter. I think was 
down 13% sequentially and OpEx was only up 5% year
-
over
-
year despite 
revenue growing 71%. So on that front, I mean, in hindsight did you get too 
bloated and needed to get more rightsized? And looking forward, how do we 
think about OpEx g
rowth versus revenue growth on kind of a more 
normalized basis?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah, Toni, so excluding one
-
time items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 
5% to just clarify that first of all. And a lot of that was driven by the actions 
we took in Q2, to be more efficient with our employee headcount. We 
benefitted from that Q3. And w
e were really careful in terms of all of our 
spending.
 
The other piece that helped us is a lot of our Model 3 spending on expense 
sort of R&D is reducing, because Model 3 is going into production, so Q2 to 
Q3 we saw reduction there. And it just gives you t
he sense of the leverage 
of the expenses can have while the revenue was growing dramatically. So, 
our OpEx will increase in the future, but at a far slower rate and we will 
continue to be really, really careful about the spending.
 
And I think there are act
ually more efficiencies that we can find.
 
Elon Musk
 
We are going to find them, absolutely.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Right, so we will continue down this path.
 
Elon Musk
 
Definitely.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
And then to 
-
 
thank you for that. And then to follow up, I was just won
dering 
if you could help us a little bit on the back to the gross margin or Model 3 
and the $35,000 car. So this quarter, I impute that Model 3 ASPs were 
maybe $59,000 and that might suggest that gross margins on a $35,000 
Model 3 might be about zero.
 
And,
 
Elon, I think you alluded to the fact that the goal is really to get 
positive gross margins on a $35,000 car before shipping. Are those all fair 
assessments? And I guess the question is where is 
-
 
where would a Model 3, 
$35,000 Model 3 be in terms of gros
s margins today? And where does it 
need to be before you want to offer it broadly to consumers?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, I mean, it's 
-
 
the challenge with the 
-
 
asking questions of that nature 
and deal is that, it is a rapidly changing situation, so like literally 
if you 
would ask those in a month, it will be different to another month, it will be 
different. There is no question we need to get to a point where we can sell a 
$35,000 car and where the full accounted for COGS of the car is, let's say, 
on the order of $
35,000 or slightly less than $30,000.
 
Like I think we'd want to ideally get the COGS of the car 
-
 
of that 
configuration car under a 30,000. That would be 
-
 
that's our goal. That's 
what we're pushing very hard to achieve.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Exactly. And it's a ma
tter of time, it's a [Technical Difficulty] there is a 
significant material cost reduction that pumps the smaller battery packs, 
fewer amount of cells. It's not the same cells that we have in the existing 

 
Elon Musk
 
[What's an inter

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
It's the same amount of cells, so [fewer costs] [ph].
 
Elon Musk
 
Fewer cells and then non
-
cell portion of the pack, there also cost reduced. 
With the current mid
-
range pack it still has basically about 
the same non
-
cell 
portion of the packing cost.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And we're achieving massive reduction in all of our manufacturing costs per 
car, which will continue. And as volume grows that also helps us in the fixed 
cost absorption. So it's the same factors 
that has helped us so far, will 
continue to help us going forward to get us there.
 
Anything you want to add JB for that?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Great. Let's go to next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from James Albertin
e with Consumer 
Edge.
 
James Albertine
 
Great. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question and 
congratulations.
 
Elon Musk
 
Thanks.
 
James Albertine
 
I want to just point a clarification, Elon, you mentioned in August, the time 
to get the car from the fac
tory to a customer was 30 days, down to 20, at 
the end of the quarter your goal is under 10 by the end of 4Q. Where do we 
see that flow through from a COGS perspective? Is that an automotive gross 
margin or is that in services and other at this point?
 
Deep
ak Ahuja
 
It's all in automotive, gross margin and our logistics cost outbound. It's all in 
COGS, the automotive.
 
Elon Musk
 
Outbond logistics. Yeah, I think we'd see a reduction in inbound logistics as 
well as outbound logistics. Maybe your question is like
 
for the debt that is 
carried of that period of time, is that going to COGS, or is that not?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
The interest expense also that's in the interest expense line. That is not in 
COGS.
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay, yeah. That's why 
-
 
I do think like the 
-
 
the diffe
rence in COGS should 
probably broadened to include anything that's directly driven by volume, 
essentially that affects the marginal cost of the vehicle. So although that is 
not in 
-
 
officially in COGS, in my opinion, it probably should be. It's to take 
the
 
ABL interest expense and apply that effectively to the cost of the car.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And from a broader sense you're looking at it as the cost of doing business, 
which can be avoided.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Just, essentially, the cash flow ability increases quite dramatically. 
Dilution or leverage outside of the ABL line improves dramatically. And then 
the effective cost of the car also reduces, because you don't have the 
interest expense. If you have i
nterest expense over 20 days versus 10 days 
is a big difference.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah.
 
James Albertine
 
Understood, and I appreciate that clarification. Sort of just trying to get at, 
you've been running a negative gross margin in services and other for 
severa
l quarters now. And I wanted to get a sense for when that could 
maybe trough and starts to turn a corner and to generate some profit for 
you. I understand there's a lot of building out going on for sales, service and 
charging infrastructure. But if you cou
ld give us some kind of clarification 
there, that would be I think helpful.
 
And if you're willing maybe to provide an update on where you stand today 
in terms of battery costs, I know your goal, but sort of parity with ICE 
vehicles, but maybe an update if 
you're willing to provide and where you 
stand on that trajectory? Thanks.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think, over time, every quarter progressively we will see an improvement 
in the service and other business, as our revenue continues to grow, and the 
size for fleet gr
ows, as simple as that.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Long
-
term, I would expect service to be a significant revenue item, 
and to be a positive margin contributor, as it's going to be a function about 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And age.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, and it's essentially

 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Exactly. And if the car is under warranty now.
 
Elon Musk
 
Exactly, we're under warranty. Just like a lot of stuff is under warranty. But 
as the warranty expires, so there is like non
-
warranty items then we'd 
expect service to positive gross m
argin.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Okay. And that also includes our used car savings.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, a good point.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And our used car savings is continuing to grow and they have a healthy 
margin. And so, that overall business for mature companies is in some c
ases 
more profitable than new product sales. I'm not just talking about OEMs, car 
auto OEMs. And we are at the early stage of our growth here. And as our 
fleet size grows there are just so many opportunity in that business. That it's 
a matter of time, simp
ly said.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
James Albertine
 
Okay. And on the battery cost? There was a question there.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, that is a key sort of like competitive metrics. So I think it's safe to say, 
we're much better than anyone else by and large. But we 
prefer not to give 
a precise number.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. And now let's go to the last question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you our final question comes from Phil LeBeau with CMBC TV.
 
Phil LeBeau
 
Thank you, guys. Elon, a quick question, in terms of the federal tax credit 
starts to phased out as your sales cross over the threshold, what kind of an 
impact have you guys modeled into? How much that might slow down 
potential sales?
 
Elon Musk
 
We don't ex
pect this to result in 
-
 
I mean, yes, those are 
-
 
the sales tax or 
the tax incentive in the U.S. drops in half at the end of this quarter. But then 
we also start shipping to Europe and then start shipping to Asia. And we 
certainly do not expect anything th
at will cause productions drop below, let's 
say, a minimum of 5,000 cars a week.
 
Phil LeBeau
 
But in terms of in the United States, do you expect that it will slow down 
demand and sales within the U.S.?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think that as we're able to offer low cost
 
versions of the car, that we would 
expect demand to sustain in the U.S. I want to be clear, like it's not like 
we're holding back this lower cost version of the car intentionally. Just like 
that we said, is there anything we can do to provide lower cost c
ar now, and 
that's where we came up with depopulated long
-
range pack. It's just like 
basically taking 
-
 
having long range pack with fewer cells, like we really care 
about providing the end customer with the most affordable car that we could 
possibly produc
e, the best probability.
 
And if we could do the smaller pack now, we absolutely would. It's just going 
to take us, I don't know at least three months to get the production going. 
And then you got slower [ph] production. And that production is going to go 
t
o 
-
 
we got to make packs, packs got to go to the vehicle factory. The cars 
are going to have to get delivered to customers. So that's why customers 
will probably see the smaller battery pack on the order of like March or 
something or February maybe. It's s

 
Phil LeBeau
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Elon Musk
 
One thing 
-
 
at least, it did triggered kind of like maybe the points that I was 
bearing in mind. As our quarterly better indicates, the Model 3 has the 
-
 
is 
the most efficient energy per m
ile electric vehicle out there, because it's got 
the best efficiency. So we've got the best in terms of miles or kilometers per 
kilowatt hour. And we also have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour. This 
makes it very difficult for other companies to compete w
ith Tesla, because 
we own the most efficient car and the lowest cost of batteries.
 
So I do encourage our competitors to really make a huge investment. And 
we've been saying that for a long time. And then they're only in a 
competitive disadvantage because t
hey didn't 
-
 
we tried to help them as 
much as we could and they didn't want to take our help. So they can use all 
that patents for free. We were happy 
-
 
they can use our super charger 
network, if they 
-
 
and just have an adapter for our connector or somethi
ng.
 
We want to be as helpful as possible to the rest of the industry. The fact that 
matter is we made the investment in the Giga factory and other companies 
didn't. And we put a lot of effort into having extremely efficient cars which 
the other 
-
 
having mo
st efficient power
-
trains, and the other companies 
didn't. But sure, they will over time, but that's what has put us in quite a 
strong competitive position right now.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Fantastic, I think that's all we have time for today.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Just I w
ant to add a comment in closing.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Sorry, go for it.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And Elon started with it, and I wanted to say that from myself personally 
here. I want to personally thank all the Tesla employees that worked 
incredibly hard this quarter and 
then prior quarters in each and every part of 
our business.
 
Our results really are a reflection of the execution done in the company, 
done by the company, and the passion that our employees have to deliver 
such results despite all odds. And I also want to 
thank all our customers and 
all our investors who have believed in us, in our product, and our vision of 
accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. So thank you from 
myself.

5/9/14,Tesla,"Hi. Thank you for joining. First of all, I'd like to say we're incredibly proud of 
the Tesla team for producing 7,000 Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles in 
the last week of June. It was an amazing effort. It's an honor to work with 
such great team to 
produce that incredible result. It's like mind
-
blowing.
 
We continued to achieve 5,000 Model 3s per week, or 7,000 combined S, X 
and 3, multiple weeks in July, showing that, so we're able to do this on a 
sustained basis. And we expect to, in the absence of 
a force majeure or 
some very unexpected event, be able to achieve an average of 5,000 Model 
3s or above for Q3 and 2,000 Model S, Xs or above per week for Q3 as well. 
So essentially, 7,000 cars a week plus on average for Q3.
 
That's an amazing jump from onl
y a year ago. We were producing 2,000 
vehicles a week. It's really kind of a mind
-
blowing leap forward for a 
manufacturing company. So, yeah, just incredible work by the team to do 
that. Many, many late nights, weekends, extreme amounts of effort and lots 
of smart ideas. It's amazing.
 
One of the results you're seeing is that the Model 3 market share has 
surpassed all competitor premium midsized sedans combined. So, Model 3 
market share is now a majority, in July, it was a majority of all premium 
sedans. Tha
t trend is, we think, likely to continue. We do not think it will 
stop there.
 
I have Robin Ren here, who is our worldwide head of sales, to talk about 
some of the interesting elements that we're seeing in terms of cars that 
people are trading in, the sales
 
and demand trends, it's looking really 
positive.
 
We're also getting great feedback on Model 3 from our customers, and we're 
now delivering (04:13) Dual Motor and All
-
Wheel Drive versions and the 
Model 3 reviews are outstanding. Really couldn't ask for bet
ter reviews from 
some of the toughest critics in the world. And it's 

 
yeah. The thing that 
we're really finding is that the more Model 3s we deliver to the field, it's 
actually causing parallel growth of our sales. So, we deliver a Model 3 to 
somebody, th
ey love it, they tell all their friends, they're actually 

 
really, 
our customers are our primary sales force. They love their car and take their 
friends for a drive and that's the thing that fundamentally drives our sales.
 
But not everyone has a (04:59) M
odel 3 obviously, so we need to get the 
cars out there for test drives. As it is right now, not even all stores in North 
America have Model 3 for test drives. We prioritize getting cars to 
customers, but we're soon going to have Model 3s available for test
 
drives in 
all stores and both the performance version and the rear
-
wheel drive 
version.
 
So because a lot of people, they will not buy a car until they test drive it, 
which is not unreasonable. Although on Sunday when I delivered it, testing 
out like direc
t delivery, which I think is definitely the future, direct delivery 
from factory to customer's home or work or wherever they are, the guy who 
bought it had never actually even sat in a Model 3. I was like, wow, okay. I 
mean I said, well, how do you feel ab
out the car now that you have it and 
you've driven it? He's like I love it. It's amazing. So, yes. It seems to be 
really well
-
received.
 
Yeah. So, at a production rate of 7,000 cars a week, we believe we can be 
sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards. We're 
going to try to raise that rate 
of the Model 3 production steadily in the coming quarters and try to get to 
the 10,000 cars a week number as soon as we can. As we spent a lot of time 
debugging a wide range of manufacturing issues that the potential for our
 
existing lines to be able to produce far more cars is much greater than 
expected.
 
That by simplifying production lines, by speeding them up, by, in some 
cases, everything is being done manual instead of automatic, and in other 
cases, having be done automa
tic instead of manual, we've been able to 
achieve dramatic improvements to the output of existing lines, which means 
that our CapEx growing from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week is a 
tiny fraction of the CapEx needed to grow from 0 to 5,000 Model 3s
. This is, 
I think, very good news for capital efficiency of the company. And with 
(07:43), that it's going inform future mass market vehicles that we produce.
 
And from an operating plant standpoint, from Q3 onwards, I really want to 
emphasize our goal is 
to be profitable and cash
-
flow positive for every 
quarter, going forward. Now obviously, if there's a big recession or there's a 
severe force majeure event that interrupts the supply chain, that's not 
always possible, but we're confident that in, provided 
the economy is 
roughly where it is today or reasonably good and there's not a big force 
majeure event that we 

 
I feel comfortable achieving a GAAP income 
positive and cash flow positive quarter every quarter from here on out. 
That's a 

 
there may be occas
ional quarters, where we pay back a big loan 
or something, where there may be just because we paid back a big loan. But 
absent that, it would be cash flow positive.
 
So, once again, I want to thank the Tesla team for their incredible work and 
our customers 
for their support. Without the great people we have at Tesla 
and the customers who put their faith in us by buying our product, we would 
not be here today and, yeah, really never been more excited about the 
future of Tesla. We've got super exciting set of 
products to bring out in the 
future. And, yeah, I mean, sorry if I sound a little tired. I've been working 
like crazy in the body shop lately, but it's really going great, super excited. 
It's like, yeah, some good people.
 
And a number of the executive team
 
here. In particular I asked the three 
key leaders of the Tesla Autopilot team to be here. So, I think to go from 
here to see if Autopilot leaders of Tesla could introduce themselves and say 
a bit about what you're working on, what you're excited about in 
the future. 
Sorry if I put you guys on the spot or anything. I think we're making pretty 
radical advances in the core software technology and the division beyond 
that. And then very importantly with the Tesla self
-
driving chip technology 
that we've been wo
rking on for three years is finally coming to fruition. Pete 
Bannon is going to talk a lot about that. But it's a plug
-
in replacement for 
the existing computer and enables an order of magnitude improvements in 
operations per second or frames per second as 
a way to think about it.
 
And we think this is really the key to Tesla full vehicle autonomy. And like I 
said, designed to be really easy to replace. I'll let Pete talk about that. So, 
let me start off like Stuart, Andrej, and then Pete.
 
Stuart Bowers

Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay. Hi. I'm Stuart.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You need to talk louder by the way.
 
Stuart Bowers 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, we'll talk extra loud. So I'm Stuart. Yeah, joined the team relatively 
recently. Incredibly excited to kind of see the fou
ndation the team has built 
up until this point and we're building on top of that right now. So right now, 
a lot of the focus is on Autopilot v9, which is our sort of on
-
ramp to off
-
ramp 
solution that's going to automatically attempt to change lanes, unders
tand 
what lane the car is in, understand the route the user wants to travel and 
take that route for the user and ultimately hand back control to that user 
which is kind of stay in (11:50) control.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Integrated navigation. So, yo
u'd like (11:54) by the way, a little tip for if 
you're driving Model S or X or 3, is if you just tap the Navigate button and 
just drag down, it will automatically navigate you to your home or work, 
depending upon where you are. That's a pretty cool featur
e.
 
Stuart Bowers 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, yeah, that's part of the focus right now. We're also kind of digging in on 
some new safety features. I think probably the thing which is most exciting 
for me, coming from the team is just seeing the foundation that's been
 
built 
out over the last two years. I think Andrej will talk a lot about some of the 
perception and vision work we've done there with the data engine. That has 
sort of allowed us to build on top of that very, very quickly and I think we're 
all starting to 
see a new set of safety features that really only make sense in 
this world, we have extremely high understanding of what's happening 
around the vehicle.
 
So, I think when I start thinking about like what gets me excited when I 
come into work, it's like, one
, starting to introduce real aspects of kind of 
not just making the commute kind of reducing the drudgery or kind of the 
risk of commuting but also really (12:51) fun and the second is like 
dramatically improving safety in a way that you really can only do
 
once you 
have this very nuanced understanding of the world around you with 
perception.
 
Andrej Karpathy

Tesla, Inc.
 
Hello everyone. My name is Andrej Karpathy, and I'm the Director of AI here 
at Tesla. In particular, I lead the vision team which is respo
nsible for turning 
the video stream that we receive from all the cameras and the vehicle into 
an understanding of what is around us and around the vehicle. I worked with 
Neural Networks for about 10 years mostly as a (13:23). And what I'm really 
excited ab
out is really building out this infrastructure for computer vision 
that underlies all the neural network training, trying to get those networks to 
work extremely well, and make that a really good foundation on top of which 
we build out all the features of 
the Autopilot like the features associated with 
the v9 release that's going to come up and that Stuart as mentioned.
 
Peter Bannon

Tesla, Inc.
 
Hi. This is Pete Bannon. My team...
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
(13:49)
 
Peter Bannon 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
My team is leading currently the Hardware 3 development. The chips are up 
and working, and we have drop
-
in replacements for S, X and 3, all have 
been driven in the field. They support the current networks running today in 
the car at full frame rates with a
 
lot of idle cycles to spare. So, I think we're 
all really excited about what Andrej and his team will be able to do with this 
hardware in the future.
 
I think like one little anecdotal story was I gave a talk to his team on 
Hardware 3 last month explaining
 
how it worked and what it was capable of, 
and then afterwards, one of the researchers came up to me. He was really 
excited, and he said, this is so exciting. I'm really excited about exploiting 
this hardware and he said, I think people are going to want t
o come and 
work at Tesla, just to have access to this hardware and to try it out because 
it's so exciting. So as a hardware designer, having excited software 
developers is the best. And it's a really fun place to work because I do get to 
work with my two p
rimary customers, Stuart and Andrej, and making them 
happy is pretty fun.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, actually, Pete, maybe just 

 
some people know about your 
background, but not everyone does. So if you could just like 

 
Pete's a super 
humble guy,
 
but it would be great just to 

 
yeah. Talk about the stuff you've 
done before.
 
Peter Bannon 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Let's see. I started working designing computers at Digital Equipment 
Corporation in 1984, back when they were refrigerator
-
sized, and I've been 
work
ing on smaller and smaller designs ever since. I was a Intel Fellow 
working on a team for a little while, then I was VP of Architecture and 
Verification at PA Semi, which was acquired at Apple.
 
I led the design of the first ARM 32
-
bit processor that went i
nto the iPhone 
5. I built the team that designed the first ARM 64
-
bit processor in the world 
which went into the iPhone 5S. And then I worked on performance modeling 
and performance improvements at Apple for eight years. And then two years 
later, I came to
 
Tesla and designed the neural network accelerator that's 
part of Hardware 3 and helped architect the rest of the Hardware 3 solution 
that will be in the car next year.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it may be worth articulating some of the details, d
esign principles that 
explain why the Tesla AI chip, or AI computer, essentially, for the car is able 
to achieve an order of magnitude better processing than anything else that 
exists. Yeah.
 
Peter Bannon 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. So, like two years ago when I jo
ined Tesla, we did a survey of all of 
the solutions that were out there for running neural networks, including 
GPUs. We went and talked to other people like at ARM that were building 
embedded solutions for running neural networks. And pretty much 
everywher
e we looked, if somebody had a hammer, whether it was a CPU or 
a GPU or whatever, they were adding something to accelerate neural 
networks. But nobody was doing a bottoms
-
up design from scratch, which is 
what we elected to do.
 
We had the benefit of having 
the insight into seeing what Tesla's neural 
networks looked like back then and having projections of what they would 
look like into the future, and we were able to leverage all of that knowledge 
and our willingness to totally commit to that style of comput
ing to produce a 
design that's dramatically more efficient and has dramatically more 
performance than what you can buy today.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Cool. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, essentially the key is to be able to run the 
neural net at a fundamental
, at a bare metal level so that it's especially 
doing the calculations in the circuits itself and not in some sort of emulation 
mode which is how a GPU or a CPU would operate. So, you want to do 
basically a massive amount of localized matrix multiplication
 
with the 
memory right there.
 
So, it's a huge number of very simple complications with the memory 
needed to store the results of those complications right next to the circuits 
that are doing the matrix calculations. And the net effect is an order of 
magnit
ude improvement in the frames per second. Our current hardware, 
which 

 
I'm a big fan of NVIDIA, they do great stuff. But using a GPU, 
fundamentally it's an emulation mode, and then you also get choked on the 
bus. So, the transfer between the GPU and the C
PU ends up being one of the 
constraints of the system. So, the net effect is we're able to, with the Tesla 
computer 

 
and we've been like semi
-
stealth mode basically for the last two 
to three years on this, but I think it's probably time to let the cat out
 
of the 
bag because the cat's going to come out of the bag anyway.
 
But it's an incredible job by Pete and his team to create this, the world's 
most advanced computer designed specifically for autonomous operation. 
And as a rough sort of (18:58) whereas the
 
current NVIDIA's hardware can 
do 200 frames a second, this is able to do over 2,000 frames a second and 
with full redundancy and fail
-
over. So, it's an amazing design and we're 
going to be looking to increase the size of our chip team and our investment 
i
n that as quickly as possible. I think we have some of the best aces in the 
world, but I think we want to build on that even more.
 
And it costs the same as our current hardware and we anticipate that this 
would have to be replaced, this replacement, which 
is why we made it easy 
to switch out the computer, and that's all that needs to be done. If we take 
out one computer and plug in the next. That's it. All the connectors are 
compatible and you get an order of magnitude, more processing and you can 
run all t
he cameras at primary full resolution with the complex neural net. 
So it's super kick
-
ass. Thank you for doing that.
 
Peter Bannon

Tesla, Inc.
 
You're welcome.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
Thanks for making nets and thanks for making the software. Anyway,
 
basically I wanted to introduce three of the key people at Tesla that are 
doing this. I have huge respect and admiration for you guys and it's because 
of what you and your team's doing that Tesla will be successful in this arena. 
Thank you.
 
Martin Viecha

Thank you, Elon. Shiree, let's go to the first question.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question comes from Tony Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. I 
have one question and one follow
-
up, please. First, just on 
gross margins, it looks like S & X gross margins were up maybe 500 basis 
points sequentially and I'm wondering maybe you can articulate what drove 
that. And then, more importantly, it looks like y
ou're calling for Model 3 
gross margins to go from about maybe 3% this quarter to 15% next 
quarter. That's about a $6,000 cost out per car and I'm wondering if you can 
maybe help us understand what sort of the forces that drive that kind of 
improvement in 
a relatively short timeframe.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, absolutely. First of all, I'd like to apologize for being impolite on the 
prior call. Honestly, I think there's really no excuse for bad manners and I 
was violating my own rule in that regar
d. Certainly, I have some excuse. 
There are reasons for it in that I'd gotten no sleep and been working sort of 
110

hour weeks. But, nonetheless, there's still no excuse. My 
apologies for not being polite on the prior call.

And let's see. With respect to gross margin, I'll touch on that and then hand 
the rest to Deepak, but, certainly, when it's filling (22:11) up the production 
line,
 
there are a tremendous amount of inefficiencies. There's a lot of hurry 
up and wait, where some parts of the production line move well. Then, one 
part doesn't and you have associates waiting around with nothing to do.
 
There are parts that we thought were 
right but then it turns out that they 
weren't right. We got to send them back to the supplier. It's just like the 
whole sort of giant machine. It just needs to kind of lurch into a high pace 
and there's a lot of lurching, which is very inefficient. So, you
 
end up having 
super high labor costs per car and it just takes time to sort of spool up this 
giant machine. Basically a production system is like a giant cybernetic 
collector and it moves as fast as the slowest part. So, as we address those 
slow parts and
 
as we improve efficiency, then gross margin and so the 
profitability per car just improves dramatically. That's sort of at a high level. 
Deepak, do you want to add to that?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Elon, you described it extremely well. So just to sort 
of summarize, this was 
a major milestone for us in Q2 that the gross margin in Model 3 turned 
slightly positive and we feel really good about the path ahead. And as Elon 
said, it's driven predominantly by manufacturing cost efficiencies. The labor 
hours th
at we use to produce each car becomes less. The initial ramp
-
up 
costs that we have that are one
-
time, those inefficiencies disappear. Our 
fixed costs that are there that gets leveraged to a higher volume. So, all of 
that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Actu
ally, a thing that can also happen is that if it turns out, let's say, the 
production part was either designed wrong or built wrong or there's 
something wrong with it, then on camera, on (24:16) emergency basis, we 
have to go with low volume tooling which 
can be produced quickly. But a 
part produced off of low volume tooling can easily be 10 times more than a 
part produced off of production tooling. And so, sometimes where it gets 
really bad, if you've got a machine something out of a block and has either 
t
hat or going to make a car, then the cost of using low volume cost of use 
(24:45) of low volume tooling can be really nutty.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And the journey just continues as we stabil
ize and grow production from 
these levels we achieve even more efficiencies. And Q3 also benefits with 
somewhat improved mix as we're going to sell more All
-
Wheel Drive and 
performance cars and in the long run as we continue to achieve those 
efficiencies o
n cost, our gross margins will continue to increase.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I don't know if this trend will continue. We're trying to give you 
essentially all the information that at least we know of. But we're seeing 
roughly half of all custo
mers choose the Dual Motor or All
-
Wheel Drive 
option, which is actually quite a good positive surprise.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's been heartening to see the mix in terms of what customers want. 
Robin can probably add more to that.
 
Robin Ren 
-
 
T
esla, Inc.
 
Yeah. So, starting from end of June when we opened the configurator and 
invited existing reservation orders, we saw tremendous excitement and 
response from our customers. As Deepak just mentioned, we actually see 
more orders for the All
-
Wheel Dr
ive Dual Motor car and performance cars 
combined than the rear wheel drives.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, we don't want to say like this should be assumed to be a continued 
thing. It's just the thing we are seeing now. Yeah.
 
Robin Ren 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Correct. Another thing I want to point out is that we are actually 

 
since we 
opened the configurator to the general public in early July, we are seeing an 
increased demand coming from people who do not currently hold a 
reservation. I think that's somethin
g that we found super exciting, because 
these are the people who actually had no idea about Model 3 and they heard 
about Model 3 is available to order, many of them requested test drives and 
since early July, we have over 60,000 test drive requests in the 
U.S. alone 
and these people come into our stores, do the test drive, and they become 
super excited and they decide to order the car.
 
So, we believe that the strong demand coming from especially the non
-
reservation orders is going to dramatically increase a
s we increase our test 
drive population. To give you an example, three weeks ago, we had only 
eight stores having test drive cars to Elon's point earlier. Now we have over 
90 stores having test drive cars.

It's worth mentioning 

 
just an interesting little bits of information that 
Robin was telling me. I'd just like to also (27:34) Robin on doing a great job 
running worldwide sales. Nice to have you in this role and t
he awesome 
work done in China was really some next level stuff. Anyway, Robin was 
born and raised in Shanghai and has been 

 
along with Tom and Grace 
(27:55) and other members of our team in China has been sort of 
instrumental in establishing the China fac
tory and making sure that gets 
done right and having a great relationship with the government. And so it's 
nice work in that regard. It's really 

 
I think some of the things people don't 
expect like what are the top five trading cars for Model 3?
 
Robin Ren
 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, this is very interesting. So, we looked at what people who are buying 
Model 3 cars in the United States, what cars they are trading in. What we 
found is through this year, from January to July, the top five non
-
Tesla cars 
people are tr
ading in to get into a Model 3, they are Toyota Prius, BMW 3 
Series, Honda Accord, Honda Civic and Nissan Leaf.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Really surprising.
 
Robin Ren 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. They are surprising because they are not the traditional premium 
sedans. They are actually 

 
many of them are mainstream midsized sedans.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right. And we're obviously at this point not yet selling our $35,000 car, so 
this is promising for the future. All right. Cool. Next question?
 
Operator
 
T
hank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital 
Markets.
 
Joseph Spak

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. Maybe we could tackle some of the commentary 
about the Gigafactory coming in China. When you first announced the 
Gigafactory 1, I think you said that was going to be about a $5 billion 
investment, and you mentioned some volume numbers associated with what 
you think you could do in China. So we do some extrapolation, looks like 
maybe 15 gigawatt hours of initial capac
ity. I'm wondering if you could also 
do a linear extrapolation on the costs you think you need for that factory.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. And I would also like to apologize for being impolite on the last call 
with you. It's not right, and hope y
ou accept my apologies.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So with respect to Gigafactory CapEx, I think we learned a tremendous 
amount with Gigafactory 1, and we're confident that we can do the 
Gigafactory in China for a lot less. I think it's probably closer to 

 
this is just 
a guess, but probably closer to $2 billion, and that should be at a higher 

 
and that would be sort of at the 250,000 vehicle per year rate.
 
So I think we can be a lot more
 
efficient with CapEx, and that would include 
at least a factory module and pack production, body shop, paint shop and 
general assembly. Might even be less than that, but that's about the right 
number for that. And then cell production is something we're s
till figuring 
out with respect to the Shanghai factory.
 
JB, would you like to add to that?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I'd agree with all that. We found a surprising number of ways to 
improve efficiency and speed and density as well at Gigafact
ory 1, and all 
those lessons will absolutely be shared with Gigafactory 3. The teams are 
already of course beginning to collaborate and start to figure out ways to do 
this more efficiently and with less CapEx than last time. Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I think, we 

 
like less than half is like would be a good estimate. And 
maybe a lot less than half, but not more than half, would be a fair estimate 
for CapEx to get to that 250,000 level. So it's just 

 
we just learned a 
tremendous amoun
t about manufacturing, it's like 

 
it's definitely burned out 
a lot of neurons, yeah, mental scar tissue, it's like next level, but on the plus 
side we really know a lot about volume manufacturing at this point.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean, th
ere are so many specific examples, but even in just recent weeks 
and months, we found some 

 
certain areas of production that have been 
very capital intensive that we've been able to speed up with almost no 
additional CapEx by maybe 20%, even 25% or 30%.
 
E
lon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, kind of crazy. Including on the cell 

 
including the cell production.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, just by challenging some of the initial assumptions, the specifications, 
tweaking the controls and software.
 
El
on Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Look, what really matters, what actually doesn't matter, things we think 
matter, and some of it actually ends up not mattering at all.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And that's with basically zero CapEx.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tes
la, Inc.
 
Yeah. Yes.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So as you start to add very tactical, strategic CapEx to the existing lines, 
that's how we can get to something close to double or beyond with a really, 
really small increment.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, 
Inc.
 
Yeah, obviously one of the keys to success on the Model 3 production was 
the GA4 thing, which was led by Jerome. And General Assembly is key, and 
doing the sort of zone one, two, semiauto lines, which were critical because 
we had this fundamental fail
ure especially in zone one 

 
zone two of factory 
module production. Thank you, Jerome. It turns out Jerome was pulling 
some pretty incredible rabbits out of the hat. That was amazing.
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
An
d people make fun of (33:28) our tent, but by the way our tent is 
amazing and this is not like 

 
when people like say tent, they'll think it's like 
some sort of 

 
something made by REI to go camping. This is a tent that is 
actually commonly used as a perma
nent structure. It's a giant thing that is 
very commonly used as a permanent structure and we just had to come up 
with a creative solution because GA3 was not going to be able to make the 
rate and so we had to come up with some ideas, and tell people how t
hat all 
transpired. It's interesting, if you want to...
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, thank you. It was a fun project actually.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So not only was it producing good results, but a lot of peo
ple contributed 
from different engineering groups and had a lot of fun in the process. We set 
out...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(34:26) some of the people (34:28). It's cool. It's great. It is like (34:30) 
this is really satisfying about 
building a car.
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We just wanted to create an assembly line that would be very easy and very 
straightforward. So, it's a straight line. Very simple. Car enters at one point 
and it's finished at the other end. Very simple access o
n all sides. Very 
simple tooling that we reused for most of 

 
actually, nearly all of it is 
systems and tools that we discarded from previous SNX or for Model 3.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Especially Model 3. Like it was probably we had two weeks to sol
ve this 
problem, which is like quasi impossible. So, we actually didn't have time to 
order new equipment, because it would have taken too long to arrive. So, 
we took the conveyors that we'd discarded from the GA3 line, which didn't 
work or was way too comp
lex to actually do our products. (35:31)
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And we amplified, repurposed them, make them sturdy for what was 
needed. And...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, I think like the really cool idea was putting them on the 1% grade. So
 
it's like technically the conveyors for parts delivery to GA3 were not graded 
to be able to move something as heavy as a car, so we made it downhill and 
on a 1%
-
downward grade with the car at the top. So then, you can actually 
overcome the transport...
 
Je
rome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Gravity helped.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, gravity. So, basically, even on your slides, you can do 

 
accomplish a 
lot.
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's pushing the car.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly.
 
Jerom
e Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No. And something that I'm particularly happy about is that we installed the 
quality team at the end of the line and we wanted to have at least as high 
standards on this new line as in the other one, because it is so simple and 
stra
ightforward, they can run very quickly to any point in the line if there is 
any potential concern and address very quickly. There is no maze to move 
around or identify where something happened.
 
And the quality of the cars that come out of this structure is
 
at least as good 
and we make all the performance cars on this particular line and they seem 
to be doing quite well. So, this is a very pleasant surprise and the associates 
seems to be very happy and engaged in that particular area. So, this may be 
a model
 
of how we may want to start general assembly for future vehicles, 
at least start and we can always add further automation and complexity.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And something that's like somewhat counterintuitive is that this actually has 
fully con
sidered fewer labor hours per car than the GA3 system. And just to 
elaborate on what Jerome was saying, where we have parts delivery to GA4, 
the truck literally just backs up to the side of the line, where there is like a 
door in the tent. And then, that i
s used to unload parts from suppliers 
directly to where they are needed on the line.
 
So there's no intermediate assistant. Whereas for GA3, they're unloaded, 
they're put in a warehouse, then they're repackaged from the warehouse 
into these totes, which we 
actually have 220 people, something like that, 
across all shifts whose only job it was to repackage parts from the boxes 
that came in from suppliers to the boxes 

 
to these totes that go into the 
lifters that go up into GA3. That's literally all they do is
 
move things from 
one box to another box, and we don't need that at all on GA4.
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
All gone.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
All gone, yeah. And there's a tremendous amount of 24/7 robotics 
technicians that are constantly trying to 
make the machines have uptime. 
That's very expensive and that's where we figured like not having to 
maintain all these robotic systems, that's a big cost savings as well. And now 
we're going to be gradually adding simple automation into GA4 to make it 
easi
er to build a car and better sort of labor saving devices, but it's just 
fundamentally 

 
it's already at an efficiency level greater than GA3, which is 
pretty impressive.

Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. And appreciate all 
the color you've been providing, wanted to dig a little bit deeper, though
, in 
terms of capital spending plans. Considering your growth you've identified in 
China with the Model Y, we believe also in the EU, it's been discussed about 
a factory there. How do you plan to fund all of this growth without going 
back to the capital ma
rkets to raise funds? And can you verify for us whether 
or not there is a notice from a regulator that would prevent you from raising 
outside capital? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We do not 

 
we will not be raising any equity at any point, at leas
t that's 

 
I 
have no expectation of doing so, do not plan to do so. For China, I think, our 
default plan will be to use essentially a loan from the local banks in China 
and fund the Gigafactory in Shanghai with local debt, essentially. And we 
certainly cou
ld raise money, but I think we don't need to and we 

 
yeah, I 
think, it's better to 

 
it is better discipline not to.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, we're executing on an operating plan that keeps us sufficiently self
-
funded despite our CapEx needs and o
ur debts maturing, and still keep a 
very healthy balance on our balance sheet.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, our default plan is we pay 

 
we start paying off our debts. I don't 
mean refi
-
ing them, I mean paying them off. For example, there's a conver
t 
that's coming due soon, a couple hundred million, (42:13) $900 million, 
(41:28) something like that. We expect to pay that off with internally 
generated cash flow.

Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hey, everybody. First, there's so much love and respect for 
colleagues and 
Wall Street analysts on this call, it's almost 

 
it is lifting my spirits. What can 
I say? I got two questions. The first is for the Autopilot team. There's an 
argument that a fully autonomous car is essentially like a terminator that is 
pro
grammed to save lives in highly complex terrestrial environments and 
that this same technology with a few tweaks have some pretty obvious 
military capability. Do you see any risk that U.S. companies will ultimately 
not be allowed to operate weapons grade A
I
-
based technology in a market 
like China and vice versa?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, this has never come up. I wouldn't call it weapons grade. It's just like 
the car is trying to drive and if anything, the autonomous cars will be pretty 
easy to bu
lly because they'll be optimizing so much for avoiding collision. So 
that'll be more of a challenge than anything else is as soon as somebody 
sees that the car's autonomous, they know they can like cut them off and 
the car is going to do everything it can 
avoid a collision. So it's like that'll 
actually be probably a bigger challenge than anything else, but we've not 
encountered anything of the nature of what you're saying.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
So you don't see autonomous cars as a 
potential germination or training 
grounds for things that would have a national security or military interest? 
Okay. Maybe a follow
-
up, Elon, and my last question, who do you think 
would be a more formidable competitor over time, BMW or Amazon?
 
Elon Reeve 
Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
For Tesla?
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
For Tesla.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I don't think either of them are likely to be. As far as I know, I'm going to be 
pretty shocked if Amazon got into the car business, but I 
think BMW has 
great engineering. And it's good to see that they're making some 
investments in electrification. Hopefully, they do more of that. And I'm not 
sure where they stand on autonomy. It's not on our radar from an autonomy 
standpoint.
 
Adam Michael J

Thanks a lot.
 
Martin Viecha

Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay. Let's go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street 
Research.
 
Pierre C. Ferragu 
-
 
New Street Research LLP (US)
 
Thank 
you for having me on. So I wanted to make sure we understand well 
how you stop burning cash going forward, in coming quarters. And my 
understanding is that an important moving part here, probably the most 
important one is a positive impact of the ramp of t
he Model 3 on your 
working capital. And so I did some quick math on the quarter and I see your 
favorables increased by $430 million, while your risk level didn't move much 
which makes sense because you get paid on the spot and you pay your 
suppliers only o
n a 60 day notice or more. And so if I divide that by the 
number of incremental cars you've been producing in the quarter, I get to 
$23,000 per car.
 
And of course my question is whether this is a good way to think about it, 
which means that going forward w
hen we move into Q3 and Q4 every 
additional car, every additional Model 3 you're going to produce you're going 
to bump up payables by something in the region of $20,000 and that's going 
to be the main driver getting you to breakeven and to stop burning cas
h.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Deepak here. I mean, there are many factors. Clearly, the working capital 
benefit of the difference in the payable terms versus collecting cash is one of 
them. But also, it's our gross margin improvement on the business. With 
the 

 
it's the higher volumes and the higher gross margins, I'm thinking higher 
gross profit, I'm stating the obvious here on Model 3. Our SNX volumes are 
increasing too in the second half. That's going to help us significantly. And 
all of our other busine
sses are improving their profitability.
 
While our OpEx is staying essentially flat, so massive leverage in the 
business. So when you combine all of that, that's what is giving us the cash 
flow from operations to fund the rest of our business and grow cash.
 
I'm 
stating the obvious, but just sort of summarizing the whole point. Yeah.

up was on in terms of order of magnitude, does like $20,000 per

Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Securities International
 
Yes. Thanks very much. I guess my question is for the Autopilot team. 
We've been 
looking forward to this fully autonomous coast
-
to
-
coast drive 
and, Elon, I think you sort of said on previous calls if I can paraphrase that 
the team has been focused on developing a full self
-
driving suite that would 
work basically on all different kinds 
of road conditions. And I'm just curious, 
what's holding back that capability today to go coast to coast? And are we 
closer now that you've strengthened the compute technology?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, we can do a coast to coast drive, especiall
y if we 

 
like if we pick a 
specific route and then write code to really make that route work, we could 
do a coast to coast route drive, but that would be kind of gaming the 
system. And I think it's really important for the autopilot team to be focused 
on 
fundamental safety of the existing features.
 
So that's 

 
the focus is really massively on safety of existing features. Then 
there's an advanced dev role that can do things like recognize traffic lights 
and stop signs and make hard right turns and that kind
 
of thing, but it's not 
at the safety level that's considered okay for release.
 
So that 

 
yeah, because it really, you want many lines of reliability for 
anything that's released to end customers. So I don't want to take the team 
off that until we feel lik
e we've really got everything as best we can for the 
core functionality.
 
Stuart, you want to add to that?
 
Stuart Bowers 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, I think the big thing I would say is to reiterate Elon's point. 
There's no question you can kind of build a 
demo around this stuff. The 
challenge right now for the team is just increasing the safety and utility of 
autopilot to over 250,000 cars we have today and pushing more out after 
that.
 
So I think when we look forward to what the next probably 6 to 12 months
 
look like, it's taking those same kind of features we've been working on, 
probably deploying them in the form of active safety features. That's like a 
thing we can do already to understand like 

 
use this rich understanding of 
the environment to actually 
try to keep you safer, to either beep or brake. 
And then also, of course like one huge advantage that we have is we can 
understand what humans actually did in these vehicles and test our software 
to make sure that we would have made decisions that were sim
ilar if not 
safer. So that's going to be a huge part of what we do over the next 
probably two quarters.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, that said, we might be able to pull off coast
-
to
-
coast demo before the 
end of the year if we 

 
but really like right
 
now Subaru (50:51) has not 
focused on the version 9 software release which has got a number of really 
cool things in it. And we're hoping to get that out to early access program in 
about four weeks and then broadly in September. That's the hardcore focus 
right now, and that will certainly include some significant advancements in 
autonomy. And then once that's out and stable, I think that could be a good 
time to work on the coast
-
to
-
coast drive.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah

Nomura Securities International
 
I don't 
know if you guys have shared what attach rates are for autopilot. 
And just as my follow up, I guess I'm curious what you can do to increase 
the number of cars that have that functionality. It would seem like the 
effects of auto margins and cash flows could
 
be pretty positive.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I think it's extremely powerful once people are comfortable using the 
technology and see just how much utility it brings. I think that is a very 
significant potential for margin gain in the 
future, but it's contingent on that 
functionality really making a difference. I think we will really start to see 
some of the breakthrough stuff in about a month or so.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay. Let's go to the next question.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Securities International
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of 
America.
 
John Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Good afternoon. Just a first question. Is it fair to assume the GA4 in the tent 
is now
 
essentially permanent? And if so, is this potentially a new model for 
capacity and capacity additions that might be much more capital efficient 
over time?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
What do you think, Jerome (52:44)?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I
t's permanent for now until we come up with something different or better, 
but personally, I think it's a good model to start assembly of any product. 
Gives a lot of flexibility, and then we can build and iterate over it. Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc
.
 
Like, necessity is the mother of invention, and when you have to do 
something quickly, then you just don't have time to spend a lot of capital. So 
it forces you to be capital efficient.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's taught us a lot of less
ons on how to be capital efficient in the 
general assembly area. And so, in that sense, those lessons will carry 
forward, John.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I think so, it's still by and large we'll be aiming for steel
-
frame 
buildings to be clear. I
t's not like (53:35) just become tents everywhere. 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean the tent itself might be a little bit of a distraction from actually the 
focus of what's happening inside. And then the methodology...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla
, Inc.
 
Yes. Exactly.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And that's a similar methodology that we've kind of reverted back to and 
then moved forward from in the module, where we simplified and then did a 
very, very linear intuitive process that was a bit mor
e manual and then have 
automated and scaled that up as we understand it and get good control of it. 
And I think that's a lesson that we're taking to heart broadly across other 
things that we're going to do in the future and it's an efficient way to scale 
u
p.
 
John Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
I mean, is that replication of that simplicity why you think Shanghai could be 
that much less costly and that then Model Y capacity might be that much 
less costly to add?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, Model Y is sort of a whole separate thing but it's definitely one of the 
elements that convinced us that we can scale up quickly and at low CapEx in 
Shanghai, where we do an improved version of GA4. And then, we're also 
figuring out how to make the p
aint shop a lot simpler and general assembly 
a lot simpler. And after this call, I'm headed back out to the...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Body shop.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The body shop and making the body shop a lot simpler.
 
Jeffrey B. 
Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Making it a lot simpler.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, we can really simplify the body shop, man. Wow. And there's a lot that 
we can really easily improve like design to manufacturing and changing 
some of the joining approaches
 
that we use and actually making the car 
lighter, cheaper and better and actually stabler. Yeah, it's really, (55:20) 
safe already, but yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Maybe one other point, just to follow up quickly. I think some people have 
taken
 
this as like a walk back from automation, which is not really accurate.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
This is basically, I mean, a more thoughtful and focused way to apply 
automation to the actual issues th
at matter most.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. That's well said. Actually, it's really worth emphasizing JB's point here. 
Yeah. We're seeing a gain.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's not an overall reduction in automation. It is a focusing o
f our 
efforts automating the processes and the value
-
add processes that matter 
the most and I think we got maybe a little bit distracted on this first round 
automating a lot of things that added complexity that didn't necessarily 
speed up. And...
 
Elon Reev
e Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Way too fancy.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And we can save...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Start simple and get fancy later. Fancy's going to bite you in the ass.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
But it's not like we're referri
ng to the dark ages of all manual everything. 
That's not at all the case.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, Gigafactory is ...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Massively automated.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Massively automated. It's 
pretty crazy. And the body production is also 
heavily automated, almost entirely robots. So it's a mixture of people and 
automation. There's so much that goes into producing a car going from raw 
metal and plastic and glass to an actual finished car. And, y
eah, as JB was 
saying, the vast majority of that is highly automated.
 
John Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. If I can sneak in one quick follow
-
up? I mean, when we look at the 
grosses on the Model 3, you're saying 15% in 3Q, 20% in 4Q and I thin
k the 
ultimate target is 25%. I mean, what are the average transaction prices you 
guys are assuming? I mean, it sounds like they are going to be bit higher 
earlier but is that 25% gross ultimately still built around the low
-
40,000 
ATP?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Te
sla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
John Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The simple answer is yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It'll be lower ASPs than what we have today, clearly, and we are having a 
richer mix of All
-
Wheel Drive, as 
Elon alluded to earlier, so that's going to 
help, but yeah. 25% is still the target that we have ahead of us.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I'm highly confident that it may not be Q1 but I would be shocked if it's not 
Q2 that we get to 25%.
 
John Murphy

ank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. Thank you very much.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Haissl with Berenberg.
 
Alexander Haissl 
-
 
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG 
(United 
Kingdom)
 
Good evening, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. I would like to 
come back to the point made on the manufacturing efficiencies. I mean, 
(58:10) two main challenges for Tesla but also for the rest of the industry is 
the manufactu
ring parts, which has been overcome by a lot of companies 
already, with the second one being the technology part. My question is how 
would you describe the learning curve of the manufacturing process versus 
technology and what is really the pace of advance
ment you're making? 
Because it looks like on the manufacturing side the curve maybe has 
meaningfully accelerated here. Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, I don't really know actually how others do it to be totally frank. I just 
know that the wa
y we 

 
I see the way we are doing it and I'm told that this 
is how others do it and we're able to find ways to make it much better. I 
don't know what the delta would be though.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We also don't really I think 
differentiate it quite the way maybe you're 
implying. I mean, technology and manufacturing are sort of one and the 
same in many cases and we're treating a lot of the manufacturing problems 
as a technology problem.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Exactl
y.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And applying our design teams, our technology teams, if you want to call 
them that, to solving those issues. So I think the learning curves in some 
ways are quite similar.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. In fact, it
's amazing how much of production is actually software. 
We're really quite good at software relative to other car companies and 
manufacturing at volume is mostly a software problem. I think that was not 
well appreciated.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I
 
think maybe one other lesson learned is that it's obviously not the best 
approach or best efficiency to outsource some of that development.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Some of the areas that we struggled the most 
through the Model 3 ramp 
were those where we had perhaps less visibility, and less control, and less 
direct kind of skin in the game on how those production lines were designed 
and built.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And these are cases where we took 

 
we
 
engaged with companies that were 
supposed to be world class experts in automotive production and we just 
assumed that they would do stuff that worked but it didn't.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So that learning curve often involves Tesla coming direc
tly in, understanding 
the process intimately, simplifying it, and then essentially doing our own 
design or changes to the lines that were built. I think that's a key learning 
point that we've taken and I think the way that we can do this a lot more 
efficie
ntly in the future is doing that approach from the start.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Just having that very rapid iteration between design and production is 
incredibly helpful and we understand for example, what are the rate limiters, 
what makes it hard 
to produce battery modules. We came up with a new 
design that achieves the same outcome, that's actually lighter, better, 
cheaper and will be introducing that around the end of this year, probably 
reach volume production on that in Q1 or something. That wi
ll make the car 
lighter, better, and cheaper and achieve a higher range. That line is under 
construction, will be active in about six months.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We did this somewhat the first time around but now there's I think even 
more exc
iting understanding of the value of having those 

 
as Elon said, 
having the design engineers just working intimately with automation and 
line engineers, simplifying the process as they're designing the product.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, b
ecause we're sort of desperate to try to get the production 
working, we actually took a design engineering team and had them work in 
the factory and improve it, work on production and it's given them 
tremendous insight into how they need to change the desi
gns in the future 
to make it easier to produce because you feel the pain directly. Once you 
feel the pain, like okay, didn't realize I was torturing people with my terrible 
design. Now I know.
 
Martin Viecha

Great. Let's go to the next questio

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Elon, (1:02:44) sunglasses.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Hello.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Douglas Adams. Can we do more Douglas Adams.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
And less everything else.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. He is one of my favorite authors.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Rob
ert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
And mine too. Deepak, so after July here, how close are you to cash flow 
positive?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So your question is after July, how close are we to cash flow positive?
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., In
c.
 
Yeah, you have July under the books here, so how close are you to cash flow 
positive?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, well, we don't have let me tell this point, one, we don't have July 
results done but it doesn't matter exactly where we are in the mon
th of July. 
What really matters is over the quarter because it depends on deliveries, 
depends on production, many factors. So we will be significantly cash flow 
positive for the quarter. I think that's what really matters.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And
 
like the logic question is like do we have like a low balance in the bank? 
The answer is no, we've got 

 
we're in no 

 
we're not in any kind of cash 
shortage at all.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, that's a simple answer.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Ar
e we running low on money? The answer is no.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
No, no, no. That's not the question. It's just as you're here and you have 

 
you're selling your higher priced cars for better margin, how's the third 
quarter 
look for what you said, for being cash flow positive?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I'd say highly confident of being cash flow positive and being GAAP 
profitable in Q3.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We're sitting here today saying that based on 
what our expectation is. So 
yes, sitting here on August 1.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Is there anything we know at the end of July, it's one month in, we're highly 
confident of being cash flow positive and GAAP profitable in Q3 and Q4. Now 
there could b
e force majeure like earthquake, touch wood, but something 
like that or massive recession all of a sudden, but in the absence of that, of 
really unusual...
 
Deepak Ahuja

Tesla, Inc.
 
Straightforward.

Great. Thank you very much. Let's go to a journalist question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Higgins with Wall Street 
Journal.
 
Tim Higgins 
-
 
The 
Wall Street Journal
 
Hi. Thanks for the call. Question for you. Do you still plan to make a total of 
1 million vehicles in the calendar year of 2020?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think so, yeah. If it's not a million, it's going to be pretty close. I'd s
ay if 
it's not a million it'd probably be 750,000 or something like that in 2020. So, 
we're aiming for a million, 2020, but somewhere between half million and a 
million seems pretty likely.
 
Tim Higgins 
-
 
The Wall Street Journal
 
Where do you get the capacit
y to do that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
There's this place called Shanghai.
 
Tim Higgins 
-
 
The Wall Street Journal
 
Okay. Shanghai will be important for that, that goal?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Tim Higgins 
-
 
The Wall Street Journal
 
Okay. 
Where does the Model Y...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think so. Yeah, I think we can do over half a million vehicles 

 
actually 
probably more like 600,000 vehicles with current Giga and Fremont, and so 
they could throw 100,000, 200,000, maybe more,
 
couple hundred thousand 
from Shanghai. We're probably going to be more than 600,000 with Fremont 
and Giga, Nevada. That's why I think maybe it's not 

 
I think we have a shot 
at a million but somewhere 700,000, 800,000 seems pretty likely given the 
current
 
what we know today.
 
Tim Higgins 
-
 
The Wall Street Journal
 
Have you made any decisions on where you're going to make the Model Y, 
anyway you'd like to tell me?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Not yet.
 
Tim Higgins

The Wall Street Journ
al
 
Got you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Zachary Shahan with 
CleanTechnica.
 
Zachary Shahan 
-
 
CleanTechnica
 
Hello. First of all, thanks for the recent retweet, Elon. I was really impressed 
with the Model 3 after owning a Model S, so I'm 
really impressed how much 
you've developed since the early days. My first question was about Conquest 
sales, actually. Right before the call we published an article that Camry sales 
were down 22% year
-
over
-
year, Prius sales were down 23% year
-
over
-
year 
and
 
we're very curious how much you're pulling from these other cars, other 
segments. It sounds like you sort of answered that question at the 
beginning, but can you give anything in terms of what percentage those top 
five are in terms of trade
-
in sales? And 
how broad you're pulling? I know you 
pull from pickup trucks, from sports cars. Can you speak a little more about 
the diversity you're pulling from?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Actually, what we have right now is just the top five. So I'm not sure what 
the allocation is between top five or where it goes beyond top five. We just 
sort of out of curiosity asked for the top five breakdown. And it's just 
interesting that people are tr
ading up into a Tesla, so they're choosing to 
spend more money on a Tesla than their current car, just based on the 
trade
-
in values. A Civic is a very inexpensive car compared to particularly 
the Model 3 today. So that's promising from a market access stan
dpoint.
 
But of course, long term, we're going to do the Model Y and compact SUV. 
We're going to do the pickup truck, the Semi, the next generation bus 
(1:09:38). We got lots of awesome ideas, and probably the biggest limiter 
on our growth is like how fast 
can we grow battery production? And 
especially cell production and the wholesale supply chain I think will be the 
fundamental determinant of Tesla's growth.
 
Zachary Shahan 
-
 
CleanTechnica
 
And regarding the...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We're super 
fired up to do the set. I think they're all super cool. I know 
Jerome's favorite is the Semi, and that's pretty wicked, obviously. And...
 
Zachary Shahan 
-
 
CleanTechnica
 
I love it.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's great. And the where we unveiled 

 
we've actually figured 

 
we've 
made significant improvements to the design since the unveiling that we 
had, and it's really even better than what we talked about. Probably my 
personal favorite for the next product is pickup truck, and we are going to 
just 
do an amazing pickup truck. And the Model Y, compact SUV, probably 
the most popular car category in the world, so that's like obviously going to 
sell pretty well. So a lot of cool things.
 
And of course, Tesla Energy, getting the 

 
we're kind of cell starve
d for 
Powerwall right now, so we actually had to artificially limit the number of 
Powerwalls because we don't have enough cells. So we're solving for that 
very rapidly and we expect to ramp up Powerwall and Powerpack production 
substantially later this yea
r and early next and as well as ramping up retrofit 
solar and then the Solar Roof.
 
We now have several hundred homes with the Solar Roof on them, and 
that's going well. It takes a while to just confirm that the Solar Roof is going 
to last for 30 years and 
all the details work out, and we're working with first 
responders to make sure it's safe in the event of a fire and that kind of 
thing. So it's quite a long validation program for a roof which has got to last 
for 30, 40, 50 years, but we also expect to ram
p that up next year at our 
Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo. That's going to be super exciting. If there's a 
company with a better product roadmap, I'd like to know where it is, 
because we've got some super awesome stuff coming. Yeah.
 
Zachary Shahan 
-
 
CleanTechnic
a
 
And regarding the Model Y, there's been a lot of questioning if you're going 
to have the same process as with Model 3 with reservations, if you're going 
to shorten the reservation timeline or if you're going to have a different 
process this time around.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We haven't made a final decision on that.
 
Zachary Shahan 
-
 
CleanTechnica
 
So a last question then. Regarding the daily production, we've been seeing a 
rise and fall with the daily production of the Model 3 as you incorporate ne
w 
performance or white seats. Can you speak at all 

 
we always like to get the 
technical side of what you're doing there. Can you speak at all about what 
the bottlenecks are right now that you're working through and what we can 
sort of 

 
how we can picture
 
ourselves in the factory there with you?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
All right. And actually one of the things I love about your writing is that you 
really care about getting the details right, and you really understand things 
well, which is awesome. Bu
t I have to be careful I don't have a sound bite 
that is then for those that don't have a nuanced appreciation of the 
situation, that sound bite then gets 

 
becomes front page news. So it's like, 
nope, that's not what I meant.
 
Zachary Shahan

CleanTechnic
a
 
Yeah. We know.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly. I'm like, oh, man, this is like shooting myself in the foot 
there. Right now, the biggest constraint on production again, please, do not 
make a federal case out of this, because it's something t
hat's solved like in a 
matter of a week or two, is body production. So that's why 

 
you can 
generally tell what am I personally working on, that's going to be the 
bottleneck in the company most likely, so reducing Model 3 bodies. We've 
made huge progress i
n the last few weeks and in fact I was just told that we 
were able to achieve our first 24 hour period where we made over 800 Model 
3 bodies which is pretty great. So (1:14:34) sustain that 800 plus per day 
rate and then (1:14:41) doing great, Jay (1:14:41
) is doing great. Yeah, it's 
good.
 
Zachary Shahan

CleanTechnica
 
Yeah. I've got 47 questions. But I'll end with a quick request. Years ago 
you...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sorry. Go ahead.
 
Zachary Shahan 
-
 
CleanTechnica
 
Years ago you warned about a 
coming short tsunami and it seemed obvious 
it was coming, but the shorts didn't really seem to recognize it and then sort 
of attacked you, trolled you for months and then finally, it came. You again, 
warned very honestly, I think very directly, that there'
s going to be an epic 
short squeeze. We have I think the whole community has a little request. 
Don't let the trolls get you down, don't see the trolls too much, but we do 
like it when you tease the trolls a bit. So use your judgment. But thanks a 
lot for w
hat you're doing.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
All right. Well, thank you for your in
-
depth coverage of clean
-
energy 
technology.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Thank you very much and the very last question comes from Galileo Russell 
(01:15:44) who represent
s the retail shareholders.
 
Unknown Speaker
 
Congrats on an awesome quarter. Really proud to be a Tesla shareholder 
with the Model 3 ramping to 5,000 a week. And I think you may have 
touched on this but I'm curious. Will Tesla ever produce vehicles at 
Gigafa
ctory 1, maybe the Semi? And then I'm curious on any manufacturing 
synergies between the Semi and the Model 3.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Oh wow. Interesting questions. You always come up with really interesting 
questions. Really interesting questions t
hat I cannot actually 

 
the first one I 
cannot 

 
it gets so much attention, where we put production. So I can't 
answer any like where we're going to put production questions. Will the 
Semi use a bunch of Model 3 technology? The answer is yes. Jerome don't 
know if you want to elaborate on that or 

 
up to you.
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, I mean you can already see in the prototype that we've leverage a lot 
of the Model 3 components, the screens...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Te
sla, Inc.
 
...the door handles. I mean as much as possible...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The motors.
 
Jerome Guillen 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, the motors, yeah, in the prototype, a lot of the cell technology. But 
there are some changes and I'd rather not make t
hat public. Yeah, obviously 
it's going to be better than what we showed last year. There is a lot of 
improvements, yeah.
 
Unknown Speaker
 
Okay. So hopefully you can talk more about this with the battery project, 
with PG&E that was recently announced. I'm wo
ndering if you could 
elaborate how you're prioritizing battery pack between auto and energy 
storage. Because it seems like you ramped auto battery pack to 20 gigawatt 
hours in the past 12 months, but are only guiding for about 1 gigawatt hour 
of Tesla Ener
gy installation in the next year. So I'm wondering why is Tesla 
Energy, given its supply constraint, like why not ramp up supply to 10 
gigawatts? It seems like the guidance is a little low there.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, as Elon suggested earlier, 
we are 

 
essentially makes sense for us to 
prioritize Model 3, but we are adding a ton of capacity, cell capacity and JB 
can talk more about it that will enable us to dramatically ramp our energy 
storage business as well in the coming quarters.
 
Jeffrey B. 
Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, you kind of mentioned only 1 gigawatt hour. But that's a big number 
in that business. And that's maybe on the order of 300% what we did the 
prior year and we're still aiming at maybe another 3x to 4x growth for 2019.
 
Elon Reeve
 
Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
These are mad 

 
at scale, these are insane growth levels.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Crazy growth rate.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, It's not like shipping a software. This is like you actually need to build 

 
it's 
like a lot of atoms...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No offence to software.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, no, no, I mean like once you build software, you can obviously have 
lots of copies, but like when it's like a lot of really complicated atom
s, man, 
hard.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Maybe specifically also your cell 

 
to the cell
-
limitation question. I think this 
has been mentioned before but we also do use some other vendors.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Oh, yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(1:18:50) Panasonic.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. We use Samsung and LG and yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly, in our energy products. So I've heard people feel like this is kind of 
a zero
-
sum game or something with Model 3
 
but that is not the case. And 
we do...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's a partial
-
sum game. We did shut down a Powerwall cell line in favor of 
Model 3 to be totally honest but we kind of had to do that. But we're adding 
new cell lines and we'll be able 
to address that issue very soon.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think to put it in perspective, we are soon tripling our storage.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
These are mad growth numbers. Mad.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And it's one thing to produce, but i
t's also another thing to install.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You need infrastructure and the people to do that. So, it's massive scaling as 
very few companies grow at that rate.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, 
Inc.
 
Yeah, and one of the biggest challenges like, we've got a 

 
there needs to be 
a lot more electricians. So we actually had an electrician training program. 
We're going to actually have to train new people who've never been 
electricians before to be ele
ctricians because otherwise there's not enough 
electrician capacity in the United States and the most places in the world to 
install Powerwalls.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So it's like we have to actually 
literally train electricians and it takes like two 
years basically before somebody is certified to be an electrician. So it's sort 
of like, okay, we obviously can't grow faster than the rates, the number of 
electricians who can physically install a Powerwa
ll. That's like one of the 
limitations.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And that PG&E project you mentioned is an incredibly exciting one. It kind of 
is indicative...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's awesome actually.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla,
 
Inc.
 
...of the growth rate. It has a...
 
Unknown Speaker
 
Yeah, can you elaborate on that?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We can't say too much.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I hope I haven't said anything that's like (1:20:31).
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tes
la, Inc.
 
It is over 1 gigawatt hour.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, gigawatt hour. That's public, right?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Fully considered.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It is now.
 
Elon 
Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay. All right, okay.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And just to give you a sense, it took us five years of growing that business 
to get to 1 gigawatt hour, cumulative deployed.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And there were like
 
so many people who had said 1 gigawatt hour is an 
impossible number for lithium ion. Like that's 

 
yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean, the car business is still much bigger as we sit here today but the 
growth rate on energy is faster.
 
Elon Ree
ve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, if you extrapolate energy growth rate, well, obviously, if you 
extrapolate anything, when that triples for a year pretty soon becomes the 
size of the universe, but long
-
term we would expect the energy business to 
catch up to the
 
auto business in size.
 
Unknown Speaker
 
Nice. And then, lastly, I'm really curious, Elon. Do you have any part of the 
business that shareholders should be asking or thinking more about? Or 
what do you wish would have been asked on the call?
 
Elon Reeve Musk
 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Good question. We were trying to anticipate 

 
actually, I try and anticipate 
the questions that are on people's minds, that's why we have the autopilot 
(1:21:40) autopilot team here and much of the executive team of Tesla here 
to try to be p
roactive in that regard. And is there anything...
 
Unknown Speaker
 
Well, I guess, in terms of...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think we really covered a lot. So if there's any 

 
yeah.
 
Unknown Speaker
 
Just very last thing.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You
r very last thing. Go ahead.
 
Unknown Speaker
 
Yeah, sorry. One last thing. The new fiscal engineering strategy of profits 
and cash flow and you saying that would last in perpetuity sort of caught me 
by surprise, personally. And so I'm curious if there's any
 
trade
-
off to growth 
with that new strategy or sort of what's the rationale behind the scenes 
because this seems like the biggest change in Tesla's financial engineering 
strategy since the IPO.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, being cash flow 
positive and capping at positive doesn't mean like 

 
doesn't mean we're rolling in money. There's definitely going to be cases 
where we're just barely cash flow positive or barely profitable in some 
quarters in the future. But I think it's been a long time
, almost 15 years 
now. I think we're at a scale where the amount of time that it takes to 
actually scale up and do things is 

 
there's a certain 

 
like we're big enough, 
where we actually can spend money efficiently to make things go faster.
 
So we kind of 
hit scale with volume production of cars. And I think we can 

 
I think this is probably the right thing to do is to be sort of essentially self
-
funding on a go forward basis and apart from selective situations where 
there's say some debt 

 
temporary debt f
or construction of a Gigafactory in 
China or Europe or something like that. But apart from that, I think we 

 
essentially like I don't think we're constraining growth in any significant way 
by adopting this strategy at this point. It would have been true i
n times 
past, but I think it is no longer the case, yeah.

2/20/14,Tesla,"Our first question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
open.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Hey everybody. First I had a question on your forward
-
year guidance of 
100,000 unit run rate by the end of 2015. Can you give us some sense of 
how much of that's coming from China? I mean we understand the demand 
for your products in China is off
-
the
-
chart strong, but we're a little 
concerned about your ability to deliver and service the volume while focusing 
100% on the quality and building the 
brand off intensity. So maybe how 
many China stores or service centers would you need by this time next year 
that might be commensurate with that volume target.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. Well, and this is sort of give you rough guesses on the 100K run rate 
within th
e next year, which I think is, you know, actually one of the most 
interesting things in our newsletter which you picked up on. We're expecting 
that to be sort of roughly split between X and S. So we're talking a little 
--
 
roughly 1,000 units a week of each
.
 
And when you look at the market demand for SUVs and sedans, that's about 
the split; it's almost exactly 50/50. In fact I think recently SUVs might have 
slightly edged ahead of sedans.
 
So if we 
--
 
so it's sort of reasonable to expect that if one has 
--
 
ju
st address 
the demand and then the servicing side of things 
--
 
it's reasonable to expect 
that if we see sort of a comfortable 1,000 unit demand on the sedan side, 
well, probably we should expect that similar number on the SUV side. My 
guess is we'll actual
ly see slightly higher on the SUV side. I think the Model 
X is going to a phenomenal car.
 
On the service front, we are spending a lot of money on service expansion. 
That's our primary, in the sort of sales and service arena, it's primarily 
service, like th
e overall majority is service really.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Good.
 
Elon Musk
 
So it's not really 
--
 
I contend it's not demand generation but how do we 
make sure that that demand is well
-
served.
 
So in terms of number of stores by the end of next year 
--
 
or number of 
service centers I should say by the end of next year, actually I don't have 
that off
-
hand. But it's probably on the order of 100 in China alone, I'm 
guessing, by the end of next year.
 
We are 
--
 
and probably worldwide it's on the order of 300.
 
This is 
--
 
I'm 
speaking off the cuff here 
--
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Sure.
 
Elon Musk
 
--
 
but probably north of 300 worldwide.
 
And I'd say I've been very impressed with the Tesla China team and the 
quality of people that we're attracting in China. I mea
n I think the China 
team is smart and they work super
-
hard, so. And the pace of progress is just 
amazing. So I feel pretty comfortable about being able to do good service in 
China or great service actually. In fact, like the key metric we measure in 
servic
e is the percentage of customers that are delighted, which is a 10 out 
of 10 score. That's both the primary thing we look at. And our goal is to get 
that worldwide to a majority of customers.
 
And domestically, I believe we're actually 
--
 
but in the U.S. we
're about 70% 
of customers who experienced service rated as perfect, or yeah, 10 out of 10 
is actually.
 
And another key metric we measure is the average time to service 
something. So our average is less than a day. So the car is 
--
 
so, in most 
cases we can
 
actually pick up your car, fix anything that's wrong with it, and 
give it back to you, without you even knowing it was gone. So you just tell 
us like my car is at my office and this is where it is, and we'll pick up the car, 
fix it, and get it back to you
 
before you finish work.
 
Our goal with service is sort of invisible up, which is, is there even 
--
 
it's like 
elves [ph] service delivery [ph]. Like you don't even see it. It's like 
--
 
it 
happens so fast. And once done, you'll love it.
 
And so I think there'
s like 
--
 
there's an interesting opportunity to 
revolutionize service as well. It's not just like, oh, let's do the same thing as 
before. I think it was a lot of lessons learned from a Formula One car 
approach. So, because we're not trying to serve custome
rs for the most 
amount of money possible in a service, which is typical of the conventional 
auto industry, we want to get the job done super
-
fast, and then also make 
sure that you don't 
--
 
like we want to anticipate issues so you don't have to 
come back ag
ain.
 
And so we actually bring the car and we kind of hit with a pit crew, like a 
Formula One pit crew. So instead of having one person per bay, the car gets 
slowly worked on over several days, it actually comes in and a team attacks 
it, and we're constantl
y improving the tools and the metrics to say, how can 
we get the car perfect as fast as possible. We actually bring in people from 
Formula One to help with the training on this. And I think there's a real 
opportunity to revolutionize the way service works.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
That's great color, Elon. Can I just ask a follow
-
up? Outside of BMW, any 
other parties 
--
 
can you say any other parties that have expressed interest 
in your patent
-
sharing gesture? I'm curious to think why you think the 
--
 
why
 
the industry is moving towards hydrogen in this 
--
 
or so much of the 
industry seems to be pushing hydrogen like crazy in the past few months. Is 
this a bullshit move to kind of CARB [ph] to rewrite the rules on EVs, or do 
you think they actually believe t
his stuff?
 
And then just finally, can you confirm the rumor that Mr. Berns [ph] tried to 
kill you by running you over in an I8 [ph]? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
He does intend to kill me in the Simpsons, but not in an I8 [ph].
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Maybe a 
vault [ph].
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Well, I don't, as you know, I'm not the biggest proponent of hydrogen. 
RV and JB might be [indiscernible] you know. But really if you take a 
theoretically optimal fuel cell car and compare that to a car in production, 
battery el
ectric car, on key metrics of mass, volume complexity, cost, 
refilling infrastructure, it's just 
--
 
it's a loss. So it's the best case in our 
opinion, the best case fuel cell car, and obviously the fuel cell cars are far 
from best case, cannot be the curre
nt case electric car, well, why even try 
it? That just makes no sense. Success is not one of the possible outcomes.
 
JB, anything you'd want to elaborate on that?
 
JB Straubel
 
I think that really it's pretty clear, the only real benefits that get touted for 
fuel cell and hydrogen vehicles are potentially range and refill time, but both 
of those are not [indiscernible] benefits when you look at where battery 
technology is today and certainly where it's going in a few years. So I think 
people make a mistake of 
comparing today's technology with future 
potential technology instead of two technologies at the same point in time.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. I mean even if you take theoretical optimal, like theoretically perfect 
[indiscernible] I just don't think you [indiscernib
le].
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
But then, JB, like why are they doing 
--
 
why are they doing this? That's why 
I asked if it's BS. Is this just kind of a diversionary tactic or do you think 
they're just not on 
--
 
what's up?
 
Elon Musk
 
We're quite confused ab
out this.
 
JB Straubel
 
Yeah. It does not make a lot of sense. I mean we didn't even touch on the 
infrastructure challenges that hydrogen brings, but building out that 
infrastructure is substantially more expensive than building out any electric 
vehicle infr
astructure. And there's almost none of it today.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. Also another thing too, like hydrogen is an energy carrier, not an 
energy source. So you have to create the hydrogen, which is really 
inefficient. Because you'd either have to crack a hydroca
rbon or electrolyzed 
water.
 
JB Straubel
 
And if you want to do it renewably, the water electrolysis route is really the 
only 
--
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, which is super inefficient. Yeah.
 
And then hydrogen has very low density, so if you're going to pick it 
chemical 
energy storage mechanism, the hydrogen is a terrible choice. Like 
at least, you know, methane, CH4, lock up the hydrogen with one carbon 
atom or something. Anyway 
--
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Maybe that answers the question.
 
JB Straubel
 
It doesn't make a
 
lot of sense.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Jeff Evanson
 
All right. Thanks a lot, Adam. We should get to the next caller please.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Andrea James with Doherty & Company. Your 
line is open.
 
Andrea James 

 
Doherty & Co.
 
Thanks for 
taking my questions. First one is I guess about quality control. 
Can you talk about the improvements you've made in quality control and 
where you think it needs to go? Maybe with a nod toward what's going on 
with the drive train systems?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. We
 
definitely had some quality issues in the beginning for the 
[indiscernible] number of cars, because we're just basically figuring out how 
to make the Model S. And I think we've addressed almost all of those CARB 
[ph] production cars, I mean not all, but t
he vast majority have been 
addressed in cars that are being produced today.
 
And we're also getting better at diagnosing what's wrong, because in some 
cases we, particularly with respect to the drive unit, we think that something 
is wrong with the drive uni
t but it's actually something wrong with another 
part of the car. And then we'd replace the drive unit and that wouldn't solve 
the problem because the drive unit was not the problem.
 
And we had one particular case where there was vibration, and it was due 
to 
--
 
it was due to the 
--
 
a cable detaching itself and touching the drive unit 
assembly and causing vibration to be transmitted to the body of the car. And 
it was somewhat pernicious because if the cable moved a little bit and so 
that it didn't provide a 
conductive path, then you wouldn't 
--
 
the vibration 
would go away. If you replace the drive unit, you temporarily tuck the cable 
back and think the problem was solved and it was 
--
 
but then the cable 
would vibrate itself down and transmit the energy. So I 
mean that, you 
know, the cable thing takes us like 
--
 
it's nothing to fix it. It's like, virtually, 
it's like a $3 cable tied to solve it.
 
So there's a bunch of things like that which are just [indiscernible] diagnosis 
of the problems that we've obviously 
addressed.
 
There are a few items that will need a fair number of drive pans [ph] will 
need to be serviced. It's actually related 
--
 
one particularly is related to the 
differential, and we need to assume [ph] the differential. It doesn't require 
drive unit 
replacement, it just requires a technician to insert a Shim [ph]. 
We're going to have to do that on a fair number of cars. But that's like a 
$0.50 Shim [ph].
 
So it's really 
--
 
I wouldn't assume that there's going to be some vast number 
of drive pans [ph] t
hat will need to replaced, but there's several service 
buttons [ph] that we'll be instituting, many of which we've already have to 
address the issue.
 
And every week I have a product excellence meeting, which is to 
--
 
which is 
a cross
-
functional group, so w
e've got engineering, service and production, 
and we go about all the issues that the customer is reporting with the car, 
and, you know, the action items that we addressed to get car ultimately to 
-
-
 
photonic ideal of a perfect car, that's what we're aimin
g for. Because 
although we 
--
 
I think we've got great service, but that service is no service. 
That's really what we want, is a car that never needs to be serviced. And I 
think we're getting there quite rapidly.
 
Andrea James 

 
Doherty & Co.
 
Would you say y
ou're satisfied more so with the quality control function and 
team you have in place?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think at this point we've got an excellent quality control team. And we 
weren't there in the beginning but I'm confident that we're there now. I 
mean our aspi
ration is sort of order magnitude better quality than any other 
car. And I 
--
 
we'll keep at it unrelentingly until we get there.
 
Andrea James 

 
Doherty & Co.
 
And then just to flip over to the Giga Factory, it says in the shareholder 
letter you've broken gr
ound in Nevada, and I guess it's out there in the 
blogosphere that construction paused. So I guess my question is, you know, 
why slow it down? And do you have a drop
-
dead date for when you really 
need to make sure you're really up and going?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah
. We've essentially completed the 
--
 
creating the pad, the construction 
pad for the Giga Factory [ph] in Nevada. So in terms of creating a flat pad 
and getting the rocky foundation, that is substantially complete. There's still 
a little bit of work ongoing
.
 
We're going to be doing something similar in one or two other states, which 
is something I previously said we'd do, because I think it makes sense to 
have multiple things going in parallel.
 
Before we actually go to the next stage of pouring a lot of conc
rete though, 
we want to make sure we have things sorted out at the sort of state level, 
that the incentives are there that makes sense, and [indiscernible] the state 
and Tesla. But I do want to emphasize that we're not 
--
 
Tesla is not going to 
ink up for a
 
deal that is unfair to the state or unfair to Tesla. We want to 
make sure it's compelling for all parties.
 
And, you know, so I think on the Nevada side, at this point the ball is on the 
court of the governor and the state legislature.
 
Andrea James 

 
Doher
ty & Co.
 
Is Panasonic having any input into the site selection process?
 
Elon Musk
 
We're keeping them closely informed, and so that 
--
 
where all the details. 
And they haven't 
--
 
they haven't volunteered advice necessarily. We'd 
certainly listen to 
their advice if they provided it. But they seem to be in 
accordance with our theory on location.
 
JB Straubel
 
Yeah. And Tesla is managing all of the utilities and infrastructure at the Giga 
Factory [ph] sites. So in that regard, you know, Tesla is basically
 
aggregating the inputs and requirements from not just Panasonic but other 
potential partners as well. So it's primarily Tesla's role to be evaluating those 
sites.
 
Andrea James 

 
Doherty & Co.
 
Appreciate it. Thank you so much.

Our next question co
mes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is 
open.
 
Ryan Brinkman 

 
JPMorgan
 
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.
 
Earlier in the year you had discussed the potential I think $4 billion to $5 
billion investment in the Giga Factory through 202
0. Is that still the number 
that you're working with? And I think too you had planned for the CapEx to 
be shared by the Giga Factory partners. In your press release this morning 
you mentioned that Panasonic will provide equipment, you the buildings, 
utilit
ies, et cetera. Do you think you're on track to sign suppliers on to 
provide $2 billion to $3 billion of investment? And over what rough 
timeframe might we expect you to announce those partners and their 
respective investment commitments?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. Y
es, that $4 billion to $5 billion number is we think probably accurate. 
I mean particularly over through 2020, I think it'll be closer to $4 billion, 
maybe slightly less than that, before we get to initial high
-
volume 
production. But then as we do continue
d investments to improve output and 
improve the technology of the pack, it's probably closer to the $5 billion over 
the 2020 timeframe, but probably less than $4 billion to get up to serious 
production.
 
And then of that number, we see Tesla probably provid
ing 40% to 50% of 
the total, Panasonic probably about 30% to 40%, the states maybe 10%, 
and other industrial partners about 10%, maybe 15% to 20%, depending on 
how vertical [ph] we go with the factory.
 
And then with having signed the contract with Panasoni
c, I mean I think 
--
 
well, I was never really 
--
 
something I was in doubt from my standpoint, but 
I think some of these people take things [indiscernible] which are 
--
 
I mean 
there are 
--
 
they're going to be fairly conservative in their words, but I think 
the actions are really what matter. And Panasonic has always taken the 
actions of an excellent partner. So we feel confident that there will be the 
amount of money needed to reach the 35 gigawatt
-
hour level at the cell 
level and 50 gigawatt
-
hour at the mod
ule impact [ph] level. The module 
impact [ph] stuff is all Tesla internal.
 
And then we're expecting precursor 
--
 
suppliers have the precursor materials 
from the [indiscernible] separator, maybe the electrolyte, to be also present 
in the factory.
 
Ryan Brink
man 

 
JPMorgan
 
Right, that's extremely helpful and reassuring too. Switching gears, last 
question, is there anything you can say at all on the trend to Model X 
orders? I know that you don't disclose backlog, but perhaps you could speak 
qualitatively to it,
 
maybe how it compares to when you first started taking 
Model S orders or how many are maybe returning customers, is there any 
difference geographically, and who is preferring an SUV versus sedan, where 
the orders coming from, et cetera?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. I 
guess what's important to appreciate for the X, that there 
--
 
let's just 
put the orders in context. There are no cars available for a test drive. There 
is no information about the cars in our stores because we're only selling the 
S. In fact, if somebody co
mes in who wants to buy the X, we try to convince 
them to buy the S. So we anti
-
sell it. And we don't really provide all that 
much information or details about the car or provide [indiscernible] on when 
you can get it. Despite all that, there's huge demand
 
from around the world 
for the X.
 
Now I think that actually people are right, even though they don't have 
enough 
--
 
they don't really have enough information to know they're right, 
but they are.
 
Ryan Brinkman 

 
JPMorgan
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. It
's 
--
 
our issue is not 
--
 
we will not have a demand issue. Yeah.
 
Ryan Brinkman 

 
JPMorgan
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is open.
 
Colin Langan 

 
UBS
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the 
100,000 exit rate in 2025, 
is that 
--
 
I guess that implies that the battery constraints will be limited, and 
at what point should we think of sort of that battery constraint limiting you 
until the Giga Factory comes online?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. You can sort of 
see 
--
 
I mean we see a path to potentially, you know, 
150,000 cars a year. Maybe if you really push it, 200,000 cars a year, 
without the Giga Factory. So the Giga Factory is needed for that sort of 
--
 
that incremental 300,000 cars. But we can probably 
--
 
I
 
would guess that 
probably it could be pushed to a couple of 100,000 cars a year with the 
existing 
--
 
without the Giga Factory. That's probably a good guess. So, yeah, 
we'll sort of see where that leads.
 
Colin Langan 

 
UBS
 
And on the Giga Factory, I mean i
s the chemistry going to be the same 
battery chemistry that you're currently using or is that part of the 
discussions that are going on with Panasonic?
 
Elon Musk
 
There are improvements to the chemistry, as well as improvements to the 
[indiscernible]. So we would expect to see an energy density improvement, 
and of course a significant cost improvement.
 
JB, do you want to [indiscernible]?
 
JB Straubel
 
Yeah, that's, you know, the cathode and anode materials themselves are 
next generation, 
so we're 
--
 
I mean we're seeing improvements in the 
maybe 10% to 15% range on the chemistry itself.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, in terms of energy density.
 
JB Straubel
 
Energy density. And then, you know, we're also customizing the cell shape 
and size to further improv
e the cost efficiency of the cell, and our packaging 
efficiency.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right. We've done a lot of modeling trying to figure out what's the optimal 
cell size. And it's really not much 
--
 
it's not a lot different from where we are 
right now, but we're so
rt of in the roughly 10% more diameter, maybe 10% 
more height. But then the cubic function effectively ends up being, just from 
a geometry standpoint, probably a third more energy for the cell, if you 
--
 
maybe 30%
-
ish. And then the actual energy density pe
r unit mass 
increases, so.
 
JB Straubel
 
Yeah. Yeah, fundamentally the chemistry of what's inside is what really 
defines the cost position now. It's often debated what shape and size, but at 
this point we're developing basically what we feel is the optimum s
hape and 
size for the best cost efficiency for an automotive cell.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Colin Langan 

 
UBS
 
The chemical formula will be the same, it's just shaped differently or?
 
Elon Musk
 
No, no.
 
JB Straubel
 
No.
 
Colin Langan 

 
UBS
 
It's a different 
formula.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, yeah.
 
Colin Langan 

 
UBS
 
Okay. And just one last question. It sounds like the Giga Factory might be 
very vertically integrated. How do you think about that for the assembly of 
the model 
--
 
a model three [ph]? Do you need to be high
ly vertically 
integrated or do you think you'll probably outsource more of that to reduce 
the costs of that model?
 
Elon Musk
 
I don't think outsourcing decreases the cost. That tends to increase the cost 
in our experience. It's just like 
--
 
the reason we do
n't 
--
 
the reason we 
outsource stuff is just because we had too many fish to fry, otherwise. But 
it's almost always the case that 
--
 
when we've in
-
sourced something, it got 
cheaper. Yeah.
 
I mean it's just 
--
 
like if the 
--
 
the thing that would make us real
ly efficient 
-
-
 
or for any given technology level, is to say, how far did that molecule 
move? And if the molecule is taking several round trips around the world, 
that's expensive. If it's just moving from one station to the next, then that's 
obviously lowe
r cost. And so the vertical integration just means that the 
molecule doesn't move as much and it's not being put in a box and then put 
in a truck and then on a boat, and then, you know, going through customs 
and stuff like that.
 
So I mean I think that's ge
nerally true that a vertical integration and doing 
things at large scale results in cost reduction. I feel very confident with the 
30% cost reduction per unit of energy. We're obviously going to target 
something higher than that.
 
Colin Langan 

 
UBS
 
Okay. A
ll right, thank you very much.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is 
open.
 
Brian Johnson 

 
Barclays
 
Yes, thank you. Could you maybe help us understand how you think about 
the gap or how we ought to think about the 
gaps between production and 
deliveries? It looks like typically production's been running 900 to 1,200 
units in recent quarters ahead of deliveries. Your 4Q guide would actually 
imply delivery to roughly equal or actually a little bit higher than productio
n. 
So, can you help us kind of think through that?
 
Elon Musk
 
Production in Q4 significantly exceeds deliveries. I mean the time from when 
a car is produced to when it is delivered, it depends on the mix of domestic 
versus international, because when you 
--
 
when cars are sent to Europe or 
China, they've got 
--
 
obviously get on a boat and they got to get through 
customs, and it's sort of a more lengthy process. So, average time for 
delivery of a car in North America is about two weeks
-
ish, thereabout. And 
the
n for 
--
 
but for international deliveries, you've got to add another three to 
four weeks on top of that.
 
We try to tighten that down a little bit, but then if you blend the two, then 
maybe it's an average delivery time four or five weeks. So, you know, for
 
cars made in October, they would all be delivered in Q4.
 
Brian Johnson 

 
Barclays
 
Go ahead.
 
Unverified Company Representative
 
Yeah. The increase of our overall production, there are two factors that drive 
that gap. One is the ramp of production increase, 
the other one is the mix of 
international market.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right.
 
Unverified Company Representative
 
And even if the mix is the same but we're increasing production, it creates a 
bigger gap each quarter. And then clearly as we are shipping more to right
-
ha
nd drive markets and to China, our international mix is increasing too.
 
So each quarter is a slightly different story, but certainly there will be a gap 
as we continue.
 
Brian Johnson 

 
Barclays
 
Okay. So the implication of that though is your 
production in 4Q would be 
not slightly higher than 1,000 a week, that's more than slightly higher than 
1,000 a week.
 
Unverified Company Representative
 
Yeah, it'll be sufficiently higher that we still deliver to our expectations of 
slightly over 35,000 cars
 
this year.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. At 1,000 cars a week, I mean 1,000 cars a week steady state implies 
a 50,000 roughly rate number, in steady state. So it doesn't really need to 
be much 
--
 
all that much beyond 1,000 to achieve our goal, on average, for 
the Q4.
 
B
rian Johnson 

 
Barclays
 
Okay. And if you think about the difference between the roughly 500 to 600 
deliveries per week this quarter and the 1,000 a week rate you're talking 
about, what, you know, how would you waterfall the step
-
up in terms of the 
contribu
tion of the three key geographies, Europe, China, obviously Hong 
Kong is part of that, and then North America?
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean long term I'd probably 
--
 
I'd say it's 
--
 
well, there's not just China 
and Asia of course. But I think long term we're probably 
looking at, this is 
just a guess, but I mean maybe 40% Asia, 40% North America, 20% 
Europe, as a rough guess. And Asia is more than China for sure. We have 
people [indiscernible] in Japan and we, like go to Korea, Hong Kong. Hong 
Kong being sort of China, 
part of China of course, special administrative 
zone. And Australia and New Zealand and that kind of thing. So it's probably 
40% Asia Pacific region. And there we tend to do very well in our home 
markets in North America, has 40% there. And then Europe 
--
 
the demand 
is not just generally strong in Europe. But it's fair to say in Europe can have 
25% to 30% of the mix. Those are just a rough guess.
 
Brian Johnson 

 
Barclays
 
Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Your line is 
open.
 
Rod Lache
 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Hi everybody. You brought up a few times the future case electric car and 
you also mentioned that you're comfortable even in the near term with a 
30% reduction in costs for batteries per pax, most of which you said is 
logistics. I wanted t
o ask you two things on that. One is, is that additional 
10% to 15% that you talked about related to anode and cathode chemistry, 
is that incremental to the 30%?
 
And if you took a step back and thought about the trajectory for this in the 
next 10 years rat
her than in the next three years, what would you sort of 
--
 
what do you see on the horizon? Is there kind of a case for $100 per 
kilowatt
-
hour pack in 10 years?
 
Elon Musk
 
I'd be disappointed if it took us 10 years to get to $100 a kilowatt
-
hour 
pack.
 
Rod L
ache 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
So basically you're saying that, you know, within the next 
--
 
within that 
timeframe you would expect electric vehicles to reach cost parity and maybe 
even improve upon the cost of an internal combustion vehicle?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
Rod Lac
he 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Uh
-
huh. That's interesting.
 
Now another 
--
 
that's a pretty big statement.
 
Elon Musk
 
Seems pretty obvious to me.
 
In your question you had [indiscernible] should be corrected, like the 
--
 
so 
the 30% savings is not just due to logistics. Lo
gistics is a big factor. We are 
--
 
JB Straubel
 
It's not even the biggest though.
 
Elon Musk
 
Logistics [indiscernible] the fact that it's just go to one station to the next 
instead of going from multiple entities to multiple entities. But really when 
you 
get to the kinds of scale that we're talking about, you really get to 
design customer equipment that's much better at processing each step. And 
you really get to design the machine that makes the machine, not just do so 
with off
-
the
-
shelf equipment. So it 
took 
--
 
everything about it is going to get 
a whole lot better. That's why we think the 30% number when the Giga 
Factory is at full production is a conservative number. Yeah. And then, yeah. 
So.
 
Rod Lache 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
To get to those kind of targets bey
ond the 30%, is there some kind of 
breakthrough, you know, anode chemistries or things that you're looking at 
that you think are highly probable that are needed, or, you know, is it just a 
bunch of incremental steps that you see kind of playing out over th
e next 
years?
 
JB Straubel
 
Well, we're tracking things that have a whole range of different horizons for 
implementation. But to get to 
--
 
to realize the Giga Factory and those cost 
targets, we don't need some fundamental breakthrough in chemistry and 
materi
al science. That 
--
 
those things are pretty well
-
understood in front of 
us.
 
In the long term, there are a lot of very interesting, you know, long term 
being the 10 years perhaps you mentioned, or more, there's many very 
interesting things in the horizon wi
th reducing probabilities as you go further 
up.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Yeah, absolutely. It's 
--
 
yeah. It's heading to a place of no contest with 
respect to gas I mean. But I mean we're trying to make it go there as fast as 
possible because time is important here.
 
You know, the sooner this can be 
done, the sooner we can reduce carbon output and reduce the probability of 
a catastrophe. So, yeah. And the absence of Giga Factory, this progress will 
be much slower.
 
Rod Lache 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Just wanted to ask a quick k
ind of near
-
term question. You know, now that it 
sounds like you're buttoning down a lot of things with regard to the Giga 
Factory and expansion of service centers and things like this. Can you share 
any kind of high
-
level thoughts on how we should be expe
cting the 
trajectory of your CapEx, R&D and SG&A as we look beyond this year, just 
maybe some kind of broad ranges into next year?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Rod, we can share more details towards the end of the year as we look 
further out. But clearly given the huge ra
mp
-
up in our deliveries and 
[indiscernible] revenue, we should see a significant improvement in our 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
As we go forward. And then we can provide a little bit more granular 
guidance a
s go further up.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. In the past [indiscernible] we've shown all of our cards, so people 
have kind of gotten used to us showing all of our cards. We're not currently 
showing all our cards.
 
Rod Lache 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. All right. Well, thank 
you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. 
Your line is open.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Hi. Thank you very much. Just a question on the cadence of sales. With the, 
you know, the guide for 
deliveries of 78 for next quarter, it does appear that 
you are going to be starving some demand there certainly, which is going to 
clearly get allocated into the following quarter once the changeover is done. 
But I guess how do you think about just the ris
ks of kind of associated with 
hitting that target? I guess if the math is right, I think you go from 78 to 
13,000. It just seems like an awful big ramp, maybe not in absolute units 
but certainly kind of you think about it almost doubling. So how should we 
think about that and managing that?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. We try to 
--
 
because I agree, it does seem like sort of a crazy leap. 
But we try to address that by pointing out that there's two weeks missing in 
Q3 because of the factory retooling. And those two weeks 
at fairly high 
production. So you can add almost 2,000 units to what Q3 really would be if 
we didn't have that two
-
week interruption.
 
So it would actually be, you know, more like 9,500 units or something like 
that in terms of Q3 deliveries. And then 
it's like, oh, okay, it's much more of 
--
 
you can see how we get from sort of 7,500 to 9,500 to 12,000, 13,000, 
whatever the case may be. That seems 
--
 
the progression is much more 
sensible in that context [indiscernible].
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sac
hs
 
Yeah, it certainly helps us understand in terms of kind of the underlying 
cadence of purchases, if you will. I mean I suppose, even though we're 
talking about deliveries, but I guess the one question I would have is, how 
about in terms of the number of 
service centers and just the logistics of 
actually being able to physically deliver these cars? Is that a constraint or a 
risk in any way, I suppose?
 
Elon Musk
 
No. We actually won't be delivering at the 1,000 or 1,000 plus per week rate 
at the end of Q3.
 
P
atrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay, understood. And then I guess another related question, if you have 
any color on this, is if you just kind of go through what you've laid out there 
and hold the regional delivery rates kind of constant with where the
y came 
in in Q2, I mean most people sort of have those through various sources, it 
does imply again that clearly you're starving one or more regions in Q3 in 
terms of demand that they'd want but can't get. But for Asia, it implies 
something like maybe 5,00
0 to 6,000 units of deliveries, at least on our 
preliminary math.
 
And I guess that's a similar number that you did initially in the U.S. when 
you launched. And is that something that you've got a backlog for already? 
I'm imagining the answer is yes, but wa
s just kind of curious.
 
Elon Musk
 
Demand will not be a problem. Yeah.
 
An interesting little item, like how many stores are we building? Well, we're 
building hardly any. We're building lots of service centers.
 
We can drive demand up at will. But if drive it
 
up too much, then people 
would get upset with us because they waited too long for their car. And the 
only guy in China gets upset that when he got his car, he bashed it, which 
seems [indiscernible] but he said the reason for bashing the car was that we 
to
ok too long to deliver to him. I'm like, okay. But 
--
 
and when I was visiting 
in China, the only unhappiness I saw was that, because customers were 
upset about waiting too long for their car. So it's like, boy, we better not 
stoke demand in that situation.
 
And sales per square foot on our stores, I believe Apple's normally the 
leader on sales per square foot, our sales per square foot are double that of 
Apple's.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
That's a 
--
 
thank you. That's helpful perspective.
 
If I coul
d just ask one more, you know, just building on Rod's question. As 
you think about OpEx, I know you're not giving guidance for next year, 
Deepak, but clearly what you've laid out for your expansion of service and 
distribution, obviously that's an expense t
hat we expect to increase and 
necessarily stead away [ph]. You know, how do we think about just R&D in 
the shorter term? I mean obviously it's fairly elevated. I think the math 
implies more than 400 million this year, if I'm doing it right. Is that 
somethi
ng that takes a little bit of a breather in terms of the growth rate, or, 
you know, just given the significant product ramp you've got, it's something 
we should look to continue to increase 
--
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah. We are doing a lot of product related action
s at this point, and that is 
creating an artificial bump. And especially the Model X and other activities 
that are going on. That will sort of slow down. But then we want to work on 

d
own. I think if there is one place we want to spend money, it's there, and 
do more exciting stuff. So I think we'll just provide information as 
appropriate further on.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. I mean another thing, our CapEx and R&D numbers are better than 
they app
ear because there are things you don't know about.
 
Patrick Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Well, okay. A lot of interesting stuff to look ahead to. Thanks for the color 
guys.

Our next question comes from John Lava
llo with Merrill Lynch. Your line is 
open.
 
John Lavallo 

 
Merrill Lynch
 
Hey guys. Thanks a lot for taking my call here. First question is, I mean 
there's clearly a lot of excitement in anticipation about China. It just seems 
that the Chinese government is 
doing just about everything in their power to 
kind of favor the domestic OEs, I mean whether it's the 10% purchase tax 
avoidance that won't apply to imports, the charging station standards that at 
this point don't seem to be compatible with Tesla's technol
ogy. And even I 
mean they're allowing 
--
 
or thinking of allowing non
-
OEs to have licenses to 
produce autos, including the owner of [Fisk Renee 123] who might be in that 
race.
 
So I guess the question is, I mean, how do you see this kind of 
environment 
developing? I mean do you think there's going to be just increasing pressure 
from the Chinese government to kind of favor the domestic guys?
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually I've been pretty impressed with the Chinese government at all 
levels, the city level
 
and the national level. They're actually 
--
 
I mean they 
have done some political [ph] actions maybe quite a bit in the past, but I 
don't think that's going to be the path going forward for them. And actually 
for the sales tax exemption, it does actually a
pply to non
-
Chinese cars. So I 
think you may be missing a point [ph] there. There are 
--
 
we have to adhere 
to Chinese charging standards, but we are going to do so. But the challenge 
was that those standards weren't defined until about a month ago. So it's
 
a 
little tricky to adhere to something that is not yet definitively been 
announced. Now that it has, we're committed to meet those standards, and 
we expect to fit within the sales tax exemption. Yeah.
 
JB Straubel
 
It's actually a very 
--
 
relatively simple 
matter to meet the Chinese 
standards. They're very familiar and quite close to the European standard.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right. Yeah, exactly. And we're ready to meet the European standard. So as 
we're trying to observe the U.S. standard, the European standards, an
d then 
we'll be observing the China standard which is, as JB said, very similar to 
Europe.
 
John Lavallo 

 
Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, that's very helpful. Sorry, go ahead.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yeah. In Shanghai, we got the exemption plate fees, which is on an 
imported EV,
 
so it's not just for local EVs that those policies are being 
applied. And we are having discussions in other cities where that's a 
possibility too.
 
So I think so far it's been overall a positive reception that we have received, 
so it's been good.
 
Elon Mus
k
 
Yeah. They're genuinely committed to electric cars. And it's not just about 
favoring local manufacturers.
 
John Lavallo 

 
Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, that's helpful. I guess the second question, recently Edmunds put out 
a report on I guess their first year with M
odel S, and obviously everyone has 
their own opinion on this. But there's been a lot of talk about quality in the 
call, and what Edmunds was saying, and you may have read it, is that there 
were something like 28 to 30 service campaigns that were not part o
f the 
regular scheduled maintenance, and because of that they couldn't 
recommend the car. So I mean I'm just curious how you guys might respond 
to that.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, there's definitely some genuine issues we have with the car, but they 
had one of our ea
rly production units, and in fact most of the problems that 
they have encountered there are not present in current cars. We also 
--
 
I 
think this may be ending up being counterproductive, but the service team 
was ultra proactive with the Edmunds car. So the
y would 
--
 
they were doing 
their best to make Edmunds happy, and I think unfortunately that resulted 
in them changing things up, just on the off
-
chance something might go 
wrong.
 
So that drive unit issue that I mentioned earlier were, the drive units 
[indis
cernible] replaced even though it wasn't a drive unit problem, that 
happened with them twice. So, unfortunate sort of case, but I don't think it's 
broadly correct. And it's definitely correct of 
--
 
for cars that are made in like 
the past year.
 
JB Straubel
 
Yeah. If I might add one thing on the drive unit replacements as well, I think 
it's important to note that the drive unit is a very complicated sort of 
assembly of different components, and the pieces that have needed service 
and failed internal to the dri
ve unit are relatively not very expensive. And 
they're being replaced in order for expedience, so they get the car back on 
the road for the customer in the minimum time.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah.
 
JB Straubel
 
But going forward, we're looking at ways to repair them an
d give people 
back their same drive unit very, very quickly, in about the same amount of 
time. If you had to replace your internal combustion engine every time 
something small went wrong 
--
 
Elon Musk
 
--
 
the gasket or something 
--
 
JB Straubel
 
[Indiscernible]
 
Elon Musk
 
It's literally like the sort of small Shim [ph] that I was mentioning is 
equivalent to replacing a minor gasket on an internal combustion engine.
 
JB Straubel
 
Right.
 
Elon Musk
 
And normally you wouldn't get someone a new engine for 
that. But our 
optimization was customer happiness. And so we knew exactly what to do. 
We just wanted to give people back their car right away.
 
JB Straubel
 
Yup.
 
John Lavallo 

 
Merrill Lynch
 
Yeah. Thanks a lot guys.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Just to add from a cost persp
ective, since these are not significant, the 
overall impact on our warranty reserves has not been significant.
 
Elon Musk
 
Right. And we're going to be at it hard core until that car is 10x better than 
any other car on the road.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. 
Your line is open.
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Hey. Thanks for taking my question. As we look ahead to next year, in the 
100,000 unit by the end of next year, is the biggest production increase 
happening 
right now over these two weeks, or is there some other step that 
has to take place next year to get you to that level?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, there is a big step that's expected to occur in Q1 next year which is the 
bring up of the body line, the SX body line. So
 
we've 
--
 
what we did the past 
two weeks is the assembly line where basically the bits get put together. But 
then the body line is where the body itself is welded together, welded and 
bonded together. So it's like the core skeleton of the car is created. A
nd so 
we anticipate probably 
--
 
well, I'm not sure if 
--
 
it may only that we 
--
 
actually 
--
 
sorry, I take it back.
 
We're going to bring the body line up in parallel with the current line. So 
unlike this case with the assembly, we had to 
--
 
we didn't have t
oo complete 
assembly lines, where we had to stop and retool. In the case of new SX body 
line, which is a line that is designed to be capable of 2,500 units a week, 
maybe more than that, conservatively at 2,500 units a week, at a lower cost 
point, we should
 
be able to do that in parallel.
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Got it. And 
--
 
Elon Musk
 
And I should say that 
--
 
another thing that's going to be 
--
 
see a big 
upgrade, really big upgrade, is the paint shops. There are few cases where 
advanced CapEx spending 
makes sense, even though it's going to pay off in 
sort of two to three years, but it's just such a big improvement that you kind 
of want to do it even at a high discount rate. So our paint shop is being 
upgraded. It's going to be the most advanced automoti
ve paint shop in the 
world.
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Got it.
 
Elon Musk
 
But it's expensive to do that.
 
Ben Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
And then we like watching Halle Berry every week, but can you give us any 
details on when we can see the Model X? And 
then there's slightly different 
language about the alpha and beta that I think is new. So could you just tell 
us the difference between what the alpha model and the beta model?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. The X that was produced, the sort of the show [ph] car or advanc
ed 
prototype, is sort of a pre
-
alpha. The alpha itself is, you know, the 
production, it's basically production design. We're going to move very 
quickly from alpha to beta. So in this case, like for the Model S, the alpha 
was a lot more primitive than X wil
l be, because of course we didn't 
--
 
for 
the X we've got all [indiscernible] and powertrain stuff that's been done for 
the S that we can build upon. In the S case, we didn't have that.
 
So it's really a very advanced alpha car that we're producing through t
he X. 
And we'll move to beta within three months. So it's a real fast alpha to beta. 
And you can expect to see production cost, not in customer hands but kind 
of on the road, doing test and validation in Q1 next year. We'll have quite a 
few of those.
 
Ben K
allo 

 
Robert W. Baird
 
Great. Thanks so much.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes 
--
 
Elon Musk
 
And something I do want to emphasize with the X, is because we're moving 
very quickly into a high production mode, as opposed 
--
 
with S, the S had a 
--
 
Model S 
had a long production slope, starting off very slowly and then 
taking kind of six months to reach the 400 unit per week level. In the case 
of the X, I mean we're going to try to move to sort of several hundred units 
a week within three months of production
. So it's like half 
--
 
maybe less 
than half the length. Yeah.
 
But because of that, we really wanted to [indiscernible] validation on the 
car, test the heck out of it before going into volume production.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Coli
n Rush from Northland Capital 
Markets. Your line is open.
 
Colin Rush 

 
Northland Capital Markets
 
Thanks so much guys. I just wanted to make sure I heard these numbers 
right. So we're going from 1,000 to 2,000 cars a week in 2015. So if I take 
the midrange 
of that, about 1,500 cars a week or production levels of 
78,000 cars per year. And if I heard correct on the delivery timeframes, 
you're about two weeks in North America and something like five to six 
weeks overseas which you're trying to shorten up, so we
'd be thinking about 
works in progress of roughly 10%.
 
So are those numbers right in terms of how I'm thinking about kind of 
targets for you guys for next year?
 
Elon Musk
 
It's difficult for us to predict the slope of next year, like 
--
 
so what is the 
slope
, you know, what does the exact curve of the production rise look like 
next year. We feel confident of X ending next year at 2,000 units a week of 
production and demand, absent like some macroeconomic shock. But it's 
hard to say exactly what the area under
 
the curve looks like. But it's, you 
know, yeah, certainly more than 60,000 I would think. But, yeah.
 
Colin Rush 

 
Northland Capital Markets
 
Okay. That's perfect. And then can you talk about the weight reduction 
efforts that you've got going on right now w
ith the vehicles, and how should 
we think about the cadence of pulling weight out of the vehicle and potential 
translation of that into extended range?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, the puzzle [ph] on weight versus range is not super strong. There is an 
improvement but 
it's not a huge improvement. The Model S has gotten 
steadily lighter over time. It's really like, you know, it's quarter a pound 
here, half pound there, but the Model S in production today is at least a few 
hundred pounds less than that in the start of pro
duction. And we'll continue 
to see improvements over time.
 
So to get to a step change on 
--
 
I mean, there are so many pieces in the 
car, like you have the battery pack, the motor 
--
 
the transmission, or the 
gear box, the tires and wheels, the seats. I thin
k if you've got like a big 
improvement any one of those items, maybe with the exception of the 
battery pack, it only changes the weight of the car by like 1%, 2% or 
something. These are all good things, but there's not like one big block 
[indiscernible] si
tting in the car that [indiscernible] more primitive. It 
requires whittling away at a whole bunch of things.
 
JB Straubel
 
And the range impact is, you know, weight is one fraction of impact on 
range, so, even smaller than the direct percentage of weight red
uction.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. And it is getting slightly better over time. It's hard for people to sort of 
perceive it from one month to the next, but if you look at it over the course 
of a year, you'd notice.

11/6/13,Tesla,"Thank you. First of all, I'd like to announce that our CFO, Jason Wheeler, has 
decided to leave Tesla in April, so at the end of next month, to pursue 
opportunities in public policy. Jason will be replaced by Deepak Ahuja, who is 
Tesla's first CFO and 
worked for the company for more than seven years 
before stepping away in 2015. Deepak will formally take over as CFO in early 
March with Jason remaining at Tesla through April to ensure a smooth 
transition.
 
And let's see, Jason, would you like to say anyth
ing?
 
Jason S. Wheeler

Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, sure. First, Elon, thanks for the opportunity.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
Thank you.
 
Jason S. Wheeler

Tesla, Inc.
 
It's been a great ride and I'm really going to miss working with all the 
wonderful people at 
Tesla. This is an A team and when I walked in the door, 
I was very passionate about the mission of the company. And today, I'm 
even more passionate than I was on the day I walked in. And I think it's also 
important to say, that I'm looking to scratch an it
ch that I've had for many, 
many years now. I'm going to go do something in the public sector, but I 
wouldn't have felt comfortable about leaving if we didn't have a really good 
plug
-
and
-
play solution in place for the company. And I think with Deepak's 
hist
ory here, on the verge of bankruptcy and everything that he's gone 
through, he's well positioned to 
-
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
A long time ago.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
A long time ago. A long, long time ago. He's well positioned to take it to t
he 
next level of growth and I've spent a good amount of time with him in the 
past week, and he's super energized and ready to go. He's a great leader, 
and I think I leave Tesla in good hands.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
All right. And, Jason, thank you a
gain for everything you have done.
 
Jason S. Wheeler

Question

and

And our first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan 
Stanley. Your line i
s now open.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
First, good luck Jason, and congrats, Deepak. Welcome back. So, Elon, a 
question for you on Mars. Let's kick it off with Mars, okay?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Really?
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Yes, it has Tesla relevance, though, so just bear with me.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I admire long
-
term thinking, but it's impressive.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Well, numerous reports have suggested the new 
administration may be in 
favor of accelerating a mission to send humans to Mars. I'm curious if you 
think this is accurate in spirit. And if launched, how could this potentially 
change your balance of time spent between Tesla and SpaceX? Could it 
potential
ly change the rationale of keeping Tesla and SpaceX as independent 
companies? And this is a serious question, Elon.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Okay, well, yes. When you started out, I was a little curious as to how this 
would become relevant to Tesla. B
ut, as I said before, I expect to remain 
with Tesla essentially forever, unless somebody kicks me out. So, that 
remains my intention. And I have been pursuing the Mars thing at SpaceX 
and sustainable energy at Tesla for a long time, simultaneously. So, I t
hink 
we've got into a pretty good rhythm, and, yes, I certainly don't think I'm 
going to change my actions as a result of an initiative by administration. 
Although I think a Mars mission would be amazing and really energize the 
public, domestically and wor
ldwide, just as the Apollo mission to the Moon 
did almost half a century ago. So, yes, that's probably the most I can say 
about that, yes.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
As far as I can.
 
Adam Micha

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. Thank you. Just a follow
-
up. On insurance, if your cars prove to 
be as much as 90% safer than other cars on a per mile basis, as I think 
you've alluded as a reasonable target medium
-
term, and if insurance 
comp
anies only offer your customers, say, like a piddling 5% discount 
versus a comparably priced car, would you consider offering a service or 
product like P&C insurance directly to Tesla owners from your own platform 
and your own stores? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Mu
sk

Tesla, Inc.
 
Jon, do you want to take that?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Hey, Adam, it's Jon. We're actually currently doing that. And we've been 
doing it quietly. But in Asia in particular, where we started this, now the 
majority of Tesla cars are s
old with an insurance product that is customized 
to Tesla. It takes into account not only this autopilot safety features, but 
also the maintenance cost of the car. So, it's our vision in the future that 
we'll be able to offer a single price for the car, ma
intenance, and insurance, 
in a really compelling offering for the consumer. And we're currently doing 
that today.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, and this is not to the exclusion of insurance providers, but I mean, if we 
find that insurance providers ar
e not matching the insurance proportionate 
to the rest of the car then, if we need to, we will in
-
source (7:12) it, but I 
think we'll find that insurance providers do adjust the insurance costs 
proportionate to the risk of a Tesla.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
Tesla
, Inc.
 
That's true, that's true. We're doing this with insurance partners today.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

And our next 
question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with 
Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
David Tamberrino

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thanks. Good evening, gentlemen.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Good afternoon. Evening for you, I'm sure. But, yes.
 
David Tam
berrino

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Well, it's been a long day for me. It'll be a long night. Curious as to what has 
changed on your end. Obviously, you got a 

 
made an acquisition. You've 
hired a individual (7:56) in manufacturing from last year, but really mov
ing 
from the Model S and Model X to the Model 3 ramp that you're looking for in 
the back half of 2017 here and into 2018, how have you gone about the 
Model 3 development differently, versus the Model S and Model X, that will 
really be able to unlock the ke
y to driving production much higher than what 
your previous ramps have looked like for new products?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right. The Model 3 is designed with 

 
it's really designed for manufacturing. 
It's considerably a simpler car than the Model 
S or the Model X. Some of 
these allocations (8:40) are obvious. For example, the Model 3 only has one 
screen, whereas the Model S and Model X have two screens, and two 
separate computers powering each screen. The Model 3 has 1.5 kilometers 
of wiring. The M
odel S has three kilometers of wiring, so we simplified the 
wiring system considerably. A lot of the bells and whistles that are present 
on a Model S and Model X are not present on a Model 3. So, we don't have 
self
-
presenting door handles, for example, or 
falcon
-
wing doors.
 
These reduce the risk substantially in the ramp, and make it just easier to 
scale. So, I think it's going to be a very compelling car, but it's just a simpler 
design and we also understand manufacturing a lot better than we did in the 
pa
st, and we're also able to get usually the A team at the A supplier for 
Model 3. It's rare that we're not able to get that, whereas, particularly for 
Model S and to some degree for Model X, when we were trying to get 
suppliers for Model S, a lot of the top
 
tier suppliers wouldn't even work with 
us (10:07). They thought we'd go bankrupt.
 
And the IHS (10:15) basically, the industry predictor for volume of the Model 
S had an official prediction of 3,000 units lifetime for the Model S. And for a 
lot of the big 
supplier, particularly the large sort of conglomerate suppliers, 
they just plug that number into their predictions. They ignore what we say, 
and then they say, well, the volume is either too small to count or the 
(10:47) cost is enormous, because the fixed
 
cost must be allocated over 
such a small volume.
 
Now, in fact, we are building something on the order of 50,000 Model Ses 
per year. And so, having shown the results of the Model S and the Model X, 
the interest from suppliers went from basically getting li
ke the worst team 
on second tier suppliers to getting the best team on first tier suppliers. 
Really a big difference.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Got it. Okay. And then just following up on that, as I think about reduced 
complexity of the vehicl
e, understood, from a actual line speed 
manufacturing perspective, for the Model 3, what are you doing differently 
than the manufacturing process that is going to allow you to drive that ramp 
in production? As I think about 50,000 units Model S doing on an
 
annual 
basis, it's good, it's great. You've been making that vehicle for the last three 
years, four years.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right. As opposed to, yes, an annualized rate of 250,000, five times that 
number for Model 3. That's a reasonable ques
tion to ask. There's just a lot 
more automation than there is for Model S and Model X. We have the 
Gigafactory, of course. That's a huge asset for factory powertrain, power 
electronics, chargers, and a few other things. So, that's a huge asset. And 
yes, so
, also I've refocused most of Tesla engineering, including design 
engineering into designing the factory. I think in the future, the factory will 
be a more important product than the car itself.
 
I've said this before, but our goal is to be the best manufac
turer on Earth. 
This is our real goal. I don't know if we will succeed, but I think we're 
making good progress in that direction. And that's 

 
yes. It's really (13:20) 
the factory as just an enormous product with at least (13:27) more complex 
than whatever
 
it makes (13:31).
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, I might just add that we've really learned a lot of lessons, especially 
from the difficult Model X ramp. That's something that's in our recent 
memory. And we fought through it and succeeded. But I t
hink in the design 
of the Model 3 and the systems in the lines that produce it, many of those 
learnings have been incorporated from the beginning. So, the amount of 
complexities in the operations to assemble the car is dramatically reduced, 
the amount of o
perations that involve (14:03) where there's more judgment 
of the operator, is dramatically reduced, almost eliminated.
 
And a lot of these things that we could identify directly as the bottlenecks 
that hurt us on the Model X ramp, we've been able to target
 
specifically and 
reduce or eliminate. So that has, though painful, it was a very helpful 
experience for us to get ready for Model 3.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. I do want to emphasize with production ramps in general that they 
follow an S curve. So
, the rate of production is as fast as the slowest 
component in the vehicle. And when you have several thousand unique 
items, it can move as (14:47) fast as the least likely and worst executing 
part of Tesla or our suppliers. That's just the way it goes. S
o, you're going 
through a series of constraints. You try to anticipate as many as possible the 
newer issues that pop up every week and then we attack them and get them 
(15:17) schedule.
 
But then another issue will pop up in the following week. So, it's sch
edule 
whack
-
a
-
mole. And if we knew what would be late now, we would've 
attacked it. But some of these things only come to light late in the game. 
And when you have a global supply chain, you inherit a lot of force majeure 
risk from around the world. And so
, it's one of the things that I think we 
want to do is just minimize force majeure risk.
 
If you inherit, like, every force majeure risk on Earth, then, of course, things 
are going to go wrong, because Earth is big. So, I think we're going to 
increasingly o
ver time rationalize our supply chain to minimize the force 
majeure risk. It's very important. But yes, it's always tricky being a public 
company, reporting on a quarterly basis. Even small differences in where 
that exponential part of the S curve is, can 
make quite a big impact on a 
quarter. (16:38) moving around an exponential curve, just small changes 
here and there have quite a big effect. And then things get more predictable 
as you get to the flat part of the S curve, the top of the S curve.
 
That's why it's a lot (16:56) easier to predict, say, what things would be 
next year or the end of this year as opposed to what they'd be month by 
month this year.

And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Ryan Brinkman

Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just regarding the explanation in th
e 
shareholder letter that you experienced a little autopilot revenue, a little new 
revenue in 4Q, can you talk about what delayed the software updates into 
1Q? Was it the switch from Mobileye in any way? And then talk about how 
the current capabilities of 
autopilot in 1Q in terms of performance and 
safety, how that's better than maybe what was offered previously?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, we had some challenges in the transition from Mobileye to Tesla 
software running on GPU. Our original plan was 
to have a migration 
strategy, where we have Mobileye and Tesla Vision operating at the same 
time to have kind of a smooth process, but Mobileye refused to do that. So, 
that poised (18:16) us to re
-
spin the board and caused unexpected delays 
where we had to
 
basically (18:22) from the board and just kind of (18:26) 
Tesla Vision.
 
Safety is always our primary concern. So, really we could have released 
Tesla Vision and including (18:42) high speed, probably three months ago 

 
I was driving at a high speed person
ally three months ago, but I think we 
want to just have an exhaustive testing process, vetting (18:57) process 
before enabling that throughout the fleet.
 
So, we've been edging our way up there gradually. Now, longitudinal 
control, the Traffic
-
Aware Cruise 
Control is at 80 miles an hour. And 
Autosteer is at 50 miles an hour, and I think we should be able to get, 
unless testing shows something different, we should be able to get them 
both to around the maybe 85 miles an hour next month and be at parity 
with H
ardware 1 (19:36). And then obviously things will only improve from 
there. So, that's that.

(19:45) last question on the $500 million cash generation outlook, including 
growth of non
-
recourse debt, how much of that r
elates to the automotive 
operations versus SolarCity or maybe you probably don't want to break it 
out that way. Just how are you thinking about the contribution from, like, 
tax equity funding versus maybe call it combined, like, Tesla SolarCity, like, 
ongo
ing operations?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure, yes. So, this is Jason. So, (20:11) commitment that we made when 
we closed the deal was on the Solar side. So that's what the $500 million 
relates to. And that's going to come from a number of factors. O
ne of the 
things we're already starting to see great traction on is a shift away from 
reasoned systems (20:25) to doing loans and cash sales of systems. We 
provided some information in the letter about that. That's going well. And 
we've also done that on t
he vehicle side, it's worth noting.
 
And then the other thing is as part of the acquisition, we committed to $150 
million in synergies. And some of that cash generation is obviously going to 
come from going after those synergies. And we're on track to go ge
t that. 
We've got lots of opportunities on customer acquisition cost. Tesla has a 
very strong global brand. We've got a great retail footprint. So, we've got 
the pieces in place to really drive customer acquisition cost down. And then 
obviously on the manu
facturing side as well, we're rethinking through what 
that's going to do for us and how we can drive cost savings there as well.

And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital 
Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. First question, I guess, relates to the delivery guidance, which I 
know you limited to the first half. 
But, as we think about the full year and 
the back half and the launch of the Model 3, is there the potential for a 
disruption to Model S and Model X. Is that also one of the factors why you've 
sort of decided to sort of guide the way you did?
 
Elon Reeve Mu
sk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Do you want to?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, sure. I think the way we're thinking about that is there's going to be 
pretty high bars on the (22:08) delivery for Model 3 in the second half of the 
year. And I think Elon 
described that well when he talked about the S curve. 
So, we didn't want to muddy our guidance by doing some kind of a 
combined number for the year. And obviously, execution on Model X and 
Model S and execution on getting ready for Model 3 in the first hal
f is what's 
important. And those are the things that we really want to point investors to 
in how we're measuring ourselves.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's sort of calculating the area under the curve is tricky when you're in an 
exponential. And it alwa
ys starts out tiny and then spools up. Well, it spools 
up exponentially, but generally people have trouble wrapping their minds 
around an exponential, the natural tendency is to extrapolate on the straight 
line. And so, that's why it was important to empha
size that this is 

 
the 
spool up is an exponential. It kind of does get into a linear zone, and then it 
goes into a logarithm, (23:14).
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And then well, I guess, just to follow on that, I was wondering if you guys 
would 
be willing to indicate when you think configuration for the Model 3 
would open? But separately also, Elon, there's been a lot of news or noise 
around unionization at Fremont. And I was wondering if you guys could give 
a little bit of color on your views of
 
potentially unionization and if it did 
occur, sort of how that changes the cost structure?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. Well, there is obviously quite a strong effort by UAW to unionize Tesla. 
And actually a lot of people at Tesla who have been app
roached by UAW 
have expressed concerns about this. And there were also a number of claims 
made by someone who I think is de facto an employee for UAW, but at 
Tesla. And there's one piece and probably (24:22) published in the next day 
or two days, because I
 
wanted to make sure I fully investigated the claims 
before writing a (24:28).
 
But, the fact of the matter is that over the last few months, Tesla's injury 
rate is less than half of the industry average, contrary to the allegations 
made. And the compensati
on, if you look at somebody who started four 
years ago, the vesting period for Tesla stock is four years. So if you said, 
what is the outcome for somebody who started four years ago, it is by far 
the highest in the auto industry.
 
There was an allegation th
at people were underpaid at Tesla, but in fact, 
they are the highest paid in the industry, if you include the equity, which 
obviously you should include. So, there are really only disadvantages for 
someone to want the UAW here. I mean the track record is w
orse of every 
other company.

And our next question comes from the line of 
John Murphy with Bank of 
America. Your line is now open.
 
Aileen Elizabeth Smith 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Good afternoon, guys. This is Aileen Smith on for John. First, and a more 
high level question. I realize it's still very early days in terms of 
the new 
Trump administration, but with Scott Pruitt now head of the EPA, are you 
anticipating any changes with respect to the oversight or regulations under 
CARB and its relationship to the EPA?
 
Elon, is that coming up in your meetings with the Trump team 
at all, or any 
of the discussions? And how would you respond in the event that regulations 
and standards or the potential to generate the credits were to be altered?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure, well, it's only come up briefly. And my response is th
at, I think it will 
be fine to get rid of incentives and subsidies, but that should be uniformly 
applied to all industries. It would obviously be wrong to get rid of any sort of 
government intervention in sustainable energy while retaining it in fossil 
fue
ls. But if the principle is to get rid of government intervention, that 
should be uniformly applied, not unfairly applied. So, that's the only thing. 
That was my comments, but there was no response given. They listened to 
that. And that's how I feel.
 
And a
s I mentioned on our prior call, the reality actually is that, if electric 
vehicle incentives went away tomorrow, Tesla's competitive position would 
improve. Part of the reason why GM is able to sell the Bolt at the price that 
they are able to do, while on
 
paper making a loss, is that their ZEV credits 
are worth twice as much as they are to Tesla, because they get the full retail 
value of their credits, which is worth about $10,000 more to them than it is 
to Tesla.
 
We get basically $0.50 on the $1 when we c
an sell the ZEV credits, which is 
not always. Last quarter, we were able to sell only a tiny amount of ZEV 
credits, because the ZEV mandate is just already really weak. So, the irony 
is, getting rid of it would actually improve our competitive position. An
d the 
ZEV credits only apply to 14 states in the U.S., (28:23) 14. They don't apply 
internationally. And then things like the federal tax credit for electric vehicles 
caps out at, I think, a few hundred thousand cars. And we're not far from 
that point. So,
 
basically, credits either don't scale to high volume or they're 
disadvantageous to Tesla.
 
Even in California, which is our home state, California legislature put an 
income cap on anyone who could get the California tax credit for EVs, which 
then excluded 
a whole bunch of our customers, which I think is 
counterproductive to the biggest manufacturing player in California. Why the 
hell the legislature did that, I do not know. But it was harmful to the state.
 
Aileen Elizabeth Smith

Bank of America Merrill Ly
nch
 
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then sort of a second question, you guys 
gave some helpful disclosure in terms of the vehicle order growth for the 
Model S and the Model X in the quarter. Can you talk about the order growth 
for the Model 3? The last me
asurement that we received on the size of the 
wait list or the order book was 400,000, plus or minus. Can you talk about 
how that's grown over the past few quarters, I mean if we look at the 
customer deposits on your balance sheet, it actually declined seq
uentially 
from 3Q to 4Q. So how much, if any of that, is related to the Model 3?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, sure, so this is Jason. It's not related to the Model 3. We still had a 
number of Signature Series Model X reservations, where there was 
just a 
higher deposit required for those cars, and we were able to deliver a number 
of those in Q4. So that's the primary driver behind the total reported 
decrease in the customer deposits line.
 
Aileen Elizabeth Smith 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. 
And can you give any size of the order book for the Model 3 as it 
stands right now?
 
Jason S. Wheeler

And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Your 
line is now open.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Oh, great. Elon, in the press release, you give comments on margin
s for the 
first half of the year. Any broad color on how we should think about margins 
in the second half, particularly as the Model 3 launches? I mean will that be 
profitable day one, or is that going to take some time for that to ramp? Any 
color there?
 
E
lon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(31:05) that it will not be profitable on day one, because of that exponential 
issue that I mentioned. The early Model 3s will be horribly negative margin, 
particularly on day one, when I say literally day one. Because you're s
tarting 
at a tiny, tiny rate, as you spool up this giant machine. So, it's 

 
like, no 
company on Earth could 

 
it's not a function of Tesla. It is like physically 
impossible. So, you have to get the production rate to some reasonable 
capacity percentage of
 
the system.
 
If the capacity of the production system is X, until you are at least like half 
X, your gross margin is going to be weak, and it's going to be terrible when 
you're like an order of magnitude below, or if you're 10% of X, or less. It's 
going to
 
be terrible. But then it'll get really good as you start to approach 
100% capacity. Like, then it gets great. And then, as we get to the initial 
phase of capacity of 5,000 a week, I would expect to see gross margins 
comparable to that of the Model S and M
odel X.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
So, in the next year that you should get to the 5,000 per week, is that right?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, I feel pretty confident that we should get there by the end of this year, 
to 5,000 a week. 
Now, I do want to separate this from parts orders. I know 
a number of our suppliers are listening. It's impossible to keep 

 
like nothing 
is a secret these days, it seems. Yes. It's like major intelligence 
organizations cannot keep a secret. It's like, rea
lly 

 
I don't know who can, 
honestly. So, when we place parts orders with our suppliers, we've told them 
1,000 a week in July, 2,000 a week in August, and 4,000 a week in 
September. These are parts orders. Then the parts need to arrive. They 
need to be tur
ned into a car. And the car needs to be delivered to 
customers.
 
None of these things occur instantaneously. And we have what I call, like, 
maybe the term paper problem of, like, I was a teaching assistant in college. 
And no matter what date we set the exam
 
paper for, when the term paper 
was due, there's always like some number of people that are late. It's just 
the way it goes. People sometimes 

 
well, and I'm guilty of this too. Like too 
optimistic about the timing or they get unlucky or something like tha
t.
 
So, we have to set these really strict dates, then some number of people are 
late, but it only has to be (34:27) 1%, and then we either have to make 
those parts manually at great cost or slow down the production rate. And 
when I say great cost, when you
 
make something manually as opposed to 
through mass production, it can be 10 times, 20 times, 30 times more than 
a part that's handmade as opposed to made with high volume production 
equipment.
 
So, that's essentially 

 
I'm trying to give you, like, what's 
the problem space 
look like in my head so that you can at least try to model it. You know what 
I know. And if I knew which 1% of suppliers it was, right now, I would 
honestly take action. But I don't because I don't know who's going to be 
unlucky. I don't 
know who's being really optimistic. But the 1,000, 2,000, 
4,000, those are the deadlines we've set out for our suppliers for parts 
delivery and then parts get made into cars, cars need to get delivered. 
Those are three separate steps.
 
Colin Michael 
Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Great. And one last 

 
I just have 

 
my last question is just any color on cash 
burn? And I think last time you mentioned that you were confident you 
wouldn't need a capital raise. Do you still feel that way? I mean, I think it 
w
as close to $1 billion on the quarter and it sounds like CapEx is going to 
rise next year. How should we think about cash burn cadence and the 
(35:59) no capital raise going forward? Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, so this is really a questi
on of what's the risk tolerance of the company, 
or how close to the edge do we want to go. According to our financial plan, 
no capital needs to be raised for the Model 3, but we get very close to the 
edge. So, then that's probably not the best thing for sh
areholders on a risk 
adjusted basis. So, we're considering a number of options, but I think it 
probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce risk.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Got it. All right. Thank you very much for the color.
 
Jason S. Wh
eeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Colin, I just wanted to add a couple of points there too.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
On the cash receive end, we see $1 billion in cash burn, but I don't think 
that's fully 
accurate. We had $522 million in CapEx, so we're investing at a 
very healthy rate ahead of what we need to do for Model 3. And then there 
were certainly some timing differences. We talked about in our deliveries 
press release, we had 2,750 cars that we mis
sed delivering them by a couple 
of days. So, I think there's a little cross quarter timing going on there. And 
it's not indicative of what cash flow from operations is going to look like in 
the future.
 
Another, to circle back to your point and one of the q
uestions from earlier, 
about what's different about Model 3, I thought maybe I'll provide just a 
little bit more color on costing, and this will help you think a little bit about 
margins on a go
-
forward basis too. From the very beginning of the Model 3 
pro
gram, the costing of the car was front and center and has always been a 
key part of the conversation and the decisions that have been made. And it 
goes all the way back to first principles as Elon likes to talk about.
 
On a part
-
by
-
part basis, we've been lo
oking at what is the value of the 
commodities in that part with a reasonable cost to fabricate the part and 
what's a reasonable margin on top of it. And that's the starting point for 
costing for everything that's gone into the Model 3. The other thing that
's 
important, and we've talked about this a lot over the past couple of quarters 
is just being more efficient with our capital spend, and JB's done a fabulous 
job with this up at the Gigafactory. I don't know if you had a chance to 
attend the event or not,
 
but the volumetric efficiency there is quite stunning.
 
And if you can be (38:44) more in a smaller footprint, the capital required is 
less, and the less capital that's required to do things, the less the 
depreciation load is going to be on each unit produ
ced once you get to 
volume, production and deliveries. So, (38:58) I thought it would be good to 
add that additional color to your comments and your questions.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. Thanks very much.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, it's sort of applying the rocket equation to manufacturing. And it's, yes, 
volume 

 
essentially 

 
well, on the rocket equation, it's taking its mass 
efficiency, but like volumetric efficiency of the factory as Jason was 
mentioning and then exit veloci
ty of product from the factory, kind of just 
slow it down (39:29) pretty much just to those two things.

And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson wi
th Barclays. 
Your line is now open.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes, good afternoon. Just a few questions about the cash flow and CapEx 
and cash needs. First, I recognize that you're now consolidating in SolarCity, 
but if you were just to ver
y roughly give us what the old automotive 
adjusted cash flow was and try to kind of disentangle that from the cash flow 
coming out of the former SolarCity, what would that roughly look like 
directionally?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. So, I think we
 
put in our letter the cash generation was about $70 
million. So, SolarCity was actually a cash generator for the five
-
week sub
-
period. Some of that was the cash in tax equity deals closing. So, the way to 
think about SolarCity on a go
-
forward basis, prior
itizing cash generation 
stroke preservation over the near
-
term for that business. So, I don't 
anticipate any significant 

 
it's not going to have a significant impact on our 
cash position in future quarters.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. And secondly, the $2 billion to $2.5 billion CapEx guide that's spent 
(40:58), does that imply that that's not a full 

 
a couple of questions, does 
that imply that's not a full year 2017 number given that production cadence 
that you're planning?
 
Jaso
n S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Correct. That's between now and start of the production for Model 3.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. And second, can you talk a little bit more about the deferral of cash 
out for CapEx due to agreements with suppl
iers or some of those equipment 
suppliers to defer payments? Just what are those agreements? Where does 
that liability show up on the balance sheet? And then is that a hard as soon 
as they deliver a proof part? Does that come due or how does the actual 
tim
ing of that payment work?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, sure, absolutely. So, I think this is one of the benefits of having a very 
successful run over the last couple of years. We have developed a lot of trust 
with our suppliers. So, when I started, 
(41:59), what's our average days 
payables outstanding? And it was lower than it should be. And we've been 
able to renegotiate payment terms with just about everybody and stretch 
out those payables. And it's not a question of (42:12) paying. It's actually 
w
e have trust and we're going with renegotiating these contracts with 
suppliers. And I believe we shared this data point last quarter on the call.
 
But, for the parts that have been sourced for Model 3 so far, the average 
payment turns is 59 days. So, cash c
onversion cycle is something that we 
care deeply about and we're paying a lot of attention to. And obviously as 
we head up this S curve that we've talked about, working capital is going to 
be very important. So we're going to have to keep a good eye on tha
t.
 
To sum it up, we're making great progress in stretching out our payables, 
and we're doing it in a way that I think is productive and healthy with the 
relationships with our suppliers and vendors.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. So, those
 
deferred capital expenditure payments are actually in the 
accounts payable or is it in more like an accrued liability line? Just 
housekeeping.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It depends on if there's 

 
many payments have milestones set to them. So, 
when th
e piece of equipment is actually installed and up and running. And 
until you hit that milestone, you won't see a payable.

Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Great. Thank you, and good afternoon. And let me just add my 
congratulations to Jason and best of luck. And welcome back to Deepak. I
f I 
may quickly, Elon, you mentioned in response to a ZEV question earlier, the 
14 states, I believe it was, that sort of share these standards and allow 
manufacturers to sort of earn credits, buy credits, allow you to sell credits 
and so forth, understand
ing that to the extent that a competitor vehicle is 
sold in California, it counts toward their quota, if you will, in other states. 
And that the waiver that allows that might be expiring later this year, and 
I'm just wondering, number one, if that's correc
t, if I'm thinking about that 
the right way and how that would theoretically impact your business?
 
You've talked about how if sort of these $7,500 federal 

 
and I know I'm 
mixing ZEV and GHG and so forth, but you talked about how it could 
theoretically be 
a competitive advantage for Tesla. And I'm just wondering if 
you could sort of opine on that
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, it's just that in order to scale, it's just that that mandate is so weak. 
It's like less than 1% or some tiny number of vehicle
s made in the ZEV 
states, or sold in the ZEV states. So we're the only ones who currently make 
a car in California. And I do think California maybe should do a bit more to 
support its only remaining auto manufacturer for us to be competitive. Yes, 
it's wei
rd that they seem to do more to support non
-
California companies 
than Tesla. But this mandate becomes irrelevant at scale. Tesla will have 
more ZEV credits than the rest of the U.S. industry combined.
 
So, the value of them just drops to a negligible number
. And then they don't 

 
since the mandate is so weak, like, the manufacturers don't really need to 
sell them either because they make whatever their puny (45:58) amount of 
electric vehicles are, 20,000 cars maybe. We're making 20 times, 30 times 
that numbe
r. So, these things are just 

 
they're just not important at scale 
because the mandate is too weak.
 
James J. Albertine 
-

Yes, understood. I was just sort of getting at the fact that maybe if the bulk 
sale in California doesn't co
unt toward New York or something, that it's 
actually weaker, it's tougher for your competitors than it even is today. So 
that's more what I was alluding to. And I agree with you that the mandates 
don't make a lot of sense.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, they're just very weak, so they will have almost no impact on Model 3, 
like maybe for a few quarters. That's about it.
 
James J. Albertine

Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Okay, great. And if I may on the Model 3 quickly and then I'll get back in 
queue, th
e vehicle we've seen, is that a preproduction version, or is that the 
version you plan to fully produce? And if not, when could we maybe expect 
to see the fully sort of finished product, just to get an idea of, you alluded to 
at the Gigafactory a couple of
 
months ago, there's still some suppliers that 
you want to make sure you're lining up properly to get everything ready to 
go for July 1. And I'm wondering if the reviewing of the final production
-
ready version could be between now and then sort of an addit
ional catalyst?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, I'm not sure if it's going to make sense for us to show the final version 
before start of production or after. The initial cars, sort of Founder Series, 
actually go to company employees, because I think it
's important for us to 
have a good feedback loop (48:01) on the product that we're making. And if 
there are any issues, bugs or things that need to be addressed that we can 
address those before customers experience them.
 
So, I think in terms of showing the
 
final version, it's probably at least a few 
months away, maybe as far as July itself. It's going to be pretty close to 
what I showed at the Model 3 unveiling, but with more polish and refinement 
and a few more details that are added. So it'll be better th
an (48:44) what 
was unveiled and I guess in some ways it will be a lot better.

An
d our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. 
Your line is now open.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Thanks so much. Given the dependency on the Model 3 profitability on the 
Gigafactory, can you talk about timing for a full
 
ramp on both anode and 
cathode assembly? And then I have a follow
-
up question on the debt that 
you drew down in the fourth quarter.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I'm sorry. You mean the full ramp to what level? To the 35 gigawatt
-
hours 
per year or...
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
No, no. This is a modular facility, right? So you've got machines up and 
running, so just the first tranche of equipment that you've installed. When is 
that going to be up and running at full capacity?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
They're very big modules.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, they're pretty large increments. But those will be up and running at the 
full capacity for the first instances within just a few months. We're already in 
the stages of 

 
we'll b
e doing the second instance of anode and cathode 
electrode assembly. So, these are needed for the ramp of Model 3. So you 
can get a sense of the timing here.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, I mean, it's two big modules, if you will, I guess, in that sen
se, right? 
Something like that.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
So we can think about that being kind of done in the second quarter, done, 
is what I'm hearing you say. And then...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, 
Inc.
 
The first module and then 

 
if you're not 

 
module is a little confusing term, 
because we actually have a module, the (50:34) is divided into sales 
modules and packs.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
First instance of the electrode manufacturing line
.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
First line, line one, if you will. It should be in the next few months operating.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, and that first instance would be achieving full volume in Q3.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Okay. Great. And then on the $969 million that you've got in the bucket of 
debt activities, can you talk about where, just break down where that debt 
came from and how much borrowing capacity you have entering the year 
with your current facilities?
 
Jason S
. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, so the debt activity just comes from draws on our asset
-
backed line and 
our warehouse lines. We've got a lot of cash in transit, as we move through 
the quarters, particularly at the end of the quarters or making deliveries. So,
 
we just want to make sure we have maximum liquidity as we close out 
quarters.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, it's particularly (51:39) essentially that's almost entirely finished 
product in transit to a customer, and to a known customer. So, it's not 
general corporate debt. It's just, like we finished the car, and it's got to be 
transported to a customer overseas, and it may take four weeks to eight 
weeks to get there.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
That's right. And then that cash has been largely rea
lized (52:07).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. Yes, exactly.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Okay. And so, how can we think about borrowing capacity at this point on a 
go
-
forward basis?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, we still had incremental c
apacity at the end of the quarter. We made 
some announcements on this. We've increased our warehouse lines, which is 
a way for us to pull cash forward (52:28) portfolios. And it's gone from zero 
earlier in the year to $300 million, and then we added anothe
r $300 million. 
So we've got $600 million in capacity there. And our ABL has gone from 
$750 million at the beginning of the year to $1 billion to $1.2 billion. So, as 
we continue to build assets, we've got this ability to use them to bring cash 
forward.
 
El
on Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
And that's separate from general borrowing capacity.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, it's non

recourse debt.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes.

And our next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank with Robert Baird. 
Your line is now open.
 
Tyler Charles Frank

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Elon,
 
I guess this is for you. Taking 
a step back and looking at the bigger picture, you previously talked about 
producing 1 million units per year by 2020, and that 500,000 units in 2018. 
How confident are you now in both of those targets? And does anything ne
ed 
to be done from the battery perspective side in order to reach those targets? 
Would you need to build another Gigafactory prior to hitting 1 million units 
per year in 2020, or do you think that the current Gigafactory will have 
enough capacity?
 
Elon Ree
ve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, (53:55) you've seen the average pack sizes, but if you say it's 
somewhere around the 60
-
kilowatt
-
hour to 70
-
kilowatt
-
hour level, then you 
need 70 gigawatt
-
hours to get to 1 million units. And we think that's the sell 
(54:17) leve
l. And then we think the current Gigafactory should actually be 
able to do in excess of 100 gigawatt
-
hours. So, that leaves 

 
probably a big 

 
Gigafactory 1 can manage 

 
can support 

 
it can support probably 1 
million vehicles a year, plus maybe something 
like 30 gigawatt
-
hours or so 
of storage, depending upon how fast the storage market grows. But really, I 
think the storage market's probably going to grow maybe twice the rate of 
the automotive business. Something like that.
 
Tyler Charles Frank 
-
 
Robert W.
 
Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth

Okay. So, are you still on track, do you believe, for 1 million vehicles in 2020 
and 500,000 in 2018? And then, as a quick follow
-
up to Model 3, you had 
previously talked about 20% gross margin on that. When d
o you think that 
margin target will be able to be achieved?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. I currently think that we should build to 500,000 vehicles next year and 
1 million vehicles by 2020. That's 500,000 vehicles in total, Model S, Model 
3, and Mode
l X combined next year should 

 
as far as the information I have 
at my disposal right now, I believe that is the most likely outcome. And 
then, with a couple more years, getting to 1 million units. That seems also 
the most likely outcome. Yes.

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth

up. Obviously, with Jason leaving, it

should we think of this as a permanent situ
ation? Or, how should we be

Yes, Deepak has come back in a long

term role. So this is not an interim

Hi. Thank you very much. Just wondering if I could ask a little more about 
the CapEx. I know you're talking about sort of CapEx up until Model 3, but 
can you give us any kind of breakout for maybe, even just in percentage 
terms, looking throughout the year, how much CapEx you're thinking for 
Model 3 versus Gigafactory and versus 
Solar?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. So, we don't break down (57:23) disclose the specifics here, but 
obviously Gigafactory and Model 3 are going to be the biggest investments. 
We've also got CapEx investments in equipment and tooling related to Mod
el 
3, but then also there's going to be a piece in CapEx on building out our 
service and our retail infrastructure as well, and the Supercharger network. 
So it's the usual suspects.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And solar glass. The solar glass tiles.
 
Robe
rt Cihra 
-
 
Guggenheim Securities LLC
 
Yes, so if I could just ask one more. So on that solar glass tile, I mean, does 
that 

 
you are looking to start production, I guess, whatever, later this year 
or ramp capacity. I mean, is that a meaningful amount of Cap
Ex for that or, 
relatively speaking, is it not?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Relatively speaking, it's not.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, it's pretty modest.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(58:15) insane numbers for Model 3, Gigafactory, they 
look cute by 
comparison.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And we'll be scaling that in the Buffalo Tesla solar factory. So it's helpful that 
that facility already exists. So we don't have to invest in CapEx for a new 
factory or something like this. And also,
 
frankly, a lot of the equipment 
already exists and is already purchased. So it's (58:46) minor.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, it's...
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
But it will ramp and start scaling at the end of this year.

Single digit percentage of the Model 3 CapEx.
 
Robert Cihra

All right. Great. Thanks. And then, if I could just ask a quick follow
-
up. I 
think someone started to ask it earlier, but I don't think it was answered, 
which was j
ust if you knew when 

 
or well I'm sure you know. If we knew 
when you were going to start opening customer configurations for Model 3?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Probably going to be pretty close to production. We'll open it internally. So, 
the first ca
rs will go to Tesla employees and investors and whatnot and so 
forth, so that we can experience any challenges before our customers do. So 
we'll obviously do it internally sooner than we would do it externally. So I 
think it's probably three months or four
 
months away.

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Hey, good afternoon. I appreciate you squeezing me in. Two quick ones. 
One, was there a solar securitization in the quarter? And if so, how large was 
it? And then two, Elon, I believe at the Gigafactory event on January 4,
 
you 
mentioned that there was some equipment, stamping tools and whatnot that 
needed to be put in place in Fremont. I was just curious, A, if those showed 
up, and then, B, if you can just update us on what needs to be done from 
just a physical capacity to 
make the vehicle in July?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Quick answer here, no, there's no securitization in Q4. There's one in Q1.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, and we're busy pulling out (60:50) the stamping facility right now. The 
open 
question is not whether the (61:00) stamping line will be here. It's 
going to be here well in advance of the Model 3, but it's like the question is 
really how long does it take to work out the bugs in the stamping line? And 
how many iterations does this on
e have to go through to get it operating 
smoothly? But it'll all be here and it'll be a hive of activity, and I'll be 
personally down there looking at the line as I was with the Model S line and 
I'm confident that I don't think that's going to be an issue.
 
There's some long lead stamping tools, the stamping dyes, and there's a lot 
of them. And there's some sort of fairly obscure sounding dyes. Like, there's 
like one dye for the seat frame. It's currently a long lead item. But since we 
know about it, we're a
ttacking it, and that's unlikely to be a schedule driver. 
So, things that are likely to be schedule issues are things that we actually 
just don't know about today. And if we know about, we're attacking 
vigorously.

one from me on

terms of the 1 million vehicles, but I wonder if you could just speak to the

from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche

Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. Was hoping just to get a few more points to calibrate to 
expected free cash flow breakeven at the Motors company, and when you 

 
I guess there's a couple of things on this. One is you mentioned that the 
CapEx of $2 billion to $2.5 billion is until the Model 3 launch. Could you just 
give us an idea of what you're expecting for the full year? What the rate 
would be post launch of Mod
el 3?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, right now, I think we said earlier, I think we're just focusing on our first 
half guidance, rather than the second half of the year. There's going to be 
lots of exciting things going on in the second half of the ye
ar with solar roof 
and Model 3 getting to scale and everything else, so we're just focused on 
that at this point in time.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, I mean, there's obviously going to be a fair bit of incremental 
investment to go from 5,000 
cars a week to 10,000 cars a week, but it's 
going to be a lot less than getting to 5,000 cars a week in the first place. We 
don't know exactly what that's going to be except I'm confident it'll be less. 
Because the first thing we'll try to increase output 
is going back to rocket 
equation is to increase exit velocity of the line. And we don't know exactly 
where the trouble points (64:53) are going to be. We tried to model it out as 
carefully as possible, but there'll be things that aren't captured in the mod
el.
 
But I think in a lot of cases, we'll simply be able to run the lines faster as 
opposed to duplicate the line. That's by far the best CapEx maneuver is just 
to make it go faster. But I would say it's going from 5,000 to 10,000 is 
probably 

 
this is a to
tal wild
-
ass guess, so (65:35) right way to think about, 
but it's like somewhere between 50% to 70% of the cost of the 5,000 line. 
Something like that.
 
If you're lucky and smart, 50% is only half the game, which obviously is 
pretty awesome from a CapEx sta
ndpoint. I can't imagine it being more than 
about 70% as much as there is. So, JB, what do you think?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, I think that's right. And it's maybe helpful to realize, but a lot of the 
infrastructure investments to get all the
 
way to 10,000 are already 
completed, Gigafactory in particular.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
That's true.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, it's not even as if we're starting from scratch to go from 5,000 to 
10,000.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
That
's true. I mean, some things are worth, like, well, you can spend 10% 
more like in a really good case. You can spend 10% more and have twice as 
much capacity, and you're like, okay, sure. It's not great in the short
-
term, 
but it's obvious good thing in the
 
long
-
term.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(66:34) great efficiencies in the way to layout of facility, for instance, as 
there were at Gigafactory. So, we don't anticipate needing to build much 
new square footage, for instance, to go all the way to 10,0
00, even though 
we would be expanding the internal production lines while we speed them up 
and add new instances of production, but the Tesla CapEx would not be a 
one
-
to
-
one scaling, not even close.
 
Rod Lache

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Could you comm
ent on the run rate of OpEx for 2017, for the Motors 
company or for the whole company?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure, I think the way to think about it is we're going to continue to drive 
efficiencies in G&A. We have to do that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tes
la, Inc.
 
In part, because we can't send people in the (67:19).
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-

Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It seems like a silly concern, but like it's really quite difficult.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We have a real volumetric p
roblem. It's a good constraint to have.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, parking is like one of my biggest nightmares. Like, where do we park 
everyone? It's like you can't fit everyone. So we have to make our OpEx 
better because there's nowhere for people
 
to go.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, we're at that stage now where G&A will continue to scale sub
-
linearly 
with revenue, and we'll continue to always push productivity. Productivity, 
productivity, productivity. And then we'll obviously need to continue to make 
investments on the sales sid
e, and even in my new ventures, I'll be calling 
Jon and harassing him about his numbers.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes, we should point out like from a demand generation standpoint, like we 
don't need to make actually any investment for Model 3 probabl
y for the 
next 12 months. So, it's the delivery of the cars where the investment is 
needed. If you deliver three times or four times as many cars, well, we don't 
want to have three times or four times as many delivery centers, so how do 
we make that delive
ry process more streamlined, less paperwork, less 
bureaucracy, get people ahead of time, really well produced instruction 
videos for how to use their car, although of course the best instruction, the 
best thing is not having instructions. And you'll actual
ly be able to like play 
all of the instructions for your car on your car.
 
So, if you don't want to have any of it, you can just look at that. You can 
look at your email or (69:07) the car. But there's 

 
sales is actually demand 
generation and then delivery
 
of the car, if that's also part of sales. That's the 
scaling part. And then service. Our (69:25), like we increased the design 
lifetime of the powertrain from roughly 0.25 million miles to aspirationally 1 
million miles. So, that should really help with s
ervice.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
I guess, just still trying to calibrate to this cash flow and cash needs, maybe 
a different way to ask this, is it reasonable to expect that you would hit for 
the Motors company free cash flow breakeven at
 
the 250,000
-
unit a year 
level for Model 3, assuming what we know today?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It depends on how quickly we want to ramp production to go from 5,000 a 
week to 10,000 a week for Model 3. There could be an argument that you 
don't want
 
to go to cash flow breakeven or positive because you're losing a 
lot of sales and when you calculate the present value, huge (70:41) cash 
flows, then it's like actually not smart to be in that case free cash flow 
positive. Or maybe you want to be a little
 
negative at least and not give up a 
huge number of sales, because we would be talking 

 
the numbers get just 
so crazy, it's 0.25 million units a year, roughly $1 billion a month revenue.
 
And so then you double that and it's $2 billion a month. So, maybe s
pending 
an incremental $0.5 billion on CapEx would be pretty smart move if it 
advances things by two months or three months.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Yes, so it just seems like at that level of 250,000, you'd be generating 
probably at lea
st $2 billion of gross profit from Model 3, and if you continue 
this Model X rate, you're at $2.5 billion of gross from that, so even with 
OpEx of just under 3 (71:50) and CapEx of just under 3 (71:51), if you add 
in D&A, it looks like it's pretty close, b
ut I understand. It sounds like it's 
within your control.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Right. It's within our control. I mean, look, if we were to just level off, we 
could be cash flow positive right now.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Right, 
yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Obviously we're in the sort of low 20%s to mid
-
20%s on gross margin in the 
car at a $10 billion a year run rate. That's $2 billion to $2.5 billion. So, we 
could definitely be profitable and cash flow positive at that leve

our growth rate would be way slower.
 
So, it's kind of just really like a series of overlapping parallel MPV streams is

making a smart move, please 
tell us. Like, we'd love to hear a feedback. We're definitely not going to hit 
the bull's
-
eye every time. We're going to make mistakes. And hearing 
feedback from you would be great.

8/8/13,Tesla,"I think our letter says most of it, but I think we're going to spend extra time 
on Q&A and try to answer as many questions as possible. I think we should 
be able to answer, so we're going to go as long as there are good questions 
to answer. The thing 
I'm most excited about is the rapid increase in output. 
We got just in the last 24 hours at the Gigafactory managed to achieve a 
sustained rate of over 3,000 packs per day 

 
sorry, per week, and actually 
reached a peak hour with extrapolated outward would 
be a rate of about 
5,000 cars per week.
 
Obviously, you cannot take a peek hour and assume every hour is as good 
as peak, but if you can achieve it even once in an hour then with continued 
refinements of the system and improved operational uptime of the 
mac
hinery, it means that you can achieve that sustained rate with more 
refinement. So, you spend essentially a month or two improving the 
operational uptime and the system as a whole will be able to do well over 
5,000 I think.
 
I mean, what's interesting is th
at at least in the case of pack production we 
were able to do this with minimal CapEx. And I think, in general, our 
understanding of production is improving dramatically, exponentially in fact, 
and we are seeing ways to achieve improved volume with dramati
cally less 
CapEx by simplifying production line, by really engaging all of our associates 
no matter how junior in improving the way that parts are made. It's amazing 
how everybody's got good ideas, just needs to solicit those ideas and 
implement them, and 
then making ongoing design improvements so that 
when we discover that something is not well designed for manufacturing that 
we very quickly change that part design and introduce that into the flow.
 
One more thing that we've also found is that there are som
e things that are 
very well suited to manual operation and some things that are very well 
suited to automated operation, and the two should not be confused. So, I 
should be clear that the vast majority of the Tesla production system is 
automated. However, 
as I've mentioned in a tweet a few months ago, we did 
go too far on the automation front and automated some pretty silly things.
 
One example would be, we have this 

 
this is sort of ironically foolish 

 
we 
had these fiberglass mats on the top of the batter
y pack. They're basically 
fluff. So, we tried to automate the placement and bonding of fluff to the top 
of the battery pack, which is ridiculous. So, we had fluffer bot, which was 
really an incredibly difficult machine to make work. Machines are not good a
t 
picking up pieces of fluff. Human hands are way better at doing that. And so, 
we had a super complicated machine using a vision system to try to put a 
piece of fluff on the battery pack.
 
One of the questions I asked was, do we actually need that? So, we 
tested a 
car with and without and found out that there was no change in the noise 
volume in the cabin. So, we actually had a part that was unnecessary. That 
was forced 

 
line kept breaking down because fluffer bot would frequently 
just failed to pick up th
e fluff while put it in, like, a random location. So that 
was one of the silliest things I found.
 
And this still remains to be fixed in a lot of cases, but we're over
-
generalizing the design. So, for example, the car battery pack has a port for 
the front d
rive unit, which we then put a sealed blanking plate on. So 
essentially we punched a hole in it, then put a blanking plate over the hole 
and do that for all rear
-
drive unit cars, which is kind of crazy. We've added 
cost, we've added a manufacturing step, w
e've added a failure mode, and 
for something that is unnecessary. So, that is an example of something 
that's changed.
 
And the net result is we've had a radical improvement in production. Battery 
pack production went from taking seven hours to make a pack t
hree weeks 
ago to under 70 (07:29) minutes now. So it's just show that, like, really 
radical improvements are indeed possible.
 
We also saw enormous improvement in zone four of module production. 
This, I should point out, is a fully automated zone, and we'r
e able to also 
achieve sustained rates of 3,000 vehicles a week. So, we're actually slightly 
ahead in factory module and pack production than expected.
 
And with some work at the Fremont vehicle plant, primarily in the general 
assembly area, I'm confident w
e will very soon exceed the 3,000 mark in 
Fremont.
 
So, we're already there in the body shop, which is also almost entirely 
automated, where we weld up the body. They're already capable of over 
3,000 cars a week. And then the general assembly with some 
impr
ovements, which will include reduction some 

 
I should say, temporary 
reduction in automation in a few places then we should be able with (8:53) 
3,000.
 
So basically I'm feeling really good about the Tesla production of Model 3, 
and I'm very proud of the wo
rk the team has done. There's been an amazing 
amount of hard work and sacrifice by some very talented people to achieve 
this outcome.
 
It's worth noting the 

 
you see a chart in the Model 3 market share versus 
competitors and mid
-
sized premium sedans. We ar
e almost the best
-
selling 
sedan in the United States in this category as of April and we will certainly 
be there in May, unless something really odd 

 
I mean, be there in May and 
then we're really be there later this year.
 
In the third quarter 

 
I mean I t
hink there's a good chance Model 3 gets 
maybe close to majority market share of mid
-
sized premium sedans, 30% to 
40% seems likely, and maybe a majority market share later this year. This 
is coming from outstanding start against a lot of established brands 
who 
have far more sales outlets than we do. So, this is very encouraging.
 
Yeah, as the letter says, I'm feeling quite confident about achieving GAAP 
net income and positive cash flow in Q3. This is not a certainty, but it does 
appear quite likely in my vie
w. We are going to conduct a sort of 
reorganization, restructuring of the company this month, and make sure 
we're well set up to achieve that goal.
 
And in particular, the number of sort of third
-
party contracting companies 
that we're using has really gotte
n out of control, so we're going to scrub the 
barnacles on that front. It's pretty crazy. We've got barnacles on barnacles. 
So there's going to be a lot of barnacle removal.
 
All right. You guys want to make any comments?
 
Martin Viecha

Tesla, Inc.
 
Thank you, Elon. Sherry, let's go to the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes. Good afternoon. I want to talk a little bit a
bout, first of all, if we talk 
about the 

 
it's sort of all related to the production ramp 

 
if we talk about 
the 5,000 per week run rate, is that assuming 7/24? Or at what point do you 
think you get to sort of five
-
day two shift operation?
 
Elon Reeve Musk
 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, this is what I think a five
-
day two shift operation is a ridiculous way to 
operate, because that would be a very poor use of CapEx, nor is it the way 
that we have operated for most of Tesla.
 
So the module production, cell module and ba
ttery pack production and 
powertrain production have always operated on a 24/7 basis. And the 
exception has been general assembly, which is operated on typically two to 
three shifts, so a five to six day 20
-
hour shift, and paint which is operated 
on kind o
f a six
-
day basis. So, I think it makes sense to operate the whole 
company on the same basis, but a majority of Tesla production has operated 
on a 24/7 basis, since we started production.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, this is JB. I can 
chime in. As Elon said, it really makes great 
use of the CapEx in the lines and that's why we did it starting way back at 
the beginning of S. But aligning everything to the same shift schedule make 
it so much more efficient, because we don't have the seesa
w of inventory, 
inter
-
line inventory between the different shops, so.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Exactly. One of the key things to improving capital efficiency of the system is 
reducing work in process and if you don't have 

 
if the shifts are not align
ed 
then you have to build up inventory in kind of a storage warehouse.
 
And so, it's pretty foolish to actually operate on a five
-
day two
-
shift thing 
anyway. Yeah, but this is sort of a 

 
we're using the chip fab approach to 
capital efficiency, so it's been
 
called AWS, (14:49), it's called but like there's 
something called alternate work whatever.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Week.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Alternate workweek. Yeah, I think they're pretty cool, people work like three 
long days and t
hen four long days alternately, something like that.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Multiple crews rather than just using overtime on weekends.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, yeah, exactly.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Right. So, it seems lik
e just as a...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's not like one person working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There 
are like four or five shifts.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yeah. So, if I just do the math that would seem at 5,000 to get y
ou to takt 
time of two minutes. And I go back to some of the prior conversations, I 
mean, that's my understanding is best
-
in
-
class is sort of 50 seconds to a 
minute, and I thought the whole going faster than grandma walker was 
actually targeted at blowing 
past that. But it sounds like you're sort of 2X 
the takt time of other factories?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The number you're referring to is actually the general assembly number.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Vehicles per minute.
 
Elon Reev
e Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's general assembly number, not other stuff, but...
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You may have also not taken into account so
-
called OEE, or the actual 
uptime of the line, which tends to make the takt time a lit
tle faster than the 
(16:15).
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, like if Toyota say that (16:19) takes a minute then, I mean, it's like 

 
over a 7
-
day, 24
-
hour workweek. Like we could also just say, like sure, we 
did a peak pack production today was 32 pac
ks in an hour, so we're under 
two minutes a pack and rising from there.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, and the numbers go up rapidly as we go to the subassemblies that are 
in higher unit quantity per car.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So 4X per module and then we have smaller subassemblies still that are 
factors of 10 or 20, even higher than that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. And with that said, I do believe that the path to manufacturing 
efficie
ncy is velocity; velocity and density. And that is absolutely what we'd 
be working on rather than just trying to spend billions of dollars on 
duplicating a factory. Like, if two companies are competing and one has to 
double its CapEx in order to double pro
duction, and the other one can, with 
minor CapEx, can just speed up the line by double, it's a game over.

Right. But in the meantime, the lines 

 
again I get (17:33) what you're 
saying some starts, some stops to ge
t to the 5,000 per week?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, like you can't have like zero maintenance time and zero 

 
you have to 
do equipment upgrades. You have to do ongoing maintenance, so you can't 
just have it be operating at peak rates 24/7.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.
 
Rod Lache

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. Just wanted to follow along on that line of questions. So to 
the exten
t that you're adding humans in certain automated processes, can 
you just help us interpret the extent to which these changes affect the 
economics on Model 3?
 
And to the extent that you've done some competitive analysis, all of these 
efforts in the Tesla pr
oduction system, how do you stack up competitively 
against other OEMs in terms of labor hours per vehicle or depreciation per 
vehicle?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, I'll say a few things, then I have 

 
Deepak can elaborate. Let's see, so 
the thing th
at I've noticed is, if you have a really complicated machine like 
the fluff bot that I was talking about earlier, in order to keep it operating you 
have to have a ton of maintenance engineering. So, you have, like, basically 
pretty expensive maintenance en
gineers that have to maintain the thing and 
fix it, like, basically 7
-
days a week, 24 hours a day.
 
The cost of the maintenance engineer may not be fully incorporated directly 
into gross margin, but is nonetheless a cost that far exceeds the labor cost 
of s
imply placing the fluff on the battery pack, which as I said that was 
unnecessary.
 
So, I think that actually 

 
I do not see this having a mature, long
-
term 
impacting our costs. I actually see most likely our costs will decrease. Fully 
considered costs of p
roducing the vehicles will decrease by getting rid of 
production stations that are really poorly suited to robotics, because of the 
very expensive cost of robot technicians.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Rod, we are very CapEx
-
efficient, overall. Let me just 
start from that point. 
And if we look at our depreciation costs on a per unit basis at steady run 
rate of 5,000 or so cars per week, we are in my mind well below most of our 
competitors 

 
well below $2,000 per unit depreciation cost.
 
And then overall, clea
rly there is some impact, as we have indicated in the 
letter, from the additional labor we've added, but it's temporary. And our 
expectation fully is a lot of this labor will come out once we stabilize 
production and then figure out smart ways of automatin
g where it makes 
sense.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks for that. And just secondly, your comments in your letter on 
the advances in batteries were interesting. Could you give us some insight 
into how we can translate that into cost
 
per kilowatt hour? Or some metric in 
terms of the gains that you're making?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Every data point, Rod, that we look at internally suggests that we are best
-
in
-
class, but we don't prefer to...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We're 
best, which is not a class.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yes. We're the best. Sorry.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The best
-
in
-
class of one.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think directionally, Rod, it's helpful to understand the different commodities 
an
d the trends that we're pursuing in the batteries. Being on a path to 
reduce cobalt usage, for instance, has been something we've been working 
on for literally several years now, and this has been extremely helpful in the 
overall cost per kilowatt hour, es
pecially with recent commodity price 
movements. So, we can't really be quantitative, but that directionally is a 
pretty good trend.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, we think we can get the cobalt to almost nothing.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, 
Inc.
 
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks. Elon, so you repeatedly said I think in recent weeks that you do not 
need to issue equity capital at Tesla, and I think many investors on this call 
would say it's better to raise capital when you don't need to. So I guess the 
first question is...
 
E
lon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I disagree.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Yeah, you may not need to, but do you want to?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No. I specifically don't want to.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Perfect. Oka
y. My follow
-
up, Elon, is your cars produce currently a large 
amount of data, and SpaceX gets into the satellite broadband business next 
year somewhat...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, ad hoc, yeah (23:16)
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. 
LLC
 
Yeah. Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Not next year, but it's probably three years.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Three years.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thank you for tha
t. Some argue that SpaceX could offer Tesla a resilient 
cyber secure pipe for this precious vehicle data and a potential competitive 
advantage. So, Elon, isn't bandwidth an obvious domain for collaboration 
between Tesla and SpaceX one day?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I mean, it might be. There's lots of interesting things you could do. The cars 
got a lot of computing power, and it's connected to the cell networks and Wi
-
Fi and everything. And we could certainly connect it to LEO Internet 
constellation. I 
haven't thought about it, but probably you're right.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks.
 
Martin Viecha

Tesla, Inc.
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with 
Goldman 
Sachs.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Elon you talked about the downtime 
on the Model 3, you're going to take two planned periods this quarter, one 
has already occurred, the other is going to occur
 
later in the quarter. What 
specifically have you addressed in Fremont so far? And what are you 
planning to address a little bit later? And are those the alone kind of 
remaining bottlenecks for you to get to the 5K within the Fremont plant?
 
Elon Reeve Musk
 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, the Tesla production system at this point is fast, so and we literally 
have the two biggest factories on earth between the Gigafactory and 
Fremont. The Giga is still slightly smaller than Fremont, maybe just 

 
yeah, 
size
-
wise (25:08), 
but it'll soon be bigger than Fremont. And Fremont is like 
the second biggest building of any kind by footprint.
 
So, it is a vast 

 
the full answer to that question is a complex one. I feel 
very confident about our ability to get to 5K very soon sustained 
rate at 
Giga, essentially getting to 5,000 battery packs and motors and power, 
inverters and chargers and that kind of thing sold down (25:46) at Giga by 
the end of next month.
 
And body production, no problem, general assembly is probably our biggest 
risk,
 
and I'm refocusing on personally on that a lot in the next 

 
in the 
coming month.
 
And then our paint shop is maybe the second biggest risk after general 
assembly. These are all quite manageable. There's not like you need (26:27) 
brain surgery to get these
 
things right. There's lot of work. Like I said, it's 
just a lot of time and hard work, but it's very doable and, yeah, it's really 
quite straightforward, it's not like a fundamental impediment here.
 
Doug Field 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
In many cases, we've seen 
huge gains through software, software that's in 
the car, software that controls the automation and connects to our central 
system. So in many cases, it's not even hardware upgrades that create 
substantial increases in velocity.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc
.
 
Yeah, exactly. Doug makes a good point here. And I think that is 

 
the 
production, a really great production system is primarily a software problem. 
And there's no one in the auto industry that is remotely as good as Tesla 

 
as software as Tesla. Tesla i
s way better at software than any other car 
company. So if it is, what I'm saying is true, that the biggest challenge in a 
production system is software, and we are in a good position.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Maybe taking my next q
uestion in a different direction. What is your 
timeline for launching the Model Y and have you begun to spend for this? Or 
that only begin to start hitting the P&L from an R&D and a CapEx 
perspective in 2019?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It will only star
t to become significant in 2019.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Okay. So all of the CapEx spend for this year is associated with Fremont 
Model 3 Gigafactory?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
No, no, please don't take it literally. I said it will o
nly start to become 
significant next year. It's not zero right now, but it's not a big number. It's 
not a big number relative to our revenue.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
In the early days of product development anyway there's not much CapEx. 
CapEx becomes..
.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
(28:33) as you committed to equipment and equipment starts to become in
-
house.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah. Although, it is remarkable, like, although the amount of money spent 
in the 
beginning is really quite low, it begun with development (28:44) 
program, decisions made at beginning of the development program have 
massive implications for future CapEx. So it is better to spend a bit more 
time making the right design decisions and real
ly thinking through the 
producibility of product, before racing ahead with CapEx decisions.
 
There's no question we could have made the Model 3 much easier to 
produce than we have. Model Y, I think Model Y is going to be a 
manufacturing revolution. It will 
be, I think, incredible from a manufacturing 
standpoint, because we do not want to go through this pain again. Yeah.
 
Martin Viecha

Tesla, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah
 
with Nomura Instinet.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Instinet
 
Hi. Yeah, I just wanted to clarify the gross margin comments related to 
Model 3 that you put in the letter. You said a couple things. You said over 
the medium
-
term, Model 3 gross margins would be
 
below the target of 25%. 
You also said that in Q3 and Q4, that those gross margins would be highly 
positive. So, I'm just trying to understand what's possible for Model 3 gross 
margins by the end of the year? Could we get to a number that's close to 
20%?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
What I'd say is that progressively each quarter we will be getting better, and 
yes. The answer is yeah. And it'll come down to what other economics come 
into play from currencies to commodities and how much more costs we take 
out
 
from labor. So, I don't want to give you a specific number, but it'll be 
close to it.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly. It's very close to 20%, it could be slightly lower, it could be 
slightly above.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura 
Instinet
 
Okay. Fair enough. And then, Elon, can I just ask you about...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sorry, just going a little further forward than, say Q4. We're very confident 
of the 25% gross margin...
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Thanks for clarifying 
that. Yeah, we feel very good about that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
For next year, 25% is definitely what we would expect.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Instinet
 
So, when you say medium
-
term, you're talking 2018?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, 
exactly. That's why I was looking forward to clarify what these things 
mean. Q4 is when we expect to be on or about 20%. Then 

 
but by the 
middle of next year, 25% gross margin should be where we are. And then, 
we'll also try to get to the high
-
20s by the 
next year.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah 
-
 
Nomura Instinet
 
Okay. Okay. As a follow
-
up, could you just comment on Jim Keller's 
departure? A highly respected chip architect. What does it say, if anything, 
about the development of Tesla's custom silicon and autopilot? 
Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, Jim's a great guy, and there's sort of a career he wanted to pursue for 
a long time which is to kind of redesign how server architecture works. 
Something that I find a little bit (32:25) interesting, but it's 
something that 
Jim 

 
it's been a sort of personal dream that (32:27) Jim's to do and that's 
why he went to Intel.
 
The design of the Tesla hardware is primarily led by Pete Bannon, I should 
be clear (32:47). The lead designer of that is Pete Bannon, who is 
still with 
Tesla. And, of course, Andrej Karpathy is head of our AI team. So, we don't 
plan to hire a replacement for Jim's position.
 
Martin Viecha 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Great. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next questi
on comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to follow
-
up on the previous question and the 
gross margin targets. I think you had said last quarter that once you got to 
5,
000 units, you felt that you could get to 25% gross margins on Model 3. 
So, that feels like at least a six
-
month or nine
-
month delay relative to what 
you thought a quarter ago. And I'm trying to understand what the key 
drivers are. Is it really the labor f
or capital substitution? I don't think 
currency sequentially has changed much. I understand it can be a headwind, 
but I think relative to when you made those statements it hasn't changed. 
So, perhaps you can help us understand what has changed in terms of 
the 
gross margin ramp for Model 3 relative to what you thought before? And I 
have a follow
-
up, please.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's along the lines of what we said in the letter. If we look at the 
combination of the recently imposed tariffs, Secti
on 232 and countervailing 
duties, plus commodity price increases as well as the weaker dollar that is 
adding significant material costs. And then temporarily, we're using more 
labor. So when you combine those two, that's what led to our guidance. And 
certa
inly the labor cost piece we will address, and that will come out.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, but we're talking about a 3% to 5% difference, and that's something 
that we'll solve like within three to six
-
months later. So it's not like it's 
some 
(34:57) case out of it.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. And then separately, what if anything are you taking out in terms of 
your lowered CapEx projection for this year? And specifically, in spending 
less than $3 billion, 
where does that take you in terms of both battery and 
production capacity for the Model 3?
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So, we're just being much more smarter in many cases. As Elon said, we are 
not just spending money on automation. We're, of course, lookin
g at the 
problem, simplifying it, and that's helped us reduce our CapEx on Model 3.
 
And then, we're also being critical about how we grow our infrastructure and 
line it up with our growth in our business. So, we feel that these are the 
right decisions, and
 
there is still room for us to reduce it further, if we wish 
to. So, we are leaving ourselves some discretion here to go spend money 
where needed.
 
Antonio M. Sacconaghi 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
And so where specifically will you be in terms of capi
tal requirements?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Tesla, Inc.
 
Excuse me. Next. Boring bonehead questions are not cool. Next?

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thank you. The first
 
question is related to the Model 3 reservations, and I 
was just wondering if you gave us a gauge as maybe some of the impact 
that the news has had. Like, of the reservations that actually opened and 
made available to configure, can you let us know, like, 
what percentage 
have actually taken the step to configure?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

We're going to go to YouTube. Sorry. These questions are so dry. They're 
killing me.

Thank you. Our next question is from Galileo Russell with HyperChange.
 
Ga
lileo Russell

HyperChange LLC
 
Hey. Great quarter. Thanks for having me on the call to represent retail 
investors. I was wondering with Waymo's plans to launch an autonomous 
taxi service in limited markets this year, if you could give us an update on 
the 
Tesla Network? And any details surrounding the launch date or 
geographic rollout? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sure. Thank you for an interesting question. The way things are obviously 
rolling towards is a shared electrical autonomy model. So, in 
order for the 
whole sort of system to work, you need all the pieces in place. You need to 
have full autonomy, level four or five, whatever you want to call it and, 
obviously, a lot of cars on the road, and then build the software 
infrastructure behind that
 
to enable shared autonomy, to enable people to 
share their cars and be able to offer their cars as effectively kind of a robo
-
Lyft or robo
-
Uber, sort of like a combination of like, I guess, Uber, Lyft and 
Airbnb type of thing, where you can own your car a
nd have 100% usage of 
an autonomous electric car.
 
You can say it's available generally to anyone who wants to use it. When 
you're not using it, you can recall it, at will. You can restrict usage to only 
friends and family, or only users who are five
-
star. 
This is like the obvious 
thing that's going to happen.
 
In order for that to be in place, we have to obviously sell full autonomy and 
we're making really good progress on that front. I believe that the current 
production of 

 
vehicles that we are currently 
producing are capable of full 
autonomy with the only thing that would really be, like, might be needed 

 
maybe is probably needed is a computer upgrade to have more processing 
power for the vision neural net. But that's a plug
-
in replacement, a thing 
that 
can be done quite easily.
 
So, I think we're really well
-
positioned and are building the right 

 
the 
foundation for having millions, ultimately tens of millions of shared 
autonomous electric vehicles I think we're shooting like I said (40:08) decide 
not to 
share if you don't want to. (40:12)...
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
And specifically on the timing, though. Do you have any details about or 
when we could even expect to learn more about the timing of this service?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, the hardest thing to break about the timing is regulatory approval. The 
thing that's tricky with autonomous vehicles is that autonomy doesn't reduce 
the accident rate or fatality rate to zero. It improves it substantially, but the 
reality is that eve
n though we think our 

 
we think autonomy, even car 
autonomy reduces the probability of a death by 30%, which would be 
incredible because there's like 

 
broadly there's over a 1 million, I think 1.2 
million automotive deaths per year. And how many do you r
ead about? 
Basically, none of them. However but, if it's an autonomous situation, it's 
headline news, and the media fails to mention that 
-
actually they shouldn't 
really be writing the story, they should be writing the story about how 
autonomous cars are r
eally safe, but that's not the story that people want to 
click on.
 
So they write inflammatory headlines that are fundamentally misleading to 
the readers. It's really outrageous. And this will be true, even if electric cars 
were 

 
sorry, if autonomous cars 
were 10 times safer, so if instead of a 1 
million deaths you had 100,000 deaths. There is still going to be people who 
will still sue and say, hey, you're responsible for the death here. And it's like, 
well, the 90% of people who didn't die are not suing. 
They're still alive, they 
just don't know it.
 
So, we've got to deal with that and then obviously regulators respond to 
public pressure and the press. So, if the press is hounding the regulators, 
and the public is laboring on misapprehension that autonomy i
s less safe 
because of misleading press, then this is where I find the challenge of 
predicting it to be very difficult.
 
And, yeah, it's really incredibly irresponsible of any journalists with integrity 
to write an article that would lead people to believe 
that autonomy is less 
safe. Because people might actually turn it off, and then die. So anyway, I'm 
really upset by this.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
Yeah, really interesting answer. Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think Tesla is safe from
 
a technical standpoint. I think we'll probably be 
ready by the end of next year.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
Awesome. And then one more quick thing on production capacity and speed 
of the Fremont line, because this is something you mentioned a lot i
t seems. 
And in the last quarterly conference call, you mentioned the max capacity 
with 700,000 cars for Fremont or somewhere around there. And that was S, 
X, and 3. And so we recently got a report from Reuters saying that Model Y 
production would start in
 
November 2019 at Fremont. And so, I'm just kind 
of curious with the Semi and that Model Y launching next year, like, where 
you are actually planning on assembling these vehicles?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
The Reuters report is based on nothing. Like I
 
don't know where that came 
from. We will not be starting production on Model Y at the end of next year. 
I would say it's probably closer to 24 months from now. So 2020 is a more 
likely prospect for Model Y, early 2020.
 
And the production location for Mode
l Y has not been decided. We're really 
crowded here at Fremont. I don't know where we'd put the Model Y 
production, so it's difficult to imagine that. We just could not fit the Model Y 
production at Fremont. We are jammed to the gills here.
 
So one thing I 
know for sure, it's not here. It is crazy packed and we're 

 
yeah, so we'll try to figure out what the optimal location is for Model Y 
production, but it's not here. Not here at Fremont.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
Okay. And I'm not an expert in batt
ery pack technology, but it seems that a 
lot of people are speculating that the specs for the Semi truck, even I 
believe the CEO of Daimler said it breaks the laws of physics. So, I'm 
wondering is this just a linear...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
He does
n't know much about physics. I know him. I'd be happy to engage in 
a physics discussion with him. I actually studied physics in college.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
So, yeah, my question is that just a linear improvement in your battery 
technology? O
r is there some sort of new breakthrough or different platform 
that the Semi and Roadster are going to be built on?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Even if we didn't improve our battery technology at all, we could achieve a 
500 mile range truck at all. We're
 
going to do better than 500 miles.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, this is JB. I think the key point, it doesn't require some dramatic 
breakthrough. So, there's a fundamental misunderstanding I think of what 
the current technology in our existing 
products can actually do.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And maybe that's just the misunderstanding of sort of the current status of 
the technology versus others in the industry. That could be where some of 
that's com
ing from if they're benchmarking sort of the best battery pack 
they can buy from a supplier...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, exactly.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And then mapping that what the Semi could do, it doesn't give you 

 
it 
doesn't solve.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
You're right.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think that's maybe where some of it's coming from, but we basically have 
what we need in
-
house and understand how to do those specs today or 
better as Elon said.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

HyperChange LLC
 
Awesome. Great stuff. So, I'm also wondering, are you guys going to let 
Porsche best yo
u to market with a 350 kilowatt
-
hour Supercharger? Because 
I know you've mentioned V3...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We'll keep going if you (46:57) ask questions that are not boring. Sorry, go 
ahead.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
Yeah, I can 
keep going, so.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, that's cool. This is way more interesting.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
The 350 kilowatt charger from Porsche, like if they mentioned they're rolling 
that out, on the lab (47:11) call it. JB seemed t
o indicate that you guys were 
sort of going to keep the status quo with your Supercharger technology, but 
Elon, I know you've mentioned that there is a V3 Supercharger. So, I'm just 
trying to get some clarity on whether you will be improving your 
Superchar
ger technology or not, and if there is a V3?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Oh, we're definitely going to be improving our Supercharger technology. The 
thing about a 350 kilowatt charger is it doesn't actually make a ton of sense, 
unless you've got a monste
r battery pack or have like a crazy high C
-
rate, in 
which case your energy density is going to be poor. So it's kind of 
cockamamie. Yeah, we think maybe 200 kilowatt, on a per car 

 
also I don't 
know if they made (47:55) 350 kilowatts for a single car, tha
t's really pretty 

 
you're going to frag the battery pack if you do that.
 
You cannot charge a high
-
energy battery pack at that rate, unless it's a very 
high kilowatt
-
hour battery pack. So something along the 

 
yeah, I think 

 
I 
don't know, JB, a couple hun
dred, 200 kilowatt, 250 kilowatt maybe.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, that's definitely sort of the power level that we've discussed 
and explored and some of it also comes down to an optimization around 
utility versus cost and trade
-
offs 
in the car itself. You kind of hinted that 
Elon, but there is a trade
-
off fundamentally between charged speed and 
essentially range or cost of battery.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
And we look at that pretty 
carefully. We understand the trade
-
off and we 
could design cells and a pack that could charge at faster than 300, 400 
kilowatts. But it's not a very useful trade
-
off to the customer.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, (49:03) energy and power even really?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Energy 

 
(49:08) range and then power is kind of like your peak 
acceleration basically, the rate at which you consumer energy. So really, it's 
more important to have 

 
it's more importa
nt to have long range than it is 
to have a superfast charge time.
 
And you can sort of think about this in the devices that you use. Would you 
rather have a cell phone that lasted two hours, but it could charge in five 
minutes or 10 minutes let's say, but i
t only lasted two hours. Or you like a 
cell phone that lasts two days and maybe takes an hour to charge.

Thank you. Our next...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We'll keep going to (50:02) while they're interesting.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
Yeah, I have a couple more. For the Superchargers. I know you guys are not 
trying to profit off of Tesla owners with that infrastructure, but would you 
ever open that up to other automakers and try and generate revenue from 
that system?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
T
esla, Inc.
 
We always said that this is not intended to be a walled garden, and we're 
happy to support other automakers and let them use our Supercharger 
stations. They would just need to pay share of the costs proportionately to 
their vehicle usage. And th
ey would need to be able to accept our charge 
rate and our connector, or at least have an adapter to our connector.
 
So this is something we're very open to, but so far none of the other 
carmakers have wanted to do this. But it's like not because of opposit
ion 
from us. This is not a walled garden trying to make a moat (50:55).
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
Okay. And maybe could you clarify what's the strategy? It seems like that 
would be a very strong moat (51:03) network you guys have been building 
glob
ally for years. So why open it up, and why is that not a moat?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sorry, can you repeat the question?
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
I'm just wondering why that isn't a moat, because as a long
-
term investor, I 
feel like the ch
arging infrastructure you guys have built would take years 
and millions of dollars for another brand to replicate, so I'm just curious 
about the strategic thinking behind opening that up versus keeping it closed.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
First of all,
 
I think moats are lame. It's nice sort of quaint in a vestigial way. 
If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. 
What matters is the pace of innovation. That is the fundamental determinant 
of competitiveness.
 
And for an
y given company, if the rate of innovation, let's say, our 
competitors, maybe they come up with something every six years, we're 
maybe every two to three years. So, if our innovation is, let's say, twice that 
of any given competitor, then it is simply 

 
th
is is true of generally of 
companies in any industry. Whichever company has the highest rate of 
innovation, unless that company is actively killed by its competitors in some 
way that's nefarious, or shoots itself in the foot, it will at some point exceed 
t
hose competitors. Like, this is obvious that this would occur with Amazon 
and Walmart, because Walmart's rate of innovation was negligible, and 
Amazon's was very high. The outcome was obvious a long time ago.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
And in terms 
of the mega charger, I noticed you guys are going to be selling 
energy at a fixed price for those truck customers. So, I'm wondering what 
the velocity is there? Is it also you're going to operate that at cost and 
reduce that energy price? Or are you thinki
ng of that as a revenue stream 
for the company?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We haven't really talked about any of that, and haven't finalized frankly any 
of that. We want to make sure that there is a very seamless and easy 
system to operate 
trucks wherever they need to go. And some customers 
may elect to work with us on the whole system, or parts of it. But I think 
there's a lot of different ways that that can be solved.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, for sure with commercial truck, heav
y duty Semi, economics are 
fundamental to that situation. They're not making decisions based on 
aesthetics or consumer
-
related things. We tried to make our Semi kind of 
cool and sexy, just because we think that that's a good thing to do, not 
because it aff
ects the buying decision of our customers in a meaningful way. 
It doesn't really move the needle.
 
We have a slight laughable lawsuit recently from some company ironically 
called Nikola. Nikola is suing Tesla. That's hilarious. Fate loves irony. But 
they're
 
suing us because the way the trucks look, which is absurd. Nobody's 
buying a Semi truck because the way it looks, or because going to 
wraparound windshield or whatever. Please.
 
So the economics are incredibly important, and so we have to make sure 
that th
e Superchargers or mega
-
chargers, or whatever we call them, or the 
trucks are set up in a way to have very low cost electricity.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
One maybe slightly related point to that that I think is super exciting about 
this is the pot
ential to link up renewable energy generation at a very fixed 
and also very affordable cost to color future trucking fleets.
 
Ultimately, that can give customers an incredibly deterministic cost per mile 
that will not change with the price of petroleum over
 
decades, which is 
really, really an interesting proposition for a trucking customer. And that 
something that we're pretty excited about.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
I have one last one.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, In
c.
 
It's really what is emphasizing that. For trucking companies, like, if the cost 
of diesel goes up a few cents, it just like destroys their business, and with 
the sort of mega
-
charger situation, having (55:48) a solar battery powered 
mega
-
charger, we hav
e constant costs. And we know what they are. We 
bake them in.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
It's predictable.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's very predictable and lower cost per mile than a diesel truck. 
Primarily it's like, what is the cost? 
What's the cost per mile or kilometer of 
cargo? And that drives the commercial trucking market. And we could have 
the ugliest truck in the world and it still would be victorious.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
Yeah, and building on that, do you have any
 
thoughts on how the trucking 
market could change or potentially grow if you guys are actually able to 
deliver on dramatic cost reductions, especially with things like platooning?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think it will take away quite a bit of reven
ue from railway, because the 
reason rail is able to be competitive is it effectively just platooning with lots 
of railcars, and you need only a small crew to operate the train. However, 
trains don't go everywhere.
 
So you have to have a truck deliver things
 
to the train rail spur, and then at 
the destination the truck has got pick it up from the rail spur over there. So, 
you still have trucks plus train plus transfer. So, I think platooning of trucks 
will quite dramatically affect the rail industry in a nega
tive way.
 
Galileo Russell 
-
 
HyperChange LLC
 
Okay. Last one. I promise. On Tesla Energy, I assume that you guys are 
basically supply constrained, not demand constrained, on that side of the 
business. So, I'm wondering how you're prioritizing residential ver
sus utility 
scale. And in particular, how is this successful project in South Australia sort 
of changed the industry's perception of what batteries can do?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, I think it's had quite a profound effect. South Australia took a
 
chance 
on doing the world's biggest factory, and it's worked out really well. If you 
read the articles, it's worked out far beyond their expectations, because the 
battery is able to respond at the millisecond level, far faster than any 
hydrocarbon plant. 
And so, its battery (58:16) and grid stabilization was 
much greater actually than even a gas turbine plant, which normally respond 
quite fast.
 
So, it's kind of like you get on Tesla and you can have that instant 
acceleration. It feels like you have 

 
sort of like a mind meld with the car. So 
it's like the car is you. And that same rapid response is true of the battery 
pack. So the utilities that 
we've worked thus far have really loved the 
battery pack, and I feel confident that we'll be able to announce a deal at 
the gigawatt
-
hour scale within a matter of months. So, it's 1,000
-
megawatt
-
hours per (59:06).
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, ma
ybe just the first part of your question also, it is absolutely 
accurate that we are still 

 
there's more than enough demand and we are 
still building under our demand backlog and actually increasing it slightly. 
And we're trying to do our best to prioriti
ze customers between residential 
Powerwall and utility and commercial.
 
I'd say our longer
-
term strategy is to shift a little bit of our focus and really 
catch up on our Powerwall demand backlog, which is quite 

 
it's too long 
right now. We know people are 
waiting too long, so I think that's generally 
the direction we're trying to take that. But Model 3 has taken a lot of focus 
in the last few quarters and that trend is going to be reversing in the second 
half of the year.

Thank you. Our
 
next question comes from Phil LeBeau with CNBC.
 
Phil LeBeau

CNBC LLC
 
Hi, Elon. A question on the Tesla Semi. Can you give us some perspective in 
terms of how many reservations you guys have now? And where you guys 
are in the plan for developing it and r
olling out the first model?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
My apologies. Sorry, we were just discussing something internally. Could 
you repeat that question?
 
Phil LeBeau 
-
 
CNBC LLC
 
With the Tesla Semi, how many reservations do you guys now have 
approximatel
y? And where are you in the process as far as the development 
and the rollout of the first model in terms of timeline, when you guys expect 
that to happen, et cetera?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I actually don't know how many reservations we have for 
the Semi. About 
2,000? Okay. I mean, we haven't really tried to sell the Semi. It's not like 
there's like an ongoing sales effort, so sales 

 
orders for Semi are like 
opportunistic, really companies approaching us. Yeah, it's not something we 
really think 
about much. Our focus is on the Model 3. We need to get that to 
above 5,000 a week at a good margin. We need to become a profitable 
company. That is a good criticism that has been leveled to Tesla, inaccurate 
one, it is high time we became profitable. And 
the truth is, like you're not a 
real company until you are, frankly.
 
So that's our focus right now. And we've got an awesome product roadmap. 
The Tesla Semi is one of those things. And I think we've got a really good 
idea for 

 
the Model Y is going to be a
mazing. I'm really excited about that. 
Tesla Pickup's going to be great, and 

 
yeah, so. The product roadmap 

 
I 
mean, we have like way more cool things than we know what to do. Like, 
the idea is (01:02:29) Generation Park is devoted to execute it, so we j
ust 
need to stay focused and not divide our attention on too many products at 
one time.
 
Phil LeBeau 
-
 
CNBC LLC
 
And a follow up. Given the fact that you're already packed to the gills in 
Fremont, when will you make a decision regarding a second manufacturin
g 
facility?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So that's probably later this year. It has to be later this year. So I'm not 
sure of the exact time but I don't know, maybe next quarter, but not later 
than fourth quarter for Model Y. And then we also expect to an
nounce the 
location of the Tesla Gigafactory in China soon.
 
Phil LeBeau 
-
 
CNBC LLC
 
And will that second factory, when you announce it, will it be in North 
America? Or is that going to be in China?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, I just said it's in 
China.
 
Phil LeBeau 
-
 
CNBC LLC
 
So the Gigafactory is there, but the second manufacturing plant will be in 
China as well?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Sorry. Oh, I mean, yeah, so, in the future, all Gigafactories will include 
vehicle production. So, right, 
now we've got vehicle production and battery 
production. Like, battery production and motor and power electronics and 
charger production are at Giga and (01:03:52) Fremont car factory. But 
future Gigafactories will all incorporate vehicle production.
 
Phil 
LeBeau 
-
 
CNBC LLC
 
Got it. Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We're very appreciative of the fact that the Government of China has 
announced that they will be allowing full ownership of manufacturing 
facilities in China. I would just like to express a
n order of appreciation to the 
Chinese Government in that regard.
 
Robin, is there anything that you'd like to say or anything?
 
Robin Ren

We are in good discussion with the government, so we'll announce 
something (01:04:34).

Okay. So Robin Ren is here with me. Robin is managing worldwide sales for 
Tesla right now. He was born and raised in Shanghai. (01:04:54) But we'll 
talk more about 

 
I think in the next earnings call or next 

 
we'll have a lot 
more to say about
 
that in the future.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge.
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
And if I can be brief, I wanted to ask, given the coverage that you've 
received as it relates to these high profi
le accidents, one of the things we 
like most about your company is you have the most miles tested and 
continue to test daily from an autopilot perspective. Can you give us any 
color from what you're seeing in your data as it relates to the confidence 
that 
your consumers have in the autopilot functionality, whether they've 
used it more or less frequently in their existing vehicles? Or whether they've 
opted to purchase the functionality more or less in lieu of these accidents? 
Because we're really trying to g
et a sense of the likelihood of consumers to 
adopt this technology over time, so this would be very helpful. Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We do see a steady increase in the number of 

 
the percentage of miles 
driven using autopilot. As we roll out
 
more functionality, as we make it 
better, we see a steady increase. I think it's something 

 
(01:06:25) 
autopilot's something on the order of one
-
third of highway miles, maybe 
closer 

 
maybe a half in some cases, in some regions, are on autopilot.
 
But the
n, of course, when there's, like, negative news in the press then that 
dips. And then I was like, okay, this is not good because people are reading 
things in the press that causes them to use autopilot less. And then that 
makes it dangerous for our custome
rs, and that's not cool. That's why I'm 
against that.
 
And then we get accused of blaming the victim. I was like, what? We're not 
blaming the victim here, but it is important that people not be under the 
wrong impression. The statistics are unequivocal that
 
autopilot improves 
safety. No question.
 
In fact, one thing I was going to mention (01:07:16) is that we will be 
publishing our safety statistics on a quarterly basis...
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Wonderful.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, In
c.
 
...so people know exactly what autopilot safety is. Is it getting better? Or is 
it getting worse?
 
And one of the common misimpressions is that when there is, say, a serious 
accident on autopilot, people for some reason think that 

 
or some of the 
articl
es think that it's because the driver thought the car was fully 
autonomous and it wasn't, and we somehow misled them into thinking it 
was fully autonomous. It is the opposite case.
 
When there is a serious accident, almost always 

 
in fact, maybe 
always, the 
case that it is an experienced user and the issue is more one of 
complacency. Like, they get too used to it. That tends to be more of an 
issue. It is not a lack of understanding of what autopilot can do. It's actually 
thinking they know more ab
out autopilot than they do, like quite a 
significant understanding of it, but (01:08:36).
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Just to clarify, Elon, so you've got two accidents spaced out pretty far. 
You've had dips during those periods when th
e accidents occurred. But to 
clarify your comments, you are seeing increasing usage, and you've 
weathered those dips based on where we are today?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

That is correct.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Hey, Elon. So I remember the Baron story, I don't know if it was fake news 
or
 
not, what you hung up on about your battery costs. And I don't want to 
ask a mundane question, but I think it's important because one of your 
stakeholders are shareholders right now, and so far we've had a couple of 
push
-
outs in production. Is there a way
 
that you can update us when you 
get to that 3,000 number or 4,000 number per week? I mean you're active 
on Twitter. Can you just let us know because we are going to have a big 
vacuum here (01:09:35), and there's a lot of news flow out there that 
makes vol
atility into the slot, it makes it hard for people to own, even 
though you have a lot of believers out there.
 
And so even though we're being myopic right now, I think it's very important 
to get those kind of updates. And so I think that's my question. Can 
you give 
us an update when you get to 3,000 and 4,000 per week on the Model 3?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, actually, Tesla is such a leaky sieve of information that, I think, the 
news will leak pretty quickly. And also people track registrations ve
ry 
closely. So, at most, any information that we provide would be a week or 
two in advance of what will become public knowledge just due to vehicle 
registrations and shipments that are tracked very carefully. So really the 
point is, like, people get too fo
cused on, like, what's happening in the space 
of a few weeks or a few months. This is an old maxim of (01:10:40) 
investing, you should not be focused on short
-
term things, you should be 
focused on long
-
term things. We have no interest in satisfying the des
ires of 
day traders. I couldn't care less. Please sell our stock and don't buy it.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
I completely understand your frustration and I'm frustrated too on how 
myopic we are right now. They also say that great 
years were made out of 
quarters, and great decades are made out of years, so everyone's short
-
term focus in some ways, and volatility has a way of shaking people out 
even they are strong and want to be there.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
That's okay.
 
Benj
amin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
And anything you can do to help in the near
-
term on that, I think is helpful 
for the stock. (01:11:29) That's it.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think that if people are concerned about volatility, they shou
ld definitely 
not buy our stock. I'm not here to convince you to buy our stock. Do not buy 
it if volatility is scary. There you go.
 
Martin Viecha

Okay. And let's go to our last question now.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our last question comes from Al
ex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. Not sure if this is going to be a hard question to 
answer. You mentioned Model 3 market share versus the three series and 
others in that segment. To 
what extent do you think Model 3 is, I guess, 
changing the denominator, making that segment larger as a class versus 
what it used to be?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
I think it will probably increase the total number of sedans purchased. Yeah, 
I think so.
 
Alexander Eugene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
So you think you're pulling ex Accord buyers and Camry buyers into that 
class as example?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, we know this because of the trade
-
ins. So we see quite a wide range 
of cars. (01:12
:49) a lot of trading in the cars, they're not necessarily 
owners of a C
-
Class or an Audi A4 or the 3 Series.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
We saw signs of it even with Model S.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Even with Model S.
 
Deepak Ahuja 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
So th
at Model 3 is going to be even more prominent.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I think 

 
like, also once we get to, like, the shared 
autonomy ride hailing thing, which could be as soon as at the end of next 
year, but that's when it's
 
technically ready, but they're not long enough 
(01:13:26) that I would expect some jurisdictions to give regulatory 
approval. The effective cost of ownership of a Model 3 or Tesla drops 
dramatically because you can share that car with others.
 
Alexander Eu
gene Potter 
-
 
Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Okay. Very interesting. Last one. You mentioned earlier you think the Model 
Y production is going to be a true sort of production revolution. If you had to 
do the Model 3 over again there are some things that you would've 
changed, 
and you hope to incorporate those learnings into the Model Y. What 
specifically would you do? Or what specifically would you plan to do?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla, Inc.
 
Well, I think 

 
let's save that for another time. Like, we'll talk about 
that 
when we unveiled the Model Y. But it's really going to be dramatically better. 
The design and production system, I think, really will be next level.

Our first question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is 
opened.
 
Brian A. Johnson 

 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes, good afternoon. I know Elon you're back from China. Just want to get a 
sense of what the order book in China is 
looking for? How much of a 
contribution that's going to make to your especially second
-
half implied 
delivery targets? And then do you have to get beyond Beijing or Shanghai 
this year in order to grow in China 

 
grow further in China?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well I re

fact I was blown away by my visit to China at the level of interest and 
enthusiasm for Tesla and the amount of goodwill that I encountered from 
people at all levels, from the government, 
from people in industry and sort 

there.
 
We are trying to expand our service centers and Superchargers coverage as 
fast as possible in China, its not generate sales, its in order to b
e able to 
deal with the cost that we deliver in market. So we are really doing very few 
stores in China. Our focus is 90% plus on service centers and 

cost we send to China; otherwis
e it would starve the rest of the world 
production.
 

elected to do local vehicle production in China in three or four years, 
although I should mention the good will existed before I s
aid that, goodwill 
wasn't a function of that, but that will be for vehicles delivered to the local 
market in China and perhaps to some surrounding countries.
 

California that would b
e something that California is going to reach its max 
production and makes sense for us to start looking at local country factories. 
And I think we would be looking at one in Europe as well just to 

 
I mean 
these really end up minimizing our logistics cost
 
because shipping two tons 
of metal over long distances is not very efficient. So it's just a sensible thing 
to do is to try to satisfy local demand with local production over time.
 
Brian A. Johnson 

 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
In any sense of quantification t
he orders or the. Deposits or the wait times in 
China?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

mean it's really quite a long wait time. In fact, the only source of 
unhappiness that I encountered in China was 
that some customers who are 
in some of the mid
-
sized cities are unhappy that we're delaying their 
deliveries, because it will take us a bit longer to get the service and 
Supercharger access, but service is a necessary requirement, you cannot 
have a service
 
center be like by 500 miles away from subway sub
-
dealers. 


 
our biggest issue in China is like customer unhappiness 
they're not getting their cars soon enough. I think the wait time is quite long 
in some cases, like four months or five m
onths or something like that.

Our next question comes from Andrew James with Dougherty & Co., your 
line is open.
 
Andrea Susan James 

 
Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for
 
taking my questions. Your R&D expense is ramping pretty 
significantly sequentially in Q2, and I was wondering if you could talk about 
what components make up the R&D increase. Also, in line with that, how are 
the costs to bring the Model X to market kind 
of tracking against your earlier 
expectations?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
Yes hi James. Our R&D expenses went up exactly as planned in Q1. And it's 
primarily driven by all the engineering design and testing work that's going 
on, on our new product development. It
's the Model X, as well as what we're 
doing to get the Model S ready for China and other markets.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yeah, for examples there is like right hand drive.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
Exactly.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Japan localization or China 
localization, U.K.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
Right.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I think Hong Honk that kind of thing.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 

increases and so these are the technical expenses that you typically s
ee 
before the launch of new products.
 
Elon R. Musk
 


small improvements to the car and like all of these people wou

necessarily notice, but I think collectively they add up to an improved 

comfort for example and here and there in fit and finish, we're modifying the 
rear door. So it can open wider 
so rear ingress
-
egress is improved. There is 
a whole bunch of things
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 

 
Elon R. Musk
 
Software (indiscernible) I think there are some very exciting software 
updates that are going to come out in the n
ext few months that certainly will 
improve the experience of the whole suite of customers out there and if 

information as it is, but I think customers can certainly look forward to 
some 
really awesome functionality improvements in their exiting car.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
We are doing lot more country testing before launching in new markets to 

doing it in other co
untries too.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, exactly. I was mentioning it earlier, but I think there was a bit of 
unhappiness in China about some of the mid
-
size cities, delay in customers 
deliveries, but where we found is that its more important that we can service 
the
 
cars really well, that charging is sorted out and to make sure that when 
customer do get their car, they have an excellent experience. And I think 

 
we didn't do as good of job as we should have done in some of our prime 
market launches and want to make s
ure we recognize that mistake and 
correct it going forward.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
And I want to make sure mentioned Model X cars are also obviously driving 
the increased R&D expenses as we are looking Model X.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Model X is like the biggest driver 
for R&D expense honestly. You know, with 
the X we're really trying to make an amazing car and very importantly to 
have a car that where the production version is better than the prototype, 
better than the show car. The one thing that drives me crazy about 
the car 
industry is like you will see up in these great show cars. And then when you 
actually get the production car it's some bizarre dumbed
-
down facsimile of 
the exciting prototype that was displayed, that's terrible.
 
So the base line expectation of Tesl
a is that whenever we have a prototype, 
the production car is better in everyway, so that's quite difficult to do, and 
requires some creative problem solving with Model X the biggest challenges 
is the buckling door making sure that there is truly a step ch
ange in utility 

have to be just right, and it's amazing how 

 
its like sitting at little things 
become quite significant engineering challenges.
 
Such as for example getting the se
als on the buckling door to work properly 
and not be too prominent so that you got seal against rain, winds and 
against road noise, but you've got something that's articulating across 
multiple hinges. You've got key junction joints and that kind of thing. 
So it's 
quite a difficult ceiling problem to really get it right and be consistent and 
remain good over many years. So we spend a lot of time on seal 
engineering.

Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Thank you for the thorough response. One more and th
en I'm done. Why 
haven't your Gigafactory partner or partners, why haven't they signed on 
the dotted line yet?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

have a letter of intent signed with Panasonic. So we're ha
ppy to announce 
that 

 
yes, we have a letter of intent signed. I mean, for us that's actually 
not that big of a deal, because our expectation has always been that 

Panasonic's intent
. And in fact just make sure we're both on the same page. 
J.B. spoke with Panasonic yesterday just to make sure we're on exactly the 
same page. So J. B. do you want to us to elaborate on that?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
Sure, well as Elon said we do have a 
signed letter of intent, and under that 
letter of intent, we've also created a joint working team between Panasonic 
and Tesla that's working, almost daily, certainly weekly exploring all the 

actually 
quite comfortable that we're heading toward final agreements in the later 
part of this year. and it's something where as we said, it doesn't seem like a 

months and we fe
el confident in it.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes and I think we are quite confident, highly confident at this point of 
achieving the 30% reduction in costs per kilowatt hour. Maybe moving 
towards 

 
I would say course of the optimistic about exceeding that number. 
I do
n't want to make commitments, but I think we've got a decent chance of 
exceeding that number. As we explore the cost structure on the supply chain 
with Panasonic and with a number of other companies that make the pre
-
cost materials.
 
We've found that there'
s really a lot of opportunity for innovation and for 
cost reduction, and in fact, we've had a number of conversations that are 
really interesting with mining companies talking about some of the key 
constituents that go into the sale, such as the nickel and
 
cobalt, the lithium, 
although lithium is sometimes thought of as a bigger thing than it really is 
for lithium ion cell.
 

constituent is nickel and so we are in conversations with
 
some of the bug 

positively surprised, by the potential for cost reduction on producing the pre
-


 
in talking to like the 
mining c
ompanies is like nobody ever calls them. We call them up and like 
hey we never get calls from companies like Tesla, its in other words like 
telling to them on the metal exchange or the big stainless steel companies, 
because nickel is a common alloy and con
stituent of steel and like cutlery for 
example, using involves quite a bit of nickel so your knife and fork is usually 
electroplated nickel silver its usually what they do.
 
So the mining guys were just like super happy to hear from us and have 
quite good i
deas for how to optimize the cost of the materials or minimizing 
logistics and processing and just doing a fairly sensible things, a lot of its 
actually quite obvious to create a supply chain that can deliver a large 
volume of factory products with increme
ntally reduced cost and actually we 
are also trying to do our best to ensure that in the supply of the components 
or the sell that our suppliers are going to the mine level are companies that 
operate in a good and fair way and its like do they take reasona
ble care from 
an environmental standpoint, do they take care if people work in the mind 
that of kind of thing. As much as we can we want to make sure that our

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
open.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
First is a follow
-
up on the Gigafactory, is the formal announcements are kind 
of more than a lette
r of intent a pre request for breaking ground on the 
factory?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
No we actually expect to break ground on the first Gigafactory location, I 

we are talking to sort of hav
e the wrong impression. We are going to move 
forward with breaking grounds on multiple sites in order to minimize the risk 
of completion of the Gigafactory and we expect to break ground on the first 
of those probably next month. So I think quite soon and t
hen shortly 

second one.
 


 
I 
mean its still in these sort of improbable, but it is back in running and the 
gove
rnor and his staff have really, I think, tried to do everything they can to 
make California a significant candidate for the Gigafactory. The main thing 
with California is its 

 
do it in centers or anything like that is the time to 
completion of the Gigafac
tory.
 


construction project; California has quite a complex and lengthy process for 
approval of G

year or more for kind of to proceed, which would I think also make sure no 
environmental impact of any significance, but it would just take a long time 
for the California Regulatory Agencies t
o process information that they would 
need to for their obligations on the California Law. Whereas in other states 
it's much more streamlined approach.
 
The vehicles we build in Fremont in California, if we don't have the 
Gigafactory online when we have the
 
vehicle capacity online, we will actually 
be in deep trouble, because we'll have all the equipment and tooling and 
people for making cars, but not be able to produce the battery packs. So 
that was the reason why California wasn't on the list. The Governor
 
and 
Legislature are going to try to do something about that, but I think the 
question of timing is still a big one, and then we also need to make sure that 
the ongoing operational costs of the Gigafactory or not significant worse 
than other states. So I t
hink like I said, I think California's still in the sort of 
improbable, but not of being impossible category at this point.
 
Adam Jonas 

 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay, thanks Elon. Let me just add a follow
-
up. When you're thinking about 
the Gigafactory, is
 
the idea to have just one dedicated full
-
cell supplier like a 
Panasonic, or is it possible that it could be Panasonic and some co
-
opetition 
with another battery component or cell supplier making another part of the 
sub
-
cell, the cathode, or anode. Is ther
e mutual or pure exclusivity for a 
Panasonic, for example? Finally, on China, do you have 

 
or the expansion of 
other manufacturing in China or Europe, is that within the scope of your 
current capitalization and financial resources, or is that something 

 
or that 
of your expectation of your cash
-
flow generation, or is that another item on 
the list that might require new capital at some point? Thank you.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, so the way the Giga factory is set up right now is we 

 
Panasonic would 
be the only com
pany producing cells in the Giga factory. I mean one other 
thing in Giga factory is like sort of like an industrial park under one roof. 


 
Tesla is sort of the overall I guess landlord. 
We're producing the modules and the batt
ery pack. Then the cells are 
produced by Panasonic and then we would actually have a number of other 
companies producing the anode catheter, separators, electrolytes and so 
forth that have been feeding into Panasonic.
 
However, referring back to our origina
l short presentation on the Giga 
factory, you'll see that cell capacity target is around 35 gigawatt
-
hours, but 
the pack capacity is 50 gigawatt
-
hours. So we expect to bringing cells from 
other cell factories in the world to make up for others who are roug
hly 15 
gigawatt
-
hours, and those would be 

 
I would expect a lot of those would be 
Panasonic cells, but to a degree that Panasonic isn't able to meet that 
demand, there would be other suppliers as well.

Good evening. Just a couple ones here. Just in terms of the cadence of some

-
in
-
class vehicle producers 
probably have that in the mid
-
single digits as a percentage of sales, but just 
given your growth profile would probably be higher. Can you help us to 
dimension that as we think ab
out our forward modeling?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, in future quarters as we go towards the end of the year and potentially 
next year early as Model X development is behind us, I would expect some 
reduction in R&D spending, and then of course Gen III will pick up and other 
products that we start workin
g, but broader point of percentage of revenue, 
we clearly see that as revenue is going to pick up significantly, the 
percentage of revenue of R&D expenses it is going to be I expect in the 
single
-
digits 

 
high
-
single
-

 
be too far 
away in that sense from some of the other, I would say more growth 

we will be doing more R&D in general.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Absolutely.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs &
 
Co.
 
Okay, great.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
In fact I think R&D is maybe more limited by the phase, which we can create 
(indiscernible) integrated to the companies rather than sometimes budget, 
yes.
 
Patrick K. Archambault 

 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 

t as we think about the cadence of deliveries, which 
is obviously very back
-


sort of the back
-
half inflection? Is it cell capac
ity, is it that second, excuse 
me that second production line coming on? Is it just 

 

supply
-
driven than demand
-
driven, but just wanted to get a little more 

 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes. Th

actually I mentioned I think late last year is that the 

 
for the first of this 

process of alleviating and 
we expect that to really start alleviating in the 


over here and that kind of thing. Thus far from wha
t we see that you have 
things on track to have cells not 

 
be able to at least meet, but probably 
exceed by little bit the 35,000 in targeted deliveries. Our production number 

nickel
 
that will be only to best countries.
 
And then, the benefit other constrainers, which is the vehicle production line. 
So, it actually will actually be taking the factory 

 
the Fremont factory down 
for roughly days or so in July to convert inline, which ena
bles a substantial 
increase in our production capacity on the vehicle side, as well as a labor 


confusion between Tesla production and Tesla demand. For example, like 



ally able to get to customers. If we 
had been better at production and delivery would have little bit more cost.

Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Northland Capital Markets. 
Your line is open.
 
Colin W. Rusch 

 
Northland Capital Markets
 
With the Model X, previously you talked about going into production before 
the end of 2014. 

prototypes being done by the end of the year versus production, and how we 
should think about that relative to the previous comments?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

 


had to spend a lot more time making sure we got the Model S right, and it 
took longer to get to some of the international markets and what not. So it 
just
 

Model S house in order. I think we're in pretty good shape on the S front, so 
our focus is very heavily on the X, and just making sure it's a phenomenal 
product. And, we expect to be
 
varying production cars roughly Q2 next year.
 
We'll have the production design articles, I guess beta articles or production
-
release candidates around the end of this year, but we want to make sure 
we've got a decent period of validation with those releas
e
-
candidate 
vehicles, because the production ramp for Model X will be much greater than 
for S, so much deeper. So with S we have quite a shallow production ramp, 
start off real slow and as we encountered issues we were able to correct 
them without having a
 
large number of cars in production on the roads.
 
With X it's going to be sharp ramp, which means we really need to make 
sure that we've properly validated issues and made sure in all temperatures 
and climates and road types that the car is really 
solid before ramping up 
production. Otherwise, we would risk having a recall or a bad customer 
experience.
 
Colin W. Rusch 

 
Northland Capital Markets
 
Okay. And then one quick technical question. As you look at the components 
and the materials inside of you
r cells, the quality of lithium, how much 
leverage do you think you can get as you start to see higher
-
quality lithium 
from the supply chain?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
The quality of lithium 

 

 
Colin W. Rusch 

 
Northland Capital Markets
 
Just in te
rms of higher purity, I should say.
 
Elon R. Musk
 

-
off or driver of 
performance. It's something that we're constantly looking at with the 
different the different suppliers and trading off different proc
essing 
mechanisms and different feed stocks that can affect the pricing; the 

 
Colin W. Rusch 

 
Northland Capital Markets
 
Yes.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
There are some things that are sort of a tricky 

 
or that matter, like for 
example the anode, the structure of the carbon in the anode is important. I 
mean we use a very high percentage of synthetic graphite, because that 
gets sort of a more precise microstructure. And, yes, so there is some 
potential tra
de
-
offs there as to how much work effort you put into creating 
the synthetic graphite. I think generally we want to probably aim for highly 

have random microstructures, stuff
 
that came out of the ground.

Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Merrill Lynch. Your line is 
open.
 
John D. Lovallo 

 
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
 
Hey g
uys. Thank you very much for taking my call. First question is, we've 
recently had conversations with several of your customers in China and 
Hong Kong who have placed firm orders, pretty high trim levels, and now 
are actually seeking refunds because what t
hey've discovered is that the 
electric wiring at the residential level is so poor that charging equipment is 
not being permitted in their high
-
rise buildings. The question is I mean are 
these kind of one
-
off exceptions, or are you guys seeing a trend in th
is?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

one of the things we have required of customers who place the deposit is 
that we want to before they take delivery of their car, we want to make sure 
that they h
ave wall connector installed, but usually like the wire 
configuration is like what max amperage the outlet can be. Some places may 
be able to handle an 80
-

pretty unusual see this. Something we are doing in China
, another possibility 
is we're putting Superchargers in cities, not just between cities. This is 
obviously important in places like, you know, Beijing, Shanghai, London, San 
Francisco, New York, where at times people may have a challenge with 
having a fixe

like some of those people don't have a definitive parking space, they might 
have street parking or something. London is particularly tricky one; where 
there's 

 

-
end neigh
borhoods just have street parking.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
If I might add, there's been a lot of questions about the supposed poor 
quality of the grid in China, but from what we've seen, installing hard
-
wired 
charging equipment and Superchargers, it's actually been s
omewhat the 
opposite, and been quite a robust, very new actually new equipment, new 
grid. So we have not seen very many problems.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, no exactly. In fact it's exactly as J. B. said. We've actually found 

 
it's 
been a positive surprise for us 
in China, not a negative one.
 
John D. Lovallo 

 
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
 
Okay. And then for my second question, I think in the release you 
mentioned that North American deliveries were up I think 10% sequentially. 
So this would still imp
ly they were lower for the first quarter and the second 
quarter of 2013, and about in line with the third quarter. Is that a fair 
characterization?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Jeff do you want to answer this one?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
Yes, John, just to clarify, we 
said the orders in North America were up 10%, 
not deliveries.
 
John D. Lovallo 

 
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
 
Okay, but how were the deliveries in the quarter in North America?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
The deliveries were down. We were trying to r
educe the lead time in Europe. 
We had a long lead time there, and we were shipping a lot of cars into 
Europe, so that we come to a more even lead time between North America 
and Europe.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, and I think this is getting back to that what is stil
l not early, this 

 

confuse deliveries with demand, deliveries and demand are not the same 
thing for Tesla. They are for other car companies but not Tesla.
 
John D. Lovallo 

 
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks very much guys.
 
El
on R. Musk
 
I mean particularly we are seeing a steadily increasing demand in North 
America and so, yes.

Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. You
r line is 
open.
 
Rod A. Lache 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hey, everybody. It seems like you're making a lot of progress in terms of 
purchased material and efficiency. Just looking at the numbers and what I'm 
looking at is it looks like your product's g
ross profit, you reported like $190 
million last quarter, but there was a gain in there, so maybe it was $180 
million in Q4 and then this quarter you did $180 million including a charge. 
It seems like your gross profit didn't move, even though your revenue
 
was 
down. I'm just hoping that you can maybe give us a little bit of an update on 
where your incremental margins stand today, just given some of the 
progress that you've made. In a steady
-
state basis, these incremental units, 
what kind of conversion for i
ncremental volume do you achieve to
-
date on 
the gross profit line?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
Rod I'm not exactly clear what your question is, but I think to broader point 

improvements that we
 
continue to achieve and this is the internal road map 
that we have on a variety of actions to achieve material cost reduction some 
internally, some at our suppliers, some through design and those actions will 

 
feel comfortable that we will 
achieve 28% gross margin by Q4.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes there is I think a couple of important points I would like to make here 

product worse, so that doe

tempting do that sometime and that drives me crazy when companies and 
other elsewhere in the car industry or other industries reduced cost by 

e really in 
that like figuring out how to get the molecules in the right shape in a 
smarter way as I appose to trying to sort of strip value out, in fact in 

something that needed to be i
mproved, you know the under
-
body shield is 
an example of that.
 
And our gross margin in Q1 will be 

 
we have a number of charges against 

 
that negatively affected gross margin, would have been a little bit higher if it 

ple, the under
-
body shield activity. I 
think we feel fairly comfortable of achieving the 28% gross margin by the 
end of the year on the Model S front.
 
Rod A. Lache 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay, thanks. And you indicated again, in your release $650
 
million to $850 
million of CapEx this year. Can you give us some high
-
level thoughts on 

the gigafactory, and also, I know that you made some reference to SG&A 
and R&D as a percenta
ge of sales, but I guess for your stage of 

idea of how that might look on an absolute basis?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 

2015 CapEx, 
clearly 2015 at a high level will be dominated by spending on the gigafactory 
as well as we start to prepare for Gen 3, I think much of Model S and Model 
X spending will be behind us, there will be some lagging Model X spending 
from a CapEx per
spective, just before launch from a tooling and an 
equipment perspective.
 
So there will be a small change or there will be a change in the 
categorization of spending. And then beyond that, clearly we will continue to 
expand rapidly, globally with our 
store service centers and Superchargers, 
so that growth will continue, but I think we can provide you a bit more 
clarity on that, perhaps a couple of quarters from now.
 
Rod A. Lache 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. And just last one on China. When yo
u do actually expand to domestic 
production, do those requirements for 50
-
50 JV partners, do they apply to 
you, or are there any exceptions for new energy vehicles, or do you actually 
have any thoughts on that at this point?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 

s too early to make a prediction on that front. Yes, so I think we 
can't say for sure what 

 



two

service and super
-

anything to say on that front yet.

Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Your line is 
open.
 
Ben J. Kallo 

 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
All right. Thanks for taking my question. Back to the battery factory, can you
 
talk about the costs associated with running two sites in parallel, maybe 
three, and any optionality you have there? And then adding maybe two 
more on top of it, one is, how much work have you done as far as business 
development with stationary stores to 
get comfortable with that angle there, 
and then as far as additional investors, should we wait to see them after 

 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
There is I mean 

 
your first question was fundamentally are we 
spending too 
much money by working on three sites together. I think as Elon has said a 

on time to supply the sales for Gen 3. And that delay, every one month 
delay at that poi
nt is far more expensive for us than the incremental costs 
that we may incur up front to kick off two sites at one
-
time.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes. Maybe, I can speak to the stationary business development part of the 
question. We have done a huge amount of effort 
there, work there, and 


on is our long
-
term optimism looking at the price, versus cost of what we 
exp
ect we could do. And the demand for 

 
the long
-
term demand for 
stationary energy storage is quite extraordinary. When you look at the size 
of the grid and what needs to be done with renewable energy and buffering 

really where we keep our focus is on 
the long
-
term economics that could be enabled once the gigafactory is 
online.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel
 
Yes. Right I would not try to build demand for stationary storage, because 
we have cell constrains, so kind of expense of
 

right now is more on the engineering side figuring out what would be a really 
cool stationary storage pack that could be produced at volume and that 
could be combined, so you could stack the whole bunch of them if you 
wanted.
 
I think particularly for the home solution, I mean sort of thing, we have in 
mind is, something that looks a bit like the battery pack from the Model S, 


 
is coming five inches off the 
wall, like wall mounted
 
in a nice in a beautiful cover, integrated bidirectional 

stationary storage pack on the residential front, which could conceivably you 
could stack a bunch of them and have it looks
 
commercially as well. But 
play, I mean I want to talk about that in detail end of the year, early next 
year, or something like that.
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Yes, I think the third part of your question was about other participants in 
the gigafactory. we are talking 
to various different people in parallel. I think 


complementary, different pieces of the production operatio
n. those

Irwin 

 
Wedbush Securities, Inc.
 
Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Elon, when you look at the 
Chinese market, everybody knows that this is the largest luxury automotive 

s we 
might like. How do you quantify the total opportunity for sales for Tesla, and 
what have you seen since you launched in China that surprised you, or 

store 

 
your store map over t
here, and the obvious service centers and 
other investments?
 
Elon R. Musk
 

for our cars in China. So as far as it's an incredible crystal ball. as you 
mentioned, China is the biggest 
market for cars in the world, and actually 
the biggest market for premium sedans in the world. So to the degree that 
our sales track that of other manufacturers presumably China would over 
time become the biggest market for Tesla.
 

probably the best guess that anyone could make at this point, 
or in the short
-
term is that we really don't have a demand issue in China like 


ry to roll out service centers and 
superchargers as fast as we can. And my instructions to the China team are 

is happening.

Rahul X. Chadha 

 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Hi this is Rahul Chadha on behalf of 
Colin. Can you help us understand the 
difference in the variable cost structure for the Model S, compared to a 
comparable luxury sedan like maybe a BMW 7 Series. And other than 

ah
ead and achieve scale?
 
Elon R. Musk
 



 
as cost 
reduction, the cost of our vehicle is not just in the battery pack, battery pack 
is one portion of the car, but it maybe a quarter to the value of the car, its 
not like 

 
its not the overwhelming portion of the car. So cost reductions 
really come 
across the board.
 
Rahul X. Chadha 

 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Are there any specific components which you see a bigger opportunity to cut 
cost and or the process?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
I think a single cost reduction with same Q4 this year would be related to 
labor and ov
erhead, which I guess as mentioned earlier in the call we have a 


making the car with greater labor efficiency 
is the biggest single 
improvement, but there are really hundreds of improvements across the 
board and really comes on to this you make you know from like a $5 to $100 
improvement here, there and everywhere and it adds up to a significant 
number. I wish the
re was like one place where was one incredibly super 
expensive thing that if we fixed would suddenly make car cheap that is 
preference and not the case.
 
Rahul X. Chadha 

 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Thank you, and then do you have any update on the dispute with dea
ler 
body?
 
Elon R. Musk
 
Well I think there was something that happened just today, I mean the stuff 
tends to be reported real time, so we are sort of like just I mean we know 
that, there is not public information, but I think the appeal in Massachusetts 
fro
m the dealers was denied today. So there was 

 
hearing there is a

comment in the shareholder letter about 10% sequential growth in orders in

you have got great demand, but one of the points of controversy is the 
potential for declining shipments into North America. Can you maybe give us 
a commentary about your year

2/21/13,Tesla,"Thank you. So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges 
in the final few weeks. This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP 
net income in a seasonally weak first quarter. Even with all the challenges, 
we achieved a 20% 
automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits 
while ramping two major products. What we've learned from this is that 
--
 
we've obviously learned a lot here. After the Model 3 ramp from three years 
ago, our new products get run faster and become prof
itable sooner.
 
In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in 
Fremont in the first two quarters. Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even 
faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. Most surprisingly, as otherwise, 
we are ahead of the
 
schedule that we were ahead of already. Most 
surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, 
something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
 
Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic li
ghts and 
stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full 
Self
-
Driving package just last week. Our cars will not automatically stop at 
each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed. 
I should sa
y that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we 
are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we 
feel it is probably a safety improvement.
 
We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at t
his 
point. This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update 
and as more people start driving again. Soon, we will be collecting data from 
over 1 billion intersections per month.
 
All of those confirmations are training under old methods. Es
sentially, the 
driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling 
--
 
the labeling 
reality as they drive and making them better and better. I think this is an 
advantage that no one else has, and we're quite literally orders of magnitude 
more than
 
everyone else combined.
 

difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because 
everyone is training Google all the time with their searches. So, when you're 
searc
hing something and you click on a link, you're training Google every 
time you do that. It's very difficult for any new search engine to compete on 
that basis.
 
So, all those confirmations of training and all that, and certain cars will be 
able to drive thro
ugh an intersection without a confirmation as well as to 
make turns. And we really feel we're 
--
 
I feel extremely confident that it 
would be possible to do a drive from your home to your office most of the 
time with no interventions by the end of the year.
 
So, this is 
--
 
we can 
almost do this already with the leading
-
edge Alpha [indiscernible] driving the 
car.
 
So let's see. On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S 
and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Mod
el 
X. Actually, we said that, actually, the model 
--
 
the real Model S range is 
400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, ATA left the car 
door open and the keys in the car, so the car 
-
 
and it did this overnight.
 
And so the car actually 
went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its 
range. And as a result, it had a 391 test. As soon as the EPA reopens for 
testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually confident that we will 
achieve a 400
-
mile
-
or
-
greater range with the Model S. B
ut to be clear, the 
Model S, for the past two months 
--
 
the true range of the Model S for the 
past two months has been 400 miles.
 
And of course, we're not stopping there. We're looking forward to continuing 
pushing for improved range over time and improvin
g handling, acceleration 
and all those details that make Tesla special.
 
For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two
-
piece 
--
 
we're underway 
casting that we are going to be making a single
-
piece casting later this year, 
meaning like essentially the rear 
third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
 
In fact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the two
-
piece casting 
for the Model Y. So, we're really pushing the envelope on ve
hicle structural 
engineering and manufacturing. I'm very excited about this approach as it 
allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH. It's better in 
every way essentially.
 
For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, whic
h 
allows the car to have a higher range. So Model Y has remarkable range on 
par with 
--
 
in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3 and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more. And the heat pump is a key contributor 
to that. It is especiall
y excellent at low
-
temperature driving. So 
--
 
and the 
feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus 
far has been universally positive. We're confident this product will be our 
best
-
selling product ever.
 
So in conclusion, and just
 
to 
--
 
looking forward, I guess this is a forward
-
looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity 
expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in 
Fremont when they will let us continue.
 
Localized production in 
China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making 
our products even more competitive over time. While many other companies 
are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite. We're absolutely 
pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the c
ompany.
 
And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly 
global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and 
Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year. So there's a 
tremendous amount to look forward 
to and we can't wait to tell you what's 
going to happen. Thank you.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. And now to Zach's opening remarks.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon. I'm very proud of the 
accomplishments of the Tesla team this past 
quarter. A few things to 
highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned. We successfully launched, 
ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, 
significantly ahead of schedule. This is our second large
-
scale product launch 
since 
Model 3 in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost 
control and ramp efficiency.
 
It's hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this 
program in its first quarter of production. Our Shanghai Model 3 margins 
impro
ved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s 
built in Fremont. This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also 
managing through the production shutdown in early February.
 
We also announced a long
-
range and performanc
e variant of Model 3 for our 
road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China. On order rates, we did 
not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government 
incentives at the end of Q4. In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest
-
ever backlog yet again.
 
Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first
-
ever Q1 
profit. Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, 
remained strong for all products, despite charges taken in Q1 associated 
with prod
uction downtime. We continue to make progress on OpEx 
efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
 
Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 
limiting deployments. We also experienced expected launch efficiencies 
associa
ted with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overall 
profitability.
 
As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we 
sell to other carmakers to generally increase with time. This can be seen by 
the increase from
 
Q1 relative to Q4. And note that most of the credit 
revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
 
Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary 

 
by the temporary 
increase in end of quar
ter inventory for all our products resulting from the 
abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations. Had these 
interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of 
deliveries and strong free cash flows.
 
As Elon mentioned, it is 
extremely important that we remain on track to 
achieve our long
-
term plans and technology road map. We are taking the 
near
-
term actions required to continue those investments. Model Y in 
Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progre
ss 
on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai.
 
In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an 
increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the company. In Fremont, 
we're working towards restarti
ng production as soon as that's possible. We 
are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end 
of the first quarter.
 
Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, 
which was a headwind to free cash 
flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2. Note 
that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in 
Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally 
producing and delivering vehicles.
 
While sales and delivery operati
ons have paused in many areas of the world, 
we are still receiving many online orders, despite inability for our customers 
to experience the product prior to ordering. However, unavoidably, the 
extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near
-
t
erm 
financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be 
able to ramp production to prior levels.
 
More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed 
appropriately. Working capital management, in particular, raw ma
terial 
inventory is the single most important lever in managing our cash flows 
during this time. The Tesla team has done a great job here. We've also 
taken actions to eliminate or reduce non
-
critical expenses and optional 
investments while continuing to dr
ive efficiencies throughout the business.
 
Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable 
that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important, 
long
-
term investments. It is important to note that Tesla remains a
n 
extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the substantial 
work we've done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and 
productivity. And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and 
planning as required.
 
So thank you ag
ain to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to 
questions.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. So we'll take the first questions from institutional 
investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
A 
-
 
Martin Viecha
 
The first
 
question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet 
to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having all the 
necessary hardware. What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and 
deepen your data advantage? For example, coul
d you consider offering FSD 
as a premium subscription?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think we will offer Full Self
-
Driving as a subscription service, but it will be 
probably towards the end of this year. I should say, it will still make sense to 
buy FSD as an option as in o
ur view, buying FSD is an investment in the 
future. And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the 
consumer 
--
 
to the benefit of the consumer. In my opinion, buying FSD 
option is something people will not regret doing.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Agree. And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your 
--
 
of the FSD 
option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is 

 
will be the least expensive 
plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of 
increased value of time. So we d
o understand that some customers who 
have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option 
upfront. And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of 
ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, absolutely.
 
At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area 
under the curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. And we think that, 
that's the kind of thing that all companies should try to do. And it's what 
results in long
-
term value creation and loyal
ty 

 
the guest loyalty. So our 
goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're 
confident that if we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the 
same way to us.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. The second question from investors 
is, China recently announced 
changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from 
benefiting from the subsidies. To what extent is there room for Tesla to 
lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so they 
can q
ualify for the subsidy?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in 
China. And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be 
reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow, China
 
time. So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time. 
And there will be a price below the subsidy limit. And we feel confident that 
that's will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. And on the ma
nufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of 
vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to 
produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left 
to take costs out. So fixed cost absorption from high
er production volumes, 
which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year were 
not fully localized on the supply chain yet. And so while a lot of the supply 
chain is localized, it's not complete, and there's additional opportunities 
ther
e. And so we'll continue to bring the price down and expand margin 
--
 
costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elon 
mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. The next question is, Andy Grove
 
once said that great companies 
are improved by crisis. In which way has Tesla improved towards 
--
 
or is 
expected to improve coming out of COVID
-
19?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more 
efficient as a compan
y. That's one always has to do that in a crisis, and just 
thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do. And we came to 
a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand 
rapidly, continue to invest in the future and in new 
technologies, even 
though it is risky. And we've talked to some of our key investors, and they 
support that approach as well. So I think that there's clearly an uncertain 
future ahead. It's a bit of a bumpy road. But I think the long
-
term prospects 
are ext
remely good. Anything you guys want to add?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, I agree with Elon. The prioritization on the key projects will enable us 
to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think is great. The 
other one that I would add is, it's alwa
ys been our vision at Tesla to improve 
the customer experience and make that as digital as possible.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Touchless delivery.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah, So touchless delivery. Mobile service touchless sales has been 
something that we've been very 
focused on and made a lot of progress on.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five 
minutes on your phone, you can order a car and have it delivered to your 
doorstep with all the paper and everything done. That
's it. Effortless.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And many customers do that.
 
Elon Musk
 
And they're doing it, yes. In fact, a big part of it is just trying to 
communicate to people that this is something you can do, because normally, 
buying a car is quite a pain 
--
 
for 
most people, they would rather go to the 
dentist than buy a new car. Actually, my dentist is very 
--
 
but it's really like 
quite an arduous thing. When the typical retail experience for buying a new 
car is more painful to people than having a root canal don
e, then you have 
to say, well 
--
 
and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something 
from the Apple App Store or something on Amazon and 
--
 
except it's a car. 
Yes. All right. And then five minutes is a, if you really went fast, I think you 
could 
order a car probably in 90 seconds, so.
 
Martin Viecha
 
The next question is from institutional investor is, can you give us a brief 
preview of the Battery Day by generally highlighting steps Tesla is taking to 
improve cell energy density and time line for i
ntroduction?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Actually, we were just 
--
 
we don't want to preempt Battery Day. We 
want to leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of 
exciting news to tell. And I think it would be one of the most exciting days in 
Tesla's 
history and we're just trying to figure out the right timing for that. 
We think probably the right timing will be the 
--
 
probably the third week of 
May. Not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that's the right 
timing. And depending upon what we'
re allowed to do, it will either be in 
California or Texas.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. And the last question from institutional investors, could you please 
update on progress stores development and commercialization of Full Self
-
Driving? How much revenue have you
 
recognized so far?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
So there is a couple of things on the financials for Full Self
-
Driving. And so, 
currently, in North America, it's sold for $7,000 as an option. We take 
roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of it goes into
 
deferred 
revenue. That's associated with features that will be released with time.
 
Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It's a little bit over $600 
million. And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, 
we take a loo
k at what features have been released associated value and 
then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for 
that quarter.
 
And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize 
that revenue. So we reduce the a
mount of deferral, and we can recognize 
that revenue within period. So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be 
one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the feature suite 
is rolled out.
 
Elon Musk
 
Absolutely. There's also a tremendous 
amount of untapped potential in the 
beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot 
--
 
basic Autopilot or 
Full Self
-
Driving. And that's something we will enable just as simple in our 
purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of th
e year, as 
a subscription.
 
So that's just a lot of untapped potential there. That's not in the deferred 
revenue line, obviously, but it's certainly a great deal deferred potential that 
we think is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
 
Martin 
Viecha
 
Thank you. And now let's go through the questions from retail investors. 
Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth 
target for Tesla in the past. Is this still in line with Tesla's ambitions for the 
next five to 10 years? T
his would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more 
than 20 million vehicles in 2030. Is 40% or more realistic target?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be. I 
think people 

 
actually people would have predic
ted the unexpected 
roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of came out of nowhere. So I 
think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but 
quite massive, I think, 40% is the likely number. It's possible that is 40%. I 
would be ver
y shocked, if it's less than 40%, even with force majeure Model 
3.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. The next question from retail investors. When will you announce the 
next Giga? How many Gigas, do you have planned for the next five years?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think we will 
announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month. We may 
not 

 
as soon as next month. This is not a prediction, just saying. That's 

 
that could happen. It will certainly be within three months and possibly one 
month. And that would be in the U.S. So as 
for how many will be in five 
years, I'm not 

 
I don't know right now what that number would be. I guess, 
several more than there are today. But I'm not sure, what exactly it would 
be in five years, but some number more than today.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
I'll als
o add that our Gigas have gotten bigger. And 
--
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Larger, they start being called Tera.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes, with multiple products as well. And so the absolute number of Giga 
factories, we may ultimately build might be less, but each one is 
larger. And 
that's under our belief that just significant efficiencies by having as much as 
possible, and similar product lines under the same roof, and as much vertical 
integration as possible all in one facility.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. The next questio
n is, can you give us an update on Solar Roof 
ramp? How many are you currently able to install per week? What is your 
installations per week target for the end of 2021?
 
Elon Musk
 
We were actually gaining interest momentum with the Solar Roof before 
COVID, 
but COVID essentially shut us down, both from the ability to install 
and the ability to get permits. The permit offices were closed. And we're 
sheltering places, 11 places. So we obviously cannot install and the 

 
if you 
can't get permits, then you can't p
hysically do it. It's basically impossible. So 

 
but I think the long
-
term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I'm 
confident that, let's say, within the next, I don't know, year or

maybe even 
by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of 1,0
00 a week. That's not 
in the middle of winter or something, like taking seasonality 

 
allowing for 
seasonality, where it's hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and 
ice. But like, say spring, I think it's installing, which is the hard part. We 
actually have demonstrated the ability to hit 1,000 a week plus build rate for 
the Solar Glass Roof already. So that's not a problem. It's building out the 
installed teams, building up the third
-
party channel installers, the roofing 
industry installers.
 
An
d internally, we want to have at least 1,000 Solar Roof install teams with 

 
and taking a week or perhaps a little less than a week to do an install, 
which gets you 1,000 a week roof installations. We see demand is good. 
Production is good. So it's really 
all about the install, and then like also build 
out the training, the very diverse group of companies in the roofing industry 
to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale 

 
allow us to scale far beyond 
1,000 a week.
 
We're also seeing a lot of intere
st outside of North America. So we expect 
this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous 
amount of interest from China on the Solar Roof. So we're confident this will 
be a very significant product for the company over time.

Thank you. The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla's plan to enter 
the residential and/or commercial HVAC market? Can you provide some 
basics of how your system will work? Will you consider the heat pump water 
heater market as well?
 
Elo
n Musk
 
Well, as I said on Twitter, I'm personally extremely excited to build HVAC 

 
gas, HVAC system that also has sort of hospital
-
grade particle filtration, 
basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralize
s specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient. And these 
are all things we've achieved in our cars. In fact, I don't know if a lot of 
people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room
-
grade heavy fil
ters built
-
in. They're very big. So 

 
but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
And 3 and Y have like MERV 16 or 15 capable filter 

 
Elon Musk
 


 
Model 3 and Y also 

 
they're w
ay better 
than any other cars to the best of my knowledge. They're not quite as good 
as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than 
any other normal car. And we're continuing to improve the filters on 3 and Y. 
These actually have 
a big effect on health even in normal just day
-
to
-
day 
living. It's reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts 
of things. So it's really 

 
air quality is incredibly important even in non
-
COVID situations going forward.
 
So taking al
l those things that we've replenished and applying to how HVAC 
would be and commercial HVAC would be is just very exciting. And then 
you've got 

 
if you're condensing water, like why not also have a few water 
source, if you have water, you possibly could t
hen heat the water and have 
a water heater as well.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah. And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, 
when the outdoor is really cold or the other way around. So lots of options.
 
Elon Musk
 
It could be a hell of a p
roduct. So we just have to 

 
Tesla have potentially to 
whether we continue on the product front. So we're going to make sure, we 
got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, 
new Roadster and the Gigafactories in various pa
rts of the world and Model 

 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
New technologies.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, exactly. Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack. We are seeing tremendous 
demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for 
2020.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start 
acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and most lending instead of 
selling them battery storage? Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger 
plants and 
convert them?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we haven't really thought about that yet. It's not out of the question, 
but our brand is full. Excuse me, sir, our brand is full. That's not out of the 
question. Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of 
sustainable energy. And the three elements of that are sustainable power 
generation, then you've got to store the power, stationary storage. And then 
you've got to have electric transportation.
 
So 
--
 
and we don't have, like, say, specific market share goal
s or anything 
like that. It's just to the degree that we can accelerate the advent of 
sustainable energy, we think that's a fundamental good for the world, and 
we want to do that as fast as possible. But it's not, like you said, market 
share growth is a go
al in and of itself. It's just the faster this happens, the 
better the world will do.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. And I think now we can move to analyst questions.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Please go ahead.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Thanks everybody. I hope everyone's safe and healthy. I got one question, 
one follow
-
up. And I'd point out, I've had a root canal before, and I would 
agree, Elon. It was less painful than buying a car.
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean, really,
 
it's 
--
 
yeah, exactly.
 
Adam Jonas
 
It's a big problem, actually. It's a big problem. Different conversations. 
Zach, first for you, any real
-
time update on company liquidity at the end of 
April? Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their
 
way 
to give a little color on that. I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got 
a follow
-
up.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yeah. It's a fair question. I don't have any additional color to provide. So 
$8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1, we
're managing it 
very closely. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase 
in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver at the end of Q1. So 
we're making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for 
liquidity.
 
An
d as we've been looking at liquidity, we've been looking at this over the 
next 18 months, and there's ups and downs to the liquidity. Currently now, 
as we're not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we're paying off. 
But then in a couple of month
s, we'll quickly be through that, and then we'll 
have a gap in payables since we don't have any parts coming in. So it does 
go up and down a little bit. But in looking at the long
-
term horizon, which is 
how we're managing it right now, we feel pretty comfo
rtable with the 
liquidity position of the company.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah. I should say we are a bit worried about not being able to resume 
production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk. 
We only have two car factories right now, one i
n Shanghai and one in the 
Bay Area, and the Bay Area produces the vast majority of our cars, all of S 
and X, and most of the 3 and all of the Y.
 
So the extension of the shelter in place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly 
imprisoning people in their hom
es against all their constitutional rights, that 
in my opinion, and breaking people's freedoms in ways that are horrible and 
wrong is not why people came to America or built this country, what the 
fuck? Excuse me. But outrage 
--
 

--
 
but 
it will cause great 
harm, not just to Tesla, but to many companies. And while Tesla will 
weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not. And all 
peoples 
--
 
everything people have worked for their whole life is going to get 
--
 
is being dest
royed in real time. And we're going to have many suppliers 
--
 
or have many suppliers that are having super hard times, especially the 
small ones, and it's causing a lot of strife to a lot of people. Yes.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Elon, on that point, you mentioned people
 
that gave their lives to build the 
country. My fault for you on this. There have been a lot of comparisons 
drawn to the state of the U.S. economy in the early 1930s when Roosevelt 
began a series of new deals and infrastructure projects or post
-
World War 2
 
when Eisenhower launched the U.S. Highway Act and JFK launched the 
Apollo Program, which you could say was influenced by the Cold War, 
clearly, and you benefited from and our space program benefited from. What 
would be your message to U.S. lawmakers on th
is call as we 

 
in addition to 
your opinion on shelter in place, but thinking the longer term, your message 
to U.S. lawmakers coming out of the crisis, specifically around EV 
infrastructure and a chance to work with taxpayers to support sustainable 
transpo
rt and renewable energy? I'm wondering if you see this as a chance 
to make the crisis and all the loss and lives lost not be in vain. Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 
I think, it's high time we invested in infrastructure in this country. We have a 
lot of a 
crumbling highways and bridges. And frankly, when I visit China, I 
see their infrastructure as being much better than ours. It's great. Europe 
has better infrastructure. It's really quite sad that U.S. infrastructure 

here it is today. And our airports, in a 
lot of cases, are an embarrassment.
 
So 
--
 
and it's not just a question of money. It's a question of will. 
Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we 
gaining for it? So 
--
 
and yeah, we really
 
need to be thinking about what is 
the transportation of the future, not the transportation of the past.
 
If this was 1920, do you want to be investing in steam engines or in 

to thi
nk about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people's 
rights, as what is happening right now. I think the people are going to be 
very angry about this and are very angry, because somebody should really 
-
-
 
if somebody wants to stay in t
heir house, that's great. They should be 
allowed to stay in the house, and they should not be compelled to leave. But 
to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they 
do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not free
dom. Give people 
back their goddamn freedom.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Let's go to the next question please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche 
Bank. Please go ahead.
 
Emmanuel Rosner
 
Hi, good evening. Question on Model
 
Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a 
little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at 
such low volume. How much of it is a function of the commonality with the 
Model 3, what other factors should we think about? And what does th
at 
mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?
 
Elon Musk
 
Zach?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Sure. A couple of thoughts there for Y. The first is, it does carry a higher 
ASP. So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3. And the 
deli
veries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars. 
So we started with deliveries of performance initially. And so that helps 
create some of the margin. And that will come down with time as more 
variants are released, and we have more 
of a steady
-
state mix. But it's 
similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3 when we launched that 
product in Fremont two years ago. On the cost side, I think you hit on a 
couple of the buckets. The commonality is huge. It's very important.
 
And in ad
dition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 
as well, and so we have experience with that both with Model 3 in Fremont 
and then as well in Shanghai. And it helps to have an existing factory with 
existing workforce and knowledge here 
as well. So the ecosystem to support 
and launch the product is there. There remain a lot of opportunities to take 
-
-
 
continue to take costs out of the car. And the number of vehicles that we 
built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
 
Elon Musk
 
It's good. We take costs out of the car and to make the product better. So 
it's tax. It's not make the product worse. It's 
--
 
and if we can take costs out 
of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how 
we can make 
it lighter and simpler. And so it's 
--
 
want the car to just 
incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs. But for a five
-
seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the 
Model 3 once we have reached say, 10,000 
or 20,000 units or something 

 
Operator
 
Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, your conference will resume 
momentarily. Thank you. Speakers, you're back online.
 
Martin Viecha
 
All right. Sorry, we got disconnected for some
 
reason. What was the 
question again? Okay. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Please go ahead.
 
Ben Kallo
 
Hey, thank you very much. Just wondering about the cell strategy. In Reno, 
you have, o
bviously, integrated there. But you're buying cells I think, in 
Shanghai and then what we think in Germany. And so, how are you looking 
at that going forward? And then could you just talk about Mr. Mizuho and 
that Board addition and kind of the process wit
h adding him to the Board? 
Thank you.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Sure. From a sales perspective, with all the partners we've had historically in 
the future, we're just looking for competitive technology and competitive 
pricing. I think we'll talk a little bit more a
bout this on Battery Investor Day 
like how we're approaching all of it. But yes, I mean, we don't have like one 
model we're restricting ourselves to pursue. We're just trying to find what's 
best for the products and 
--
 
in the long run. And then the other q
uestion 
about the Board?
 
Martin Viecha
 
Sorry, we couldn't hear the second part of the question.
 
Ben Kallo
 
Yes. I was asking about Mr. Mizuho entering the Board and kind of the 
process behind that and what he brings to the Board?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think we all 
need to go. And obviously, he brings tremendous amount of 
experience investing at the highest levels in the world and has done great 
work as 
--
 
at the Japan Pension Fund, which is the largest fund of any kind 
in the world. And generally, the conversations 
over the years is just churning 
incredible insight into how the securities 
--
 
the global security markets work 
and what he thinks it is, whether are historical. It just 
--
 
it seems like he has 
a strong philosophical understanding about how to make the futu
re better. 
And he shares our view regarding the environment and just a very sensible, 
smart person who brings a lot to the Board and I think is generally 
recognized as such by many people.
 
Ben Kallo
 
I guess leaking into the Panasonic relationship, maybe ju
st how is that 
relationship going? And is there any read
-
through on bringing him on to the 
Board? Thank you.
 
Elon Musk
 
No. I think this is set right through with the Panasonic relationship. I mean, I 
have a great relationship with Panasonic's CEO. We meet 
regularly one on 
one and talk at the time. So, that relationship is strong. Just that he'd bring 
more of a broader and a global, strategic view to the Board.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Our next question will co
me from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures. Please 
go ahead.
 
Gene Munster
 
Congratulations on the progress. Elon, you talked about full autonomy by 
the end of the year. I would love for you to walk through the rollout strategy 
of the Tesla Network app and how 
that's going to look prior to the robo taxi 
stage? Are you going to gradually take over human routes with autonomous 
capable routes over time? Or how do you see that playing out?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, it's pretty much going to play out as it has played out, whic
h is, we'll 
release more and more functionality. Yes, before we release any 
functionality, it goes through extensive testing. First, we run it 
--
 
we have a 
simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world. 
So we run any car chan
ges through battery tests and simulation.
 
Then we have a global QA team, which I'm on, actually. I'm one of 
--
 
on the 
global QA team. And we test the releases in the real world, the essence of 
real
-
world in a simulation, which is 
--
 
which are very many, be
cause the 
world is very complex and where 
--
 
and then we release it to a small group 
of private beta testers within the company; then to a larger audience, 
including people outside the company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; 
and then finally, a broad r
elease.
 
And so there are many stages that these things go through. So, by the time 
something is being 
--
 
going to wide release into the U.S., it has gone 
through all of those stages. And the software that's at the very early stage is 
much more advanced tha
n what people are seeing. So, just going to go 
through a very rigorous safety process.
 
So essentially, we need to figure out, get very good at complex 
intersections, get very good at complex turns in intersections and things like 
busy malls, in a parking l
ot or office park or special events and sporting 
events, that kind of thing, when those eventually come back. Those are 
extra hard cases. But it's all tracking very well. If you like, the water pallets 
engineering team is 
--
 
we just have an extremely talen
ted group, and I'm 
deeply involved with the team. So we talk every week and meet every week 
when we can, as now physical meeting is difficult.
 
So I have quite a deep understanding where we are, where we're headed. 
And I feel like we have a tremendous amoun
t of momentum, and we'll have 

after that functionality is released, there's still another step, which is to 
improve the reliability of it, once it is released, to kind of core s
elf
-
driving 
with the human 
--
 
supervised by the driver. And then we keep improving the 
reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver.
 
And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is 
the case. And 
then presumably, the regulators, depending on which 
jurisdiction it is, would give approval for the autonomous cars that can drive 
with no human onboard. Obviously, the regulatory approval process that's 
difficult for us to predict with accuracy, because i
t's out of our hands. But for 
the rest of it, I feel very good about where we are.
 
Gene Munster
 
So, to summarize, we want 
--
 
we're going to give owners full autonomy, 
some level of that by the end of the year. Then a human is in the loop, Tesla 
Network app
 
sometime, is it first half of next year? Would that be the hope?
 
Elon Musk
 
Do you mean like, when can a car drive with no person?
 
Gene Munster
 
With a person 
--
 
initially a person who observes, would that be with the 
Tesla Network app, would that be really
 
part of the year of 2021? Is that the 
hope?
 
Elon Musk
 
If described as a hope, I would say that, that's probably a fair description.
 
Gene Munster
 
Okay. And then kind of take it to its end stage, the robo taxi stage. Any 
high
-
level thoughts to 
understand the regulatory is a massive unknown? But 
if you're going to put a guess on it, where would we 
--
 
when will we start 
seeing robo taxis?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I think it's quite likely, in my view, organic. I could be wrong. As you 
see, because we are a
head in some areas, and we're behind in others, 
because 
--
 
when I give a guess, I give the guess that I think is the likely 
midpoint, not the point with lots of margin. If this is normal distribution, I'd 
give you the 50th percentile, not the three segment
 
optimistic or pessimistic. 
So then that necessarily means, at least, half of my predictions will be wrong 
and half will be right. Yes. I think 
--
 
or it might be right, but offset by a few 
weeks to a few months, in some cases a few years. But I believe as 
everything I've ever said would come true 

 
did come true, it may come 
through late, but it did come true. So punctuality is not my strong suit, but I 
always come through in the end. So 

 
and I think we could see robo
-
taxi 
fleet in operation with the netwo
rk fleet next year. Not in all markets, but in 
some.

Operator
 
Our last question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street. Please go 
ahead.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Hey, thanks for taking my 
question. One on gross margin, first. I know your 
impressive performance in Q1. So there are three moving parts, the tailwind 
from credits, of course; the Model Y is ramping. Even if it broke even, it 
probably took average gross margin down. And of course,
 
you had like 
Fremont being closed, shut down the last week of the quarter. It probably 
was the sort of an extra cost. And so when I looked at how gross margin 
evolved sequentially, excluding these three moving parts, I felt like your 
auto gross margin cou
ld have been up like a couple of points sequentially. 
So I wanted to check with you, if that estimate would make sense. And then 
I will have a follow
-
up on energy storage. Thank you.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Sequential market improvement 

 
margin improvement.
 
Elon
 
Musk
 
Yes.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. So the three things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time 
hearing the full question here because we're having a bit of network 
difficulty in the room. I'll do my best here. So when we look at margin, we 
just
 
look at credits as you have, so I agree with that.
 
Model Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as 
well. So it was lower than the overall average, and that will increase with 
time. And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai a
nd in Fremont also 
weighed on margin. And the Shanghai margin was below the average as 
well. Even though it's increasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is 
below the average.
 
And so I think the sentiment of your question was, if you were to remov
e 
those factors, was there a sequential increase in gross margin. I haven't 
specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right. We saw 
strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned. And in particular, 
S and X gross margins contin
ue to improve despite slightly lower volumes 
there and higher fixed cost amortization.
 
So there's good progress happening, both on the ASP side and the cost 
reduction side, for our products and production. And I think this also lends 
itself to the power of
 
the gross profit contribution to the company once we 
get through these inefficiencies, we get them on up and running again, we 
increase capacity so we can spread out fixed costs and continue to execute 
on cost reductions on our products, we feel very opti
mistic about that path 
going forward.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Thanks. And I had a quick follow
-
up on energy storage, if you can hear me 
well. I think like 

 
I can't remember 

 
I think from the very first days I 
heard you on the call, you've always mentioned that de
mand for energy 
storage is always outstripping supply, and you have more orders than you 
can make. And so I'm kind of thinking there will be 

 
there should be an 
inflection point in that business at some point, and it's going to be driven by 
your ability t
o add much more manufacturing capacity like battery 
manufacturing capacity. And at a high level, how are you thinking about that 
inflection point in terms of time line?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
In terms of time line, I think what we've been doing with both our par
tners 
and internally is looking at how to reduce the 

 
fundamentally the cost of 
investments in new sales capacity because when you look at a car 

 
a 
vehicle product, there's a lot of things in the vehicle besides the cells. When 
you look at an energy stor
age product, it's really just the cells. And so to 
really grow the energy storage business, it's all about cell investments.
 
And so that's what we've been focused on. And I think not to give too much 
away, but that will be one of the things we address in B
attery Investor Day 
is how we're focused on that. And when we have that in the place we want, 
it will be a lot easier to scale that business.

11/6/12,Tesla,"Thanks, Martin. Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla 
history, but also the most successful. Thanks to the incredible work of the 
Tesla team, Model 3 became the best
-
selling premium vehicle in the U.S. for 
2018.
 
And in fact, when 
considering battery electric vehicles, Tesla achieved an 
80% market share of U.S. sales in the last year. I think this point is perhaps 
not well appreciated. All other electric vehicles combined were 20% of sales 
in the U.S. in last year. So I think that's
 
not so bad.
 
We also delivered 
-
 
also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years 
combined, which is tremendous achievement by the Tesla team. The 
-
 
if you 
track Tesla vehicle production year
-
over
-
year, cumulative sales and 
deliveries year
-
over
-
ye
ar, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen.
 
We've basically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as 
many cars as we did in all prior years. So this is a very unusual thing to see 
for 
-
 
especially for a large complex manufac
tured object, I think maybe the 
fastest that a complex manufactured object like a car has grown in history or 

 
Martin Viecha
 
I'm not sure. I think Model T was a little bit slower, but 
I'm not 100% sure.
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay. And we expect that exponential to continue. So with the deliveries this 
year being 
-
 
even in the face of 
-
 
if there's a global recession 
-
 
even if 
there's a global recession, we're expecting deliveries this year to be abo
ut 
50% higher than last year. And this 
-
 
it could be a lot more than that. But 
even with tough economic times, to see 50% growth is pretty nutty.
 
For Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability, the second quarter for the first time 
in the company history, and we i
ncreased our cash on hand by more than 
$700 million, even after paying debt [in EMEA] [ph] with the total of $3.7 
billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle our convertible 
bond that will mature in March.
 
In addition, our operating margin re
mains strong at 5.7%. Operating 
margins in the fourth quarter are usually lower in the automotive industry, 
but this was not the case with Tesla.
 
2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla. As I mentioned, we are 
expecting to increase sales by 50%. Perh
aps could be a lot more than 50%, 
but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. But that's crazy growth for the 
automotive industry.
 
I want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving 
service operations. So really, from my standpoint,
 
when I think about what 
my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service in North America. That's 
number one. And I think we have very exciting [indiscernible] we're going to 
roll out with the [indiscernible]. We're going to get cars to China and Eu
rope 
and make sure that we have good logistics for the whole delivery process, 
from factory gate to the customer.
 
That's obviously pretty far from California to get to Europe and China and 
make it to 
-
 
get the car to customers. So we're working every aspec
t of that 
logistics chain, and I think we've 
-
 
I think it's going to be good. I'd say at 
this point, I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1. Not by a lot, but I'm 
optimistic about being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.
 
So let's see
, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing out 
our total locations worldwide to 378. And we increased our Mobile Service 
fleet to 411 vehicles. Mobile Service fleet is something we can scale up very 
rapidly, because we don't need bricks an
d mortar, we can get more vehicles, 
hire people and deploy rapidly.
 
It also actually results from higher customer satisfaction, because we can 
actually send one of our service vans to your work or home and fix the car 
without you having to bring it into th
e service center or do any paperwork or 
anything like that. It's really seamless and invisible. The customers love it.
 
And we're also increasing the functionality of the Tesla App for service, so 
that instead of having to make an appointment 
-
 
to call and 
make an 
appointment, you just open your Tesla App, say you want to make a service 
appointment, and it was the top 10 most frequently requested service items, 
and you can 
-
 
with a couple of taps, you've made yourself an appointment.
 
And we're going to make 
it easier for the car to be picked up and dropped 
off as well. So if you want 
-
 
if you prefer not coming to the service center at 
all, you can just request that the car be picked up and delivered. That's 
something that we'll be 
-
 
so that's already 
-
 
we're 
going to roll it out and 
have a big improvement to customer satisfaction. It rolled out two or three 
weeks ago.
 
But the next thing we're going to add is, if a car detects something wrong, 
like a flat tire or a drive unit failure, that before the car has ev
en come to a 
halt, there is a tow truck and a service loader on the way.
 
The car has already notified Tesla emergency services, and a service loader, 
a tow truck, are on their way before your car has even come to a stop. I 
think this will be immense in imp
roving customer happiness.
 
[Indiscernible] call it and you have to tap the center screen to cancel it. So 
you can cancel it if you want. We just have to 
-
 
it's like automatically going 
to happen. You just press cancel.
 
We're also improving parts distributi
on. So I think we made a strategic error 
in the past about not having service parts located at our service centers. We 
had them in parts distribution warehouses, which basically meant it was 
impossible to have a fast turnaround on servicing a car, because 
the car 
would come in, then the parts will be requested, they come to the service 
center, this would basically 
-
 
even if they're very simple, repair could take 
days.
 
So we're going to be able to stock in all common parts at the service 
centers, so that it'
s possible to 
-
 
-
 
get your car serviced in 20 minutes or 15 
minutes, even if it's a simple matter. I mean, it should be like eight minutes 
or whatever, eight minutes. It should be like lightning fast. But in order to 
-
 
we have to have the parts located at 
our service centers.
 
Also, it's going to make sense for our service centers to do basic body work 
or essentially to replace a front or rear fascia, it makes sense to just 
prestock the front and rear fascia in the common colors. So unless you have 
an unusua
l color, we can literally replace your fascia in 15, 20 minutes, and 
this is not like, weeks at a body shop stuff.
 
In terms of the new products, with Model Y, we've completed ensuring of 
ensign of Model Y, and the parts are 
-
 
[indiscernible] for production
 
Model Y. 
Three quarters of the Model Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much 
lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3. And the risk is also quite low.
 
This is in contrast to Model S versus Model X where the theory was 
-
 
I think 
Model X, we just 
-
 
it's so
rt of Model X to be like the sort of the Fabergé egg 
of cars. It's an incredible vehicle and probably one 
-
 
probably nothing like it 
will ever be made again, and maybe it shouldn't. But it is a work of art. It's a 
special work of art.
 
But the commonality w
ith the Model S is limited. It was only about maybe 
30% in common with the Model S, whereas Model Y is, I think, 76% was 
what it got in common with the Model 3. And we're most likely going to put 
Model Y production right next to 
-
 
in fact, it's part of our
 
main Gigafactory in 
Nevada.
 
So it will just be right there. Batteries and powertrains will come out and go 
straight into the vehicle. So that also reduces our risk of execution and 
reduces the cost of having to transfer parts from California to Nevada. It
's 
not a for sure thing, but it's quite likely, and it's our default plan.
 
I would expect Model Y will probably be 
-
 
the [indiscernible] Model Y will be 
maybe 50% higher than Model 3, could be even double. The 
-
 
as I 
understand it, the midsized SUV segment
 
is the 
-
 
worldwide is the most 
popular type of vehicle. So we'll probably see a higher volume of Y than 3.
 
And earlier this month, we saw the construction of our Gigafactory in 
Shanghai, and by the end of this year, we expect to be producing Model 3s 
using a complete vehicle production line. That's body paint, final assembly, 
general assembly and module production.
 
So it basically would be 
-
 
this will be extremely fast. I get like daily updates 
of progress of the Shanghai Gigafactory, and those factori
es are going to go 
up like lightning.
 
So we do feel quite confident at this point, at least for the factories that are 
in our control, that we can achieve volume production in Shanghai by the 
end of the year. And that should allow us to get to the 10,000 v
ehicles a 
week rate or very close to it by the end of the year.
 
And yes, I think that's it.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay, great. So we're going to take the first questions from our retail 
investors who have been submitting their questions on say.com. So the 
question
 
that has been submitted has been about service, which I think you 
already spoke at length about. So let's go to the second question.
 
The second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now 
across the product line? Is 500,000 to 700,000 un
its at 42,000 ASP still a 
realistic annual target for Model 3, even considering Model Y and its impact 
on demand? And do you continue to see S and X demand of 100,000 
annually?
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand
 
of 
Model 3 worldwide is something 
-
 
in a strong economy, it's something on the 
order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year. That's my best guess for demand 
of Model 3 in a strong economy.
 
If the economy goes into a recession, then I think that could be somet
hing 
under 40% less. But I think even in a recession, worldwide demand is still 
something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3.
 
For S and X, we did eliminate the 75 [indiscernible] of S and X and product 
model differentiation relative to 3 and then Y that's
 
coming out. I think we 
could see a slight decline in total vehicles, but I think the net cash flow from 
S and X is likely to be very similar. So probably no major change in net cash 
flow for S and X.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. The next question from Alex is, can
 
you please share an update on full 
self
-
driving and Tesla Network development? When will customers start to 
see full self
-
driving features? What's the best case time line for a Tesla 
Network to go live?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. We have 
-
 
we already have full self
-
driving capability on highway. So 
from highway on ramp to highway exit, including passing cars and going 
from one highway interchange to another, full self
-
driving capability is there.
 
In a few weeks, we'll be pushing update that will allow the option of 
r
emoving stock confirmed in markets where regulators approve it, which we 
believe that will be the case in the U.S., for example. And over time, we 
think probably all regulators will approve it.
 
But we kept talking from there just to make sure that we took 
care of like 
-
 
of any strange corner cases. And it's really quite sublime if you have stock 
confirm of and like the car goes from highway on ramp, passes slower cars, 
change 
-
 
takes an interchange and then takes the exit and then comes to a 
stop after the 
exit. So it's really quite profound to have that experience.
 
Then the next part of full self
-
driving will really be to 
-
 
is traffic lights. It's 
hard. So stop streets are pretty easy because you can essentially geocode 
those and is recognized at all times.
 
Traffic lights and intersections will be the next really tricky one. And then 
navigating complex parking lots and like 
-
 
sort of like if you're underground 
in a mall parking lot with a lot of traffic and pedestrians and it's on multiple 
levels, that kind 
of thing is what gets tricky.
 
With the release of enhanced or advanced Summon, you'll see the first 
indications of the car being able to navigate complex parking lots, and that's 
also coming up fairly soon, probably next month. And in development mode, 
the
 
car does all the things that I just mentioned in development mode. It 
recognizes traffic lights and stop signs and basically has all the functionality 
in development mode. It's really just a question of getting your reliability of 
recognizing traffic ligh
ts to several names.
 
So I guess like, I don't know, 98% good right now, but we need it to be like 
99.999%, really extremely reliable. So 
-
 
and the capability will be there for 
-
 
when will we think it's safe for full self
-
driving? It's probably towards the 
end 
of this year, and then it's up to regulators to decide when they want to 
approve that.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Let's go to the next question, which is, if and when will Tesla switch 
Model S and X to 2170 battery cells? What percent range improvement do 
you
 
expect?
 
Elon Musk
 
We have no plans to switch S and X to 2170 and can't comment on huge 
product developments.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. So maybe we'll take the last question from retail investors, which was, 
where will Tesla Semi and Model Y be produced? Can you
 
share a time line 
on expected production ramp of these products?
 
Elon Musk
 
As I mentioned earlier, the Model Y, we think, most likely will be produced at 
Gigafactory, but that's 
-
 
unless we encounter some obstacle 
-
 
that's the 
default plan that we're 
proceeding towards. And it's fast, low risk and also 
low CapEx. In terms of the 
-
 
I mean, probably there's like initial production 
of Model Y, very low volume, probably next year.
 
But then it always takes time to ramp up any production system, and that's 
d
ifficult to predict the shape of that S
-
curve. So we feel confident in saying 
there will be production volume of Model Y by the end of next year, but in 
between beginning of next year with low volume, it always starts with very 
low growth exponentially 
-
 
f
rom beginning of last year to end of next year, 
it's difficult to break that ramp. So that's our expectation for Y. For Semi, 
we're 
-
 
I don't know if you want to comment on that, Jerome.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
I want to start next year as well.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Jero
me Guillen
 
But the first units will be 
-
 
this is Jerome. Well, first units will be for our own 
usage. So depends how many trucks we'll use for our own usage to move 
the parts and the vehicle in different location, and then we'll start delivering 
to outside
 
customers.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, that's good. And then the Tesla pickup truck, we might be ready to 
unveil that this summer. It will be something quite unique, unlike anything 
else.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. Fantastic. So operator, we can start taking questions from p
articipants 
on the call.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan 
Brinkman with JPMorgan.
 
Ryan Brinkman
 
Thanks for taking my question. I think 
-
 
the amount that you've spent on 
lands for Giga
factory Shanghai in the classification operating cash flows, is 
there any guidance you can provide us in terms of how to think about CapEx 
for this facility going forward? And can you discuss the source of funds for 
the project?
 
I think you've spoken in th
e past about the potential to raise that locally in 
China. Is that still your thinking? And what kind of terms might you be able 
to raise that capital?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, Deepak here. You're right. The purchase of the land is a 50
-
year lease 
with the govern
ment of China. So it's not CapEx, but it's operating lease, 
that shows up as cash flow from operations. However, the CapEx that we will 
invest is our equipment, and we fully own it. So that will show up as capital 
expenditures.
 
The plan, as we have indicat
ed in the letter, is still to get funding for 
majority of that capital spending from local China banks. And we expect 
pretty attractive rates based on the dialogue we've had. And there's a lot of 
interest. And we hope to finalize that and then share the de
tails at that 
point.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean, as a ballpark figure, probably it's something about 
-
 
something 
in the order of $0.5 billion in CapEx to get to the 3,000 vehicle rates in 
Shanghai, ballpark figure. And as Deepak was saying, [indiscernible] very
 
competitive debt financing in China, really extremely compelling interest 
rates, and we do not expect that to be a capital drain on the company.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes. These are the biggest banks in the world, and for them, $500 million is 
not a large amount o
f money on the scheme of things.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Loup 
Ventures.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sorry perhaps 
-
 

significant this is but maybe it's not as obvious to 
everyone is Tesla has the 
first wholly owned manufacturing facility in China for any 
-
 
of any 
automotive company. So this is profound, and we're very appreciative of the 
Chinese government allowing us to do this. I think it is symbolic of 
[indiscernible] o
pen the market. And if I 
-
 
and you know, it [indiscernible], 
so like a note of appreciation for the Chinese government in allowing us to 
do that. It's a very significant thing.
 
Gene Munster
 
Question I have is related to Waymo and the autonomous driving 
opp
ortunity. Morgan Stanley recently valued Waymo at $175 billion. And my 
question is, what do they have that you don't have? And separately 
-
 
so 
what do they have that you don't have?
 
And then separately, how important is the timing in the Tesla story longer
 
term? Is this nice to have? Is it really about EVs and renewable energy? Or 
is the autonomy kind of one of the foundational parts of the story longer 
term?
 
Elon Musk
 
[Indiscernible] goodness of Tesla, yes, so like the why of Tesla, the 
relevance, what's t
he point of Tesla, comes down to two things: acceleration 
of sustainable energy and autonomy. The acceleration of sustainable energy 
is absolutely fundamental because this is the next potential risk for 
humanity.
 
So actually, that is, by far and away, the 
most important thing. But also, 
very important is autonomy. This has the potential to save millions of lives, 
tens of millions of serious public injuries and give people their time back, so 
that they don't have to drive, they can 
-
 
if you're on the road, y
ou can spend 
time doing things that you enjoy instead of being in terrible traffic.
 
So it's extremely important. We feel confident about our technical strategy, 
and I think we have an advantage that no one else has, which is, that we 
have, at this point, s
omewhere in the order of 300,000 vehicles on the road, 
with a 360
-
degree camera sensor suite, radar, ultrasonics, always connected 
uploads, especially video clips with the customer [submission] [ph] when 
there is intervention. So effectively, we have a mas
sive, massive training 
fleet.
 
Our 
-
 
the amount of training that we have 
-
 
if you add everyone else up 
combined, they're probably 5%, I'm being generous, of the miles that Tesla 
has. And this difference is increasing. A year from now, we'll probably go 
-
 
ce
rtainly from 18 months from now, we'll probably have 1 million vehicles on 
the road with 
-
 
and every time the customers drive the car, they're training 
the systems to be better. I'm just not sure how anyone competes with that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question...
 
Martin Viecha
 
Sorry, do you have a follow
-
up question? Okay, no follow
-
up question. Okay. 
Let's go to the next participant.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
 
Colin Rusch
 
Thanks so much. Can you talk a l
ittle bit about the geographic dispersion for 
the guidance for 2019, where you're expecting the Model 3s to sell through 
as well as the other models?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I think we did, actually. Yes, it's clear in our letter.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We indicated in Q1, 
we will start delivering Model 3s in Europe and China. 
And we also shared a chart showing the potential market size for midsized 
premium sedans in North America, Europe and Asia, suggesting those 
markets could be even bigger. So I think that gives a good s
ense of where 
we'll be. And we'll launch the right
-
hand drive version at some point to go to 
the other markets.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Maybe in the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that 
this year.
 
Colin Rusch
 
Okay. And then just in terms of the
 
cost reduction road map and rework 
post
-
factory, can you talk a little bit about your expectation for reducing that 
in the next couple of quarters and what the order of magnitude is on that in 
your model internally?
 
Elon Musk
 
Jerome, do you want to answer
 
that?
 
Jerome Guillen
 
This is Jerome. Well, our manufacturing is improving quarter
-
over
-
quarter. 
Actually, week
-
over
-
week, we take fewer hours, both here in Fremont or at 
the Gigafactory, to assemble the Model 3 and S and X as well. And then we 
track 
the quality very closely.
 
We review that carefully with the engineers and the supply chain and the 
manufacturing team. And the quality in the field and the number of incidents 
is also improving week
-
over
-
week, every week. So there are fewer and 
fewer need 
for cars to be in service, yes. So we'll keep going. There's no end 
in sight. And we'll try to make sure that the car never breaks down.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I think there's like some confusion about rectification. Like I said 
-
 
like 
-
 
for us to drive the Model 
3s that come off the line, all that happens is like 
some slight adjustment of drawer gaps and panel gaps and that kind of 
thing, and that's all that's done. There's nothing more than that.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.
 
Colin 
Langan
 
Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow
-
up on the comments around 
you said about 700,000 to 800,000, you think, is the normal demand. I 
mean, any color on what price you're expecting that to be? Because I think 
there's a lot of chatter that dem
and is already weak in 
-
 
of the midrange, at 
least, already in January. I don't know if that's true as well.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean, 
-
 
there are multiple factors at play here. First of all, there's a 
lot of seasonality to automotive purchases. Most 
people do not buy a new 
car in the middle of a blizzard. So January and February tends to be 
seasonally low and then picks up significantly around the early to mid
-
March 
time frame. In the U.S., we obviously have a pull forward of demand from 
the tax credi
t.
 
And yes, there's 
-
 
so there's all those factors. But I feel very confident about 
Model 3 demand. The customer happiness level with the car is incredible and 
I think probably the highest of any car in the world right now, I think. And so 
you can tell lik
e, basically, nobody wants to sell their car.
 
Colin Langan
 
But the target price point is, I think, in the past, you mentioned mid
-
$40,000. Is that where we're thinking or a long
-
term range?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, this is really just a guess. So it's not like I got
 
some huge crystal ball or 
something. But at volume, I would expect, this is totally a guess, I want to 
be clear, probably an average of $42,000, probably at that volume level. I'm 
not certain on it.
 
Colin Langan
 
And just as a follow
-
up. You commented that
 
you expect China to be online 
by the end of the year, but there's a lot of articles that the battery supplier 
-
 
you're looking at different battery suppliers. But, I mean, do you have a 
battery supplier? Because it seems kind of close to when production i
s 
supposed to start.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, there's really three things: the cell, the module and the pack. We will 
be making the module and the pack. So it's really just a question of cell 
supply. And we can essentially use any [high density] [ph] 2170 chemistry
. 
And we expect to be a combination of cells produced at our Gigafactory in 
Nevada and cells produced in Japan and cells produced locally in China. And 
we feel confident to have a sufficient supply to hit the 3,000 units.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes f
rom Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
 
Emmanuel Rosner
 
First, I wanted to ask you about the short
-
range Model 3. What are your 
latest thoughts in terms of timing of introduction? I think at some point, you 
had in mind to do it in the 
-
 
maybe the first hal
f of this year. And just to 
clarify, when you're sort of talking about the outlook for 2019, the number 
of deliveries up 50% and then the margin target for Model 3 to get to 25%, 
does that assume that you're introducing a lower range, the short
-
range 
Model
 
3 at some point during the year?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, you could call it the standard range, but it's maybe short by Tesla's 
standards, but it's long range by other manufacturers' standards. So 
-
 
but 
yes, we expect to introduce the standard range Model 3 someti
me 
-
 
probably 
the middle of this year is a rough, rough guess. And we're working hard to 
improve our costs of production, our overhead costs, our fixed costs, just 
costs in general. I think this past year, while extremely difficult, has driven 
us to a high
 
level of financial discipline. I think we're way smarter about how 
we spend money, and we're getting better with each passing week. Yes.
 
Emmanuel Rosner
 
And so to be clear, the 
-
 
you expect to reach at some point this year 
-
 
or 
you're targeting at some po
int this year 25% gross margins on Model 3, and 
that's despite introducing the lower
-
end 
-
 
or just the standard range Model 
3. Is that correct?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Emmanuel Rosner
 
Okay. And, I guess, my follow
-
up would be on the demand side. So you're 
talking about 50% increase this year. You said a few times that it could be 
higher than this. I think you just mentioned in the previous question 
350,000 to 500,000, if I understood well. So what is sort of like what drives 
the cautious outlook that's in y
our letter? Because it feels like it's the 
-
 
it's 
just basically four times the fourth quarter run rate, which would imply sort 
of 50% for the full year but not really a lot of growth versus what you just 
accomplished. So, I guess, how do we think about th
e total demand for 
2019, especially if you introduced this 
-
 
the cheaper version?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we need to bring the Shanghai factory online. I think that's the biggest 
driver for getting to 500K plus a year. Our car is just very expensive going 
into Chi
na. We've got import duties. We've got transport costs. We've got 
higher
-
cost labor here. And we've never been eligible for any of the EV tax 
credits. A lot of people sort of dependent on incentives. In fact, we are 
[indiscernible] EVs, we have the least a
ccess to incentives. It's pretty crazy 
because there's so many companies that 
-
 
countries that have put price caps 
on the EV incentive, which affects Tesla. And in China, which is the biggest 
market for EVs, we've never had any subsidies or tax incentives 
for vehicles.
 
So it's 
-
 
it is eligible for that. But it sounds like that's going to be reducing in 
China in the coming years. But, really, bottom line is, we need the Shanghai 
factory to achieve that 10k rate and other cars be affordable.
 
The demand for 
-
 
the demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is 
affordability. It's just like people literally don't have the money to buy the 
car. It's got nothing to do with desire. They just don't have enough money in 
their bank account. If the car can be mad
e more affordable, the demand is 
extraordinary.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
So, Deepak, I was wondering, so as you get to 2019, we're all concerned 
about the potential recession, and I was w
ondering how you think about it 
and what you would tell us about what we should expect 
-
 
how we should 
expect Tesla to react to recession in 2019. How do you manage your volume 
land? How do you manage your pricing? How do you present cash? How do 
you manag
e your CapEx if things turn south in 2019? And then I have a 
follow
-
up on gross margin for Jerome.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, it's a very broad question, which is not really just for me to answer. But 
I think at the highest level, the way we are trying to be prepar
ed for any 
kind of contingency here is to just continue focusing on cost. And the theme 
of our conversations here is, how do we reduce cost all the time? And how 
do we run our business with a very high level of financial discipline? And 
Elon alluded to tha
t and so did Jerome 
-
 
Jerome, I think. That 
-
 
if we do 
that, we believe that even in some of the scenarios of lower volumes and 
pricing 
-
 
tight pricing, we do have a good chance and a good shot of being 
profitable and generate free cash flow. So that's the
 
best way to manage the 
business, be frugal.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, I don't want to be a broken record about this, it's costs, costs, costs, 
because reducing our costs 
-
 
by the way, while making improvements to 
Model 3, I want to emphasize, the product is getting 
better by slight degrees 
despite lower costs in hundreds of small ways. But you actually wouldn't 
notice explicitly, but they would appreciate subconsciously. And getting 
those costs down, variable costs and fixed costs, is what allows us to lower 
the pric
e and be financially sustainable and achieve our mission of 
environmental sustainability. So we have to be absolute clear about this. 
There's no question.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
The other aspect of this, Elon, which we've been doing extremely well, is 
capital effici
ency. We have dramatically cut back on capital expense, and we 
are spending it in a very efficient manner. We talked about it in the letter on 
Model 3 and Gigafactory Shanghai. We talked about it for Model Y. There are 
just so many learnings that we are in
corporating, and we just want to beat 
what we did with Model 3 and the kind of spending we had for the returns 
we got.
 
Elon Musk
 
Absolutely. I mean, we're confident that our CapEx per unit of production for 
Shanghai factory and for Model Y will be less tha
n half of what we did for 
Model 3. Internally, we think it might be a quarter but that's probably too 
good to believe, but it's definitely less than half.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.
 
David Tamberrino
 
First thi
ng I want to just understand is on what you're seeing from European 
orders and China orders so far. There are some numbers that get thrown 
around, but you guys are obviously taking a look at it. How is that order 
profile shaping up relative to what you saw
 
in the U.S. with the launch of the 
3?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think it seems good. I mean, our share actually with Europe and China is, 
how do we get the cars made and on a boat as such that it reaches 
customers before end of quarter and we don't have a massive numbe
r of 
cars on the water. That's our biggest challenge. It's not demand. It's how do 
we get the cars there fast enough.
 
David Tamberrino
 
So like orders above, I think I've seen like 20,000 order levels for Europe 
and single
-
digit thousands for China is bette
r than that, Elon?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, absolutely. The 
-
 
I mean, we're not even really trying, I should point 
out. I guess it's 
-
 
we 
-
 
our factory is like, right now, only making cars for 
China and Europe. That's all it's doing for 
-
 
with respect to Model 3. 
And our 
whole focus is, okay, how do we get those cars made, get them on a ship as 
fast as possible, get the ship as fast as possible to Zeebrugge in Belgium 
then get them over to Drammen in Norway and get those cars to customers 
as fast as possible. We ge
t them to China as fast as possible.
 
In China, we were also 
-
 
yes, we don't what's going to happen with the trade 
negotiations. So that's very important to get those cars especially to China 
as soon as possible. We hope the trade negotiations go well, but 
it's not 
clear. But we need to get them there while there's sort of a de facto 
-
 
sort of 
a truce on the tariff war. And the demand gen is really not one of the things 
we're thinking about.
 
David Tamberrino
 
Okay. Then just lastly on this demand thread, cust
omer deposit came in 
again over $100 million. Is it possible to give us an update? I know you 
don't think it's really a relevant number but I do want to know. Explain why 
on the reservation count, where you were 450,000, you started delivering. 
And I ask t
his because I think we're just all trying to understand how much 
incremental demand you think there is based on what you see at that lower 
price point if, say, there's over half of those people that are still waiting for 
that 75k base model to come out. Th
at would be interesting, and I think 
that's what you're seeing but I just want to confirm that.
 
Elon Musk
 
So Deepak, do you want to...
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, I mean, I think reservations are not relevant for us. We are really 
focused on orders. Now we do have a
 
large reservations backlog still, which 
tells us that a lot of customers are still waiting for those cars, but I don't 
think it's appropriate to share the reservations number.
 
Elon Musk
 
Reservations are just like preorders. It's like here 
-
 
like some vide
o game 
come out and there's like a preorder number, then that's like 
-
 
stops being 
important once you start shipping the game or product. So yes, as I said 
earlier, I think 
-
 
my guess is demand is somewhere on the order 
-
 
in a 
strong economy is on the orde
r of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year for Model 
3 and even in a recession is probably on the order of 0.5 million.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities.
 
Daniel Ives
 
So my question is around Europe. Obviously, with delive
ries coming onboard 
in the first quarter, maybe what surprised you in terms of 
-
 
your demand 
looks strong, but in terms of what you're seeing at the region, is it stronger 
than you expected in certain countries? What do you think is driving that? 
And maybe
 
you can just talk about the opportunities and challenges in 
Europe especially from a delivery logistics perspective.
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, like I said, we're thinking about demand almost zero right now. It's 
really getting the product there in time and not havi
ng a ton of cars on the 
water and in a quarter and then for China getting cars there before there's a 
potential rise in tariffs. That's really 
-
 
put really at front of mind that cost 
reduction and then improving service in North America, yes.
 
Daniel Ives
 
A
nd just maybe a quick follow
-
up on 
-
 
can you just talk about 
-
 
when we 
look at the Gigafactory build
-
out in China and obviously how important that 
is, can you maybe just fast forward, let's say, 18, 24 months? I mean, how 
do you envision that as just a com
petitive advantage versus maybe some 
other automakers that will be trying to go in your tracks?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think it will be quite a significant advantage, a really good 
-
 
it's quite 
fundamental to the future of Tesla, and I expect to make several trips to
 
China this year. And I'm working very closely with the team building the 
factory. I literally get daily updates. So it's a super big deal and we're only 
just talking about Phase 1 here. Phase 1 is about 10% of what we think the 
Gigafactory will ultimately
 
be. So it's a major, major, major deal. And we're 
getting a lot of support from the Shanghai government, which we're very 
appreciative of, and the national government.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Y
ou've talked repeatedly about the need to drive down costs, which, in turn, 
drives the elasticity of demand for cars. And I'm wondering if you can talk 
about how much of a price differential between the $50,000 Model 3 and the 
$35,000 Model 3 is structural
, meaning that powertrain costs for EVs are 
just structurally higher than they are for internal combustion engine cars. 
And where do you think that difference is today and when that is no longer a 
factor? So is 
-
 
or maybe said another way, is the bigger dr
iver in getting to 
lower costs and lower 
-
 
and more affordability on the Model 3, is it really 
around the powertrain and getting that at parity? Or is it everything else 
about Tesla not being as efficient as other manufacturers that is causing the 
higher p
rice right now? And have I follow
-
up, please.
 
Jerome Guillen
 
It's both, it's both, the vehicle and both the powertrain. So I split my time 
half and half between the Gigafactory and here, and there is opportunities in 
both, yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
But I think the
 
bigger point is that, yes, there is cost reduction opportunities 
out, but the bigger point is it's not that our cost is higher than a gas
-
powered or an internal combustion engine.
 
Martin Viecha
 
I think what Toni meant is with the battery pack, as in 
battery pack as well 
as the powertrain together, are more expensive than an engine.
 
Elon Musk
 
That's true.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
And how big do you think that delta is today? And when it's 
-
 
do you think of 
it as being kind of $10,000, $11,000 for that pack plus
 
powertrain for an 
electric vehicle and maybe $5,000 or $6,000 for an internal combustion 
engine car? And is that sort of the order of magnitude? And where do you 
see those getting much more aligned just sort of given the lives of where 
you think cell and 
pack costs are going?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, the biggest part to bear in mind is because of electricity, it's quite a bit 
less than the cost of gasoline, especially in Europe or in California or China, 
basically almost everywhere except, say, the middle of the 
United States, 
where the cost of gasoline is very expensive and electricity is far cheaper. 
The 
-
 
so that factors in to the cost of ownership pretty significantly. It's on 
-
 
sort of going on the order of $50 to $100 a month depending upon how 
much somebody
 
drives. So that's a very important thing to consider for an 
electric car versus a gasoline car. The 
-
 
that said, in terms of initial cost of 
acquisition, I think it's probably 
-
 
this is just off the top of my head, not a 
calculated number, probably on the
 
order of 7k but trending towards 4k or 
5k. It's off the top of my head.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Okay. And as you think about 2019, you talked about sort of scenarios for 
demand and how you plan to roll out the intermediate range and then 
ultimately the standard r
ange. What is 
-
 
if you do have to make a trade
-
off 
on volume or profitability during the course of the year, meaning to get the 
volume you need or you think you can deliver, you have to go to lower 
margins or vice versa, where's the trade
-
off? Is 
-
 
are uni
ts produced most 
important to you? Or is delivering the 25% gross margin more important? 
So if you have a chance to deliver 450,000 or 500,000 cars but they'll be 
more standard editions and gross margins will end the year at 20%, is that 
-
 
are you willing 
to make that trade
-
off?
 
Elon Musk
 
My guess is it ends up being sort of about the 6.5 [does together] where if 
there's a given amount of free cash flow, you sort of decide 
-
 
you decide to 
achieve that with a smaller production or smaller volume of cars or a
t a 
higher margin or large volume cars at a smaller margin. I think we're 
already towards the second. We're going to make more cars at a lower 
margin, but I think it's more or less a flat rate.

Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquari
e.
 
Maynard Um
 
Can you just update us on where battery costs are now and where you 
anticipate they'll be by year
-
end? I'm just trying to gauge how much of a 
factor this is to lowering costs and sustaining profitability.
 
Elon Musk
 
That's a highly proprietary
 
number. We cannot give it out, but I'd like to tell 
you but no. We do think we have the best costs in the world. We're 
-
 
to the 
best of our knowledge, our costs are lower than anyone else right now and 
they're improving.
 
Maynard Um
 
And maybe talk about yo
ur expectations with the Panasonic
-
Toyota JV and 
how it might impact you. Was this something that you were made aware of?
 
Elon Musk
 
I spoke directly with Tsuga
-
san about this, the Head of Panasonic, and he 
assured me this will have no impact on Tesla.

Our next question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.
 
Dan Galves
 
Do you plan to offer a U.S. lease product for Model 3 in the U.S.? When can 
we expect it? And can you talk about what percentage of S and X have 
historically been leased in the U.
S.?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we've been reluctant to introduce the leasing on Model 3 because of 
how 
-
 
of its effect on GAAP financials. So it is worth noting that demand to 
date is with zero leasing. So obviously, leasing is a way to improve demand 
but it has 
-
 
it
 
makes our financials looks worse. So we're 
-
 
we don't want to 
introduce that right away. I mean, we'll introduce it sometime later this year 
probably. What 
-
 
I'm not sure the percentage of lease is for S and X right 
now.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
It's around 20%, 
low 20s, and it stayed stable at that level for many, many 
quarters, which is 
-
 
it seems like the natural demand because we don't do 
[some invention or] artificially bump up.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, exactly. Our leases are legit. The 
-
 
it usually expects a small bu
siness. 
Tax write
-
off is important for the 
-
 
for leasing. So...
 
Dan Galves
 
Okay. And then I have just, like, two quick housekeeping questions. One, is 
there a restructuring charge that you expect in the first quarter? How much 
is it? And is it included in 
your expectation of a small profit?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, it is included in that. It's difficult to say exactly what that is. At this 
point, it's, let's say, roughly around $40 million, but that number can vary 
slightly.
 
Dan Galves
 
Okay. And then just the last
 
one is...
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sorry, go ahead.
 
Dan Galves
 
Yes, the last one is, this change in your service parts structure to make 
things more distributed rather than in the parts warehouse is, would that be 
like a meaningful working capital drag? What's the ca
sh impact of that?
 
Elon Musk
 
No, it's actually 
-
 
we've just been very silly about where we store our parts. 
So it's actually going to be no change in sort of working capital or not 
something you would even notice in the financials. It's just being smarter 
about sending parts directly to service centers, in fact either directly from 
our factory here or from our suppliers and just ship and direct to the service 
center. Right now, actually, our costs will improve, I think, actually quite a 
lot, persistent, act
ually quite 
-
 
they're kind of persistent. It's quite 
boneheaded, actually speaking self
-
referentially. So just being 
-
 
so stopping 
doing the foolish things will massively improve our service costs, will 
massively improve customer happiness around the world
, and it's just 
fundamentally better all around. I mean, there are some pretty 
-
 
we've been 
just like super dumb in some of the things we've done, where 
-
 
like [I went] 
to China last year as I always asked, ""Okay, what are we doing wrong? What 
can we fix?""
 
And then like our China team is great always. They're like, 
""Well, do you think we could have spare parts that are made in China just 
sent directly to China service centers? Because currently, there's a bunch of 
parts that are made in China then sent to a
 
warehouse in New Jersey and 
then sent back to China."" Literally, what was happening? It's super [dumb 
stuff]. So it's going to get way better. And yes, it's very queer.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.
 
Ben Kallo
 
I have one quest
ion and it's got four parts to it. Happy new year, Elon. So 
the first part is 
-
 
so our Street numbers, like consensus, we've got 
everything wrong for six years or seven years since you went public, and 
there are about $6 in earnings. Talk to us about that 
if you can. Number 
two, Elon, could you talk to us about 
-
 
can you talk about 
-
 
I hear you cut 
some workforce at SpaceX and there at Tesla. I feel that you have a worry 
about global economy. Can you talk to us about how you feel about that 
with your guidan
ce in order 
-
 
in the same order? And then can we talk 
about, maybe sort of third thing, for JV? No one's ever going to talk about 
stationary storage, but we had a whole page on that with pretty good 
speech, and what should we be focusing on that? And what 
can that add to 
the bottom line on top of that $6 this next year?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I mean, we can't really, Ben, talk about consensus and what that means. I 
think the 
-
 
maybe the better approach is we are providing certain guidance 
here and you and the other a
nalysts need to reflect that in your modeling. 
And that's the best indication from the company of our projections. In all 
fairness, that's the best way I can think of answering your question here.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. J.B., is there anything...
 
Jeffrey Straubel
 
I mean, I think the letter outlines the predicted growth in the battery 
storage business, the stationary storage business pretty clearly, and that 
should be included in the projections as well. So I mean, we're excited about 
it but I can't say much more de
tail.
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean, our internal projections for stationary storage are closer to 3 
gigawatt hours. But some of it is kind of lumpy and may not be completed 
this year. We would have done more in stationary storage last year except 
we were so strong for
 
vehicle production. So we had to convert a bunch of 
stationary storage lines, battery lines, to vehicle battery lines. Otherwise, we 
would have done quite a bit more in stationary storage. I expect that to 
grow, I mean, probably twice as fast as automotiv
e for short 
-
 
a long time.
 
Jeffrey Straubel
 
We continue to set production records basically every month. So that's 
growing.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And the profitability of the storage business and the gross margin continue 
to improve as we keep ramping up 
production and scale.
 
Elon Musk
 
It's going to be a gigantic business down the road.
 
Martin Viecha
 
And the last question was about economy, global economy.
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure. I mean, I do think that the economy moves in cycles and there's fairly 
a significant 
risk of a recession over the next 12 to 18 months, but I'm 
confident that Tesla will remain at least slightly profitable even with 
-
 
even if 
there is a significant recession. And then when 
-
 
and be all the stronger for it 
when there's recession. And the 
-
 
we have to be relentless about cost in 
order to make affordable cars and not go back up. That's what our 
headcount reduction is about, yes, yes. I think we have to 
-
 
it's 
-
 
we have to 
be super hardcore about it. It's the only way to make affordable cars. T
he 
-
 
on the SpaceX side, the cost reduction was for a different reason unrelated 
to 
-
 
SpaceX has really 
-
 
SpaceX has two absolutely insane projects that 
would normally bankrupt a company, Starship and Starlink, and so SpaceX 
has to be incredibly spartan wi
th expenditures until those programs reach 
fruition.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay, Great. I think that's all we have time for today. Thank you very much 
for your questions, and Elon would like to have some closing remarks.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So let's see. The 
-
 
so Deepa
k is 
-
 
well, I'd like you to make the 
announcement, but Deepak is going to be retiring.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Again.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, from Tesla.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Deepak, I think it's now been 
-
 
you first started with Tesla about 11 years 
ago, right?
 
Deepa
k Ahuja
 
When 
-
 
close to that, yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, almost 11 years. Thank you for your tremendous contribution to Tesla. 
And he's announcing retirement but the retirement will not be immediate, 
but Deepak will continue to be at Tesla for a few more months a
nd will 
continue to serve as a senior adviser to Tesla for probably years to come 
hopefully. And we thought long and hard about who the right person is to 
take over from Deepak, and that's Zach. And Zach has been with Tesla now 
for nine years...
 
Martin Vie
cha
 
Nine years.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So Zach [ph] you had management and technology at Wharton 
undergrad and then worked at Tesla and then spent a couple of years at 
Harvard Business School, which I actually don't think was necessary, by the 
way.
 
Martin 
Viecha
 
You told me that when I came back.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, exactly. So Zach's incredibly talented, has made a huge contribution to 
Tesla over the years, and obviously a very well
-
known [quantity] to the 
whole team and has the respect of the whole team. And Z
ach, I don't know 
if you'd like to say a few words?
 
Martin Viecha
 
Yes, I will.
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay. Or do you want, Deepak, to save you?
 
Martin Viecha
 
Deepak?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sure, okay. Thank you, yes. Well, first of all, Elon, thank you very much for 
the opportu
nity for me to be here and be here again a second time. I've 
learned a lot from you and I've been always inspired by you, and I've been 
also very inspired by the team at Tesla who are incredibly brilliant, very 
passionate and just amazingly perseverant, th
e best team I could imagine. 
So thank you everybody for that. There is no good time to make this 
change. We felt strongly this was a good time. It's a new chapter, a new 
year. Tesla has had two great quarters of profitability, cash flow, so now a 
really so
lid foundation. And I feel really good about Zach taking over as the 
CFO. He's proven himself with his many years of experience and many tough 
challenges that he's worked on and really excited to have Zach take on this 
role, and I'll be here to support him
 
and make sure we are all successful as a 
company.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Yes, well, thank you, Deepak. Thank you, Elon. So my name is Zach 
Kirkhorn. Just a brief background on myself. So I joined Tesla just under 
nine years ago when it's a super small company with
 
a lot of potential ahead 
of us and I was attracted to the mission and the vision of the company. 
Throughout that time, I've been deep in the operations of every major 
program of the company, from the Roadster to Model S and X, Model 3, 
scaling our Energy 
business and more things to come, which we've talked 
about on the call. I feel we're starting 2019 with a very strong financial 
foundation. We have enough cash to continue launching new programs and 
developing new technologies, and we're able to service up
coming debt 
obligations with our forecasted cash flows. My focus alongside the talented 
and amazingly passionate team at Tesla is to ensure we continue the terrific 
momentum on cost management and operational efficiency, which will 
enable us more 
-
 
enable 
more access to our products around the world, 
which is key to achieving the mission of the company. On a personal note, 
Deepak, a huge thank you to you for your leadership, mentorship and 
support and very much looking forward to discussing our progress on 
future 
earnings calls.

7/26/12,Tesla,"All right. Thank you. I think the most important point here that we want to 
make is that we're advancing the Model 3 build plan substantially, and just 
the overall volume plan, with Tesla aiming to get to the half million unit per 
year run rate in 
2018 instead of 2020. And this is based off of the 
tremendous [amount of interest] received for the Model 3, which I think is 
actually a fraction of the ultimate demand once people fully understand what 
the car's capable of and are able to do a test drive.
 
So this is probably the biggest change strategically. Also, Tesla is going to 
be hell
-
bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. Thus far, I think 
we've done a good job on design and technology of our products. The Model 
S and X I think are generall
y regarded by very critical judges as 
technologically the most advanced cars in the world. And so I think they've 
done well in that respect.
 
The key thing we need to achieve in the future is to also be the leader in 
manufacturing. We take manufacturing ver
y seriously at Tesla. It's the thing 
that we need to obviously solve if we're going to scale and scale rapidly and 
make the cars more affordable. So I really want to sort of send the message 
out there to the best manufacturing people in the world, we want 
you to 
come join our company. And that is going to be the primary focus of Tesla, 
is how do we get super
-
good at making large, complex objects? So that's I 
think the most salient point. It's easy to get wrapped up in like a bunch of 
sort of short
-
term issu
es, but I think in terms of what matters for the future, 
I think that's the most significant thing.
 
Overall, on the short
-
term stuff, our quarter
-
over
-
quarter stuff I think has 
improved quite significantly. I've seen Model X production increase by a 
factor
 
of five from Q4 to Q1, and we continue to make huge strides in 
volume and quality of the vehicle. And I'm personally spending an enormous 
amount of time on the production line. My desk is at the end of the 
production line. I have a sleeping bag in a confe
rence room adjacent to the 
production line, which I use quite frequently. The whole team is super
-
focused on achieving rate and quality at the target cost. So I felt very 
confident in us achieving that goal.
 
And with the increase in ramp, we do feel comfor
table affirming the 89,000 
deliveries this year. So, I think the rate of improvement with each passing 
day is very significant. I'd like to sort of thank Greg Reichow, who was our 
head of production for tremendous contribution over the last five years. 
Con
trary to some media reports, Greg is still at Tesla. He is still with the 
company, and he is helping with the transition to some new leadership. And 
we have some I think exciting announcements coming in the next, possibly 
the next few weeks about additions
 
to the Tesla management team on the 
production side. So I'm feeling really, really excited about where things are 
headed in that direction.
 
All right. With that, let's go to questions.

Thank you. Our first 
question comes from James Albertine of Stifel.
 
James J. Albertine, Jr.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Great. Thank you so much question. And, Elon, thank you for that 
introduction. There's no doubt you have an incredible undertaking in front of 
you. Can yo
u help us understand some of the key obstacles and how we 
should consider those obstacles between now and your anticipated launch of 
the Model 3 in late 2017? Whether it's sort of P&L adjustments that we need 
to make along the way? But can you just help us
 
sort of choreograph how 
that's going to take place?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. So with the Model 3, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we're 
really trying to take a lot of lessons learned from Model X, where Model X,
 
we put a lot of bells and whistles on Model X and a lot of advanced 
technologies that weren't necessary for version one of the vehicle. And with 
Model 3 we're being incredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have 
anything that isn't really necessary
 
to make a very compelling version one of 
the car. We also have a much tighter feedback loop between design 
engineering, manufacturing engineering, and production.
 
And so no element of Model 3 can be approved unless manufacturing has 
said that this is easy
 
to manufacture and that the risk associated with 
manufacturing it is low. There are many ways to skin a cat, and it's 
remarkable how you can achieve a single objective with a hugely varying 
degree of difficulty. You can sort of take the analogy and say, i
f you wanted 
to kill a fly, you can kill a fly with a thermonuclear weapon, you can with a 
Moab, with a cruise missile, with a machine gun, or a fly swatter. So the end 
result is the same, but the difficulty is considerably more significant from 
one to the
 
other and the collateral damage is considerably more significant. 
So having production be really fundamental to the design of the Model 3 I 
think is very important and then making sure we're not adding extraneous 
features to the 3 that aren't necessary to
 
achieve the production volume is 
also extremely important.
 
At the risk of this being misinterpreted, and probably there will be some 
number of articles that do, I think it's worth explaining sort of how 
manufacturing a complex object with several thousand
 
unique components 
actually works. And what date's relevant and 

 
in order to achieve volume 
production of a new car with several thousand unique items, you actually 
have to set a target date internally and with suppliers that is quite 
aggressive. And that
 
is a date that has to be taken seriously. So like the 
date, because I'm sure this will leak it's hard to keep a secret, really. The 
date we are setting with suppliers to get to a volume production capability 
with the Model 3 is July 1 next year.
 
Now, will
 
we actually be able to achieve volume production on July 1 next 
year? Of course, not. The reason is that even if 99% of the internally 
produced items and supplier items are available on July 1, we still cannot 
produce the car because you cannot produce a 
car that is missing 1% of its 
component. Nonetheless, we need to both internally and with suppliers take 
that date seriously, and there needs to be some penalties for anyone 
internally or externally who does not meet that timeframe. This has to be 
the case
, because there's just no way that you have several thousand 
components, all of whom make it on a particular date.
 
So the reality is that the volume production will then be some number of 
months later as we solve the supply chain and internal production is
sues. 
But it is a bit of a confusing thing, and it does create some churn, because 
people are like, well, what's the real date? It's like, you have to take the July 
1 date seriously in order for some date a few months later or some number 
of months later t
o actually be the real date. So, yeah, that's actually how it 
has to work. So in order for us to be confident of achieving volume 
production of Model 3 by late 2017, we actually have to set a date of mid
-
2017 and really hold people's feet to the fire inter
nally and externally to 
achieve an actual volume production date of late 2017.
 
So as a rough guess, I would say we would aim to produce 100,000 to 
200,000 Model 3s in the second half of next year. That's my expectation 
right now. Yeah, so that's the thing.
 
Now what I would say to anyone that is thinking about ordering a Model 3, 
now is a good time to actually place your reservation or place the order, 
because you don't have to worry about placing your order and receiving it 
five years from now. If you place
 
your order now, there's a high probability 
you will actually receive your car in 2018. So I'd really recommend that 
anyone who wants to receive their car in 2018 place their order very soon.
 
James J. Albertine, Jr.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Elon, tha
nk you. And if I may as a follow up, can you give us some reference 
as to 

 
again, most generously you would think if you said fourth quarter of 
2017, so six months at its most generous calculation, how did that compare 
with the volume production agreed da
te for the Model X just as an example? 
And then how did this flow with your cash needs as you've articulated? It 
seems you've walked back a little bit from the prior quarter's discussion 
around cash flow, positive and no need for Capital Market's raise. It
 
seems 
like there may be a need here, but if you could just articulate how the two fit 
together, that'd be helpful, thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
It's always tempting for people to reason by analogy instead of first 
principle
s. And that would be the mistake of assuming that anything to do 
with the X production has bearing on Model 3. They are very different 
programs with completely different approaches. So I would not try to 
extrapolate from that any more than it would've made
 
sense to extrapolate 
from the Roadster that when we were making 600 cars a year to 20,000 
cars a year with the Model S. So in the Roadster case we went from making 
600 cars a year in 2010 where Lotus made the body and chassis, we made 
the powertrain and w
e did final assembly. It was a far simpler car than the 
Model S. We tell people we're going to do 20,000, get to around 20,000 cars 
a year with the Model S despite it being a vastly more complicated car and a 
car where we made the whole car and not just th
e powertrain.
 
If you were to extrapolate from the Roadster experience, you would be 
completely wrong about the Model S outcome, and many people were. 
That's why I would say X is not relevant. As far as the increased capital 
raise, well, obviously if you do
uble your plan volume, you can't expect the 
capital to stay the same. I think our capital efficiency will actually improve 
on a per
-
car basis, but obviously it can't stay the same.

Our next question comes from Colin Langan of UBS.
 
Colin Michael Langan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Oh, great. Thanks for taking my 
question. Just a kind of follow up, you've 
had issues with the X. There's management changes. What gives you the 
confidence that the 500,000 

 
that's a pretty amazing jump into next year? 
What kind of gives that conviction that that's going to be possible 
by 2020?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
You mean by 2018?
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Yeah, 2018. Yeah.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, well, first of all, I think we've got an excellent team a
t Tesla in 
production, and we're adding world
-
class aces in production with each 
passing week. It is a huge advantage to have the most 

 
I mean, I think it's 
fair to say it's probably the most compelling product program in the world 
with the Model 3. I'm n
ot sure what would be more compelling. I think 
there's a good argument that Model 3 is the most compelling program on 
earth from a manufacturing standpoint.
 
So our ability to recruit top manufacturing talent to the most compelling 
product on earth is very 
strong. We find the response to be extremely good 
when we call people up. So based on the rate at which we're adding world
-
class manufacturing expertise and some of the things that I know we're 
going to announce in the future, I feel highly confident that 
the Model 3 is 
going to be well executed as a program and 

 
yes, you want to add 
something, J.B.?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah, if I might just add, I mean, you mentioned this briefly before, but the 
design of the vehicle lends itsel
f to high
-
volume production very efficiently. 
And I think...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel

Chief Technology Officer
 
That's really...
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Designed for manufa
cturing.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Absolutely. And that's something that we're doing even today. Those designs 
are firming up. So this is something happening far, far ahead of time. And 
the second point would be the quality and the mot
ivation of the suppliers 
involved in the program is...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Best ever.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Massively increased. Yeah. I 
mean, every supplier wants to be in this 
program.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Got it. And if I could just ask a follow
-
up. I mean, obviously cost is going to 
be an important factor when 3 launches. I think you've indicated that your 
battery c
ost with PACCAR now under $190 per kilowatt hour. How do you 
think that compares to the industry? Where do you think it'll be by the time 
the Model 3 is launching, since that launch is being pulled forward?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Offi
cer
 
Yeah. We're trying to comment on individual component costs, and that's 
fairly proprietary. It's kind of like giving away our playbook. But I think it's 
pretty obvious that we will exceed anyone else in the world in scale 
economies with the Gigafactory
, and we're very confident in Panasonic's 
ability to execute on that front. So I just don't know anyone who in terms of 
intrinsic cost is going to be close to what the Gigafactory can produce on a 
cost per kilowatt hour basis.

And any color when you think about the $190 per kilowatt hour, how much 
like a CAGR of decline until the Gigafactory is open, another 30% once that's 
on line?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.
 
Colin Rusch

Oppenheimer
 
& Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Thanks so much. As you look at this accelerated plan for production, what 
can we expect on OpEx spending to support all of those cars coming out a 
lot faster than you previously expected?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, 
this is Jason. I think when we updated our guidance on OpEx for the 
year a little bit in the letter, we talked about 20% last year and moving that 
range to 20% to 25% for 2016, so there's obviously going to need to be 
more OpEx at this. However, at the sam
e time, you see how we improved 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter in terms of OpEx. We were down $12 million from Q4, 
down 3%, so there's a renewed focus in the halls here at Tesla. I'm making 
sure that we are managing costs extremely effectively. And all of our 
employ
ees get that and are contributing to that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, I mean, I think our sort of operating leverage means sort of fixed cost 
relative to our variable cost is going to improve dramatically as you get 
volume u
p.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, absolutely. We talked a little bit about this on the call last quarter. The 
potential for operating leverage is massive with production scaling.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Great. And then
, Elon, what do you need to see to move your desk out of 
the factory? It's kind of a dramatic thing to talk about having your factory in 
your sleeping bag there, so obviously there are some things you're 
concerned about but what are you going to want to se
e to go back to a 
different location?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I mean, my desk has frequently been in the factory. This is not some 
new thing. On the Model S ramp, my desk was also in the middle of the 
factory at the start
 
of the body line for a year. So I move my desk around to 
wherever the most important place is for the company. And then I sort of 
maintain a desk there over time to sort of come and check in on things. But 
I mean, I suspect probably by the end of this qua
rter, most of my time will 
not be spent on the factory floor.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pat Archambault of Goldman 
Sachs.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
All right. Thank you. Good afternoon. So getting back to the 
capital 
requirement for the expanded Model 3 production, I appreciate the guidance 
that you've provided for this year from a CapEx perspective, that's helpful. 
But, I don't know, maybe this is a question for Jason. I mean, have you guys 

 
can you share wit
h us maybe what a total capital cost estimate might look 
like for the Model 3 program now that you've got a handle on what your 
volume is going to be or what you want to produce to?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, a couple of things there. So
, one, we provided some bread crumbs, 
like we updated our CapEx guidance to 

 
we had guided at $1.5 billion last 
quarter and we think it'll probably be 50% higher than that for 2016 into 
2017.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
1.5?.
 
Jason 
Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
What?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
1.5?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
1.5. And into 2017 we're not going to talk about that right now. But the 
other thing to pay attention to is our CapEx for th
is quarter was $216 
million, which was a 47% decrease over Q4. A little bit of that is what we 
talked about last quarter were a lot of the big investments for Model X had 
already been made, but also we're just really focusing, as Elon has said, on 
capital 
efficiency and making sure that we are investing in the highest and 
best uses of cash. And I think those principles are what's going to guide the 
Model 3 program.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Yeah. I mean, look, that's a good starting point to
 
work with for us. I mean, 
we appreciate the update for this year. Maybe the way to take the question 
is just to kind of understand when the peak spending periods are going to 
be. If you're launching through middle of next year, is it kind of a good idea 
t
o maybe extend the amount of capital you see spending kind of in the 
balance of three quarters through the second half of next year? And then, 
clearly with the launch, that tapers off. Is that a right way to think about it? 
And then second to that, I would
 
probably ask the same question, just on 
the R&D front. When do those costs spike in the timeframe of that program?
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. I think you are thinking about it the right way, the way you've laid it 
out, and you can kind 
of use Model X and Model S and the ramp of capital 
for those programs as a way to think about Model 3.
 
On the R&D piece of it, that is a big driver behind our updating of our range 
to 20% to 25% OpEx in 2016. So we'll start to see a little bit of that in t
he 
second half of this year, and then certainly some more into the first half of 
2017.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Got it. If I can squeeze in one last one, just on the sourcing. Is this changing 
your strategy of working with suppliers? I mea
n, you have done a lot in
-
house for all your products so far, but obviously this is a very different kind 
of volume number you're talking about. So are you thinking about changing 
the level of vertical integration, and how does that work into sort of an 
on
going capital requirements for this program?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
No, I think we are actually going to increase the amount of vertical 
integration that we have. I think it's very important for us to have the ability 
to produ
ce almost any part on the car at will because it alleviates risk with 
suppliers going back to like where if 2% of supplies is not ready we can't 
make the car. Having the ability internally to adapt and make that 2% of 
parts internally it really massively r
educes risks associated with the 
production ramp. That, I think, is a very important thing.
 
Now once, like if we get to steady state, and maybe we talk to a supplier 
and they can do a very efficient job of making that part, we have no problem 
transitioning
 
it from in
-
source to outsource. Our goal is not to in
-
source for 
the sake of in
-
sourcing, but rather to in
-
source if we think that it has 
meaningful improvement on schedule, or cost or quality. And, I mean, one 
of the challenges we face is that for a lot 
of supply chains, they are 
impedance
-
matched to the timeframe of the big OEMs, and Tesla just moves 
a lot faster than the big OEMs. And so if the impedance matched to a typical 
sort of like a six
-
year development cycle, and we are on a two or three
-
year 
de
velopment cycle, it just doesn't connect properly. Some suppliers can 
handle that and some can't.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Certainly seems to limit some of the people you could work with. Thanks for 
the clarification.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. O
ur next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes. Good evening 

 
afternoon. I just want to talk a little bit about maybe 
some of the milestones that you see, in terms of this accelerated 
development and launch of the scale up of the Model 3. First, it looked like in 
the proxy that the alpha prototype was completed as of when it was filed a 
few weeks ago. So a few questions. One, when do you kind of expect the 
beta prototype to be achieved?
 
When do you think you will have firm specs 
for both your internal parts operations and for your external suppliers? And 
then in terms of the capital, do you see 

 
two other questions kind of 

 
when would you see raising capital, if at all, to meet this? A
nd then, finally, 
given the volume of trade
-
off decisions you're talking about making between 
manufacturing, design, engineering, do you see any role for a COO type 
similar to what you have at SpaceX to accomplish this timeline?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman 
& Chief Executive Officer
 
Okay. That's like 17 questions in just one.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
You can send us the project plan.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, from an engineering standpoint, we are already almo
st complete with 
the design of Model 3. And in fact, the prototype that was driving at the 
[Motor Event] at the end of March was actually using the production 
drivetrain. So I think we feel pretty good about engineering completion of 
the last items probabl
y within six to eight weeks, thereabouts. And so we're 
sort of completing the final release for tooling no later than the end of June. 
That sort of leaves roughly nine months for the tools you manufacture, 
which I think is an achievable timeframe. [Get] so
me suppliers, but it's an 
achievable timeframe. If you can have 

 
you can create a human baby in 
nine months, you can pretty much make a tool in nine months. So that's our 
expectation. So then we want to have parts of production tooling starting in 
April n
ext year. Still we've got three months of validation for a normal start 
of volume production in July.
 
Again, it's a nominal start, and it's a date that we internally take seriously 
and that suppliers need to take seriously. But it is one where inevitably t
here 
will be some small number of items that cause slippage such that the actual 
date of reaching volume production is some number of months after that. 
This is simply in the nature of things. It's unavoidable. And so that's 

 
and if 
you could tell me what
 
those parts would be, we would be able to take 
action now.
 
It's easiest what these things are in hindsight but not in advance. And 
sometimes there are things you don't expect to be a problem. So Tesla is a 
large, complex business. I don't want to comment 
on too specifically on 
Senior Exec hires.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. And, I guess, does this imply similar accelerated schedule for the 
Gigafactory, which always seemed tied to the 2020 0.5 million unit goal?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman
 
& Chief Executive Officer
 
It does. J.B., do you have anything to that?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
We've 

 
I mean, as we've discussed previously, this is a small part of why 
the Gigafactory was 

 
we accelerated some of our plans there. 
And we're 
still on track to have first cell production starting at the end of this year so 
that we'll be able to ramp up to match the Model 3 schedule as well.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. Again, I sort of want to emphasize som
e comments that I made earlier 
in the earnings call, which is Tesla is really hell
-
bent on being the world's 
best at manufacturing. Like this is a big deal. And I think it's the right thing 
to do because what we're trying to do is get as many electric cars
 
on the 
road as possible. And what's the limiting factor? Well, it's production. Like 
how can we scale and scale efficiently? And so we need to get to 

 
we need 
to figure out how to be the world's best manufacturing and that's what we're 
going to be hell
-
b
ent on doing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.
 
Adam Michael Jonas

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hey, Elon. So on our math, your combined fleet of Model S and
 
X are driving 
more than 3 million miles a day. So in just one day, your cars do about 2x 
the distance that Google's done in the entire history of their self
-
driving car 
project. Now while your cars aren't exactly sensor
-
encrusted Christmas trees 
with tens
 
of thousands of dollars of equipment like a retrofitted Google car, 
it's still a lot of miles. And I'm just wondering if you can explain to the 
investment community what kind of advantage this gives Tesla in the race 
for sustainable transport an accident
-
free driving in some commercial 
financial terms, if you could. Thanks. Or even engineering terms.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I mean, I think you've pretty much asked the question and then 
answered it. Data is everything real
ly when you're trying to solve the 
autonomous transport problem. And having millions of miles per day of data 
accumulating and then as the fleet grows that grows proportionate to the 
fleet is incredibly helpful.
 
I mean, I think really, and particularly as 
we go to, say, kind of in the long 
term kind of fully autonomous driving, which I think is going to, I mean, 
that's going to require quite a lot of regulatory oversight, and I think in 
order for regulators to be comfortable approving that they are going to
 
want 
to see a very large amount of data, I mean, maybe billions of miles showing 
that the car is unequivocally safer in autonomous mode compared to manual 
mode in a wide range of circumstances in countries all around the world with 
different rules of the 
road and ways of behavior. And it'll have to be 
something statistically significant like billions of miles.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Well, that actually, Elon, leads to my follow
-
up. Which is, once high 
volumes of statistical dat
a for your autonomous miles are collected and 
analyzed, I can't help but get out of my mind 

 
I have this image of you and 
some CEOs of other auto companies and CEOs of other software and tech 
hardware firms testifying in Congress about the urgent need to 
replace these 
dangerous purely human
-
driven cars on the road with available affordable 
and proven, even L2
-
L3 technology or semi
-
autonomous that's ready for 
introduction to dramatically improve the epidemic of traffic fatalities as like a 
national public h
ealth and safety priority.
 
Am I crazy, Elon, about kind of that type of 

 
that role for people in your 
position to play armed with the data empirically? And if I'm not crazy, then 
how soon do you think it would take for tech firms like you to have a 
sufficient quantity and quality of data to be able to make such a scientifically 
proven case? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I already feel like 

 
I mean, Tesla will argue for autonomous driving, 
but we're not going to a
rgue against manual driving. And I believe people 
should have the freedom to choose to do what they want to do. And, yes, 
sometimes those things are dangerous but freedom is important. And if 
people want to drive, even if it's dangerous, they should be all
owed to drive 
in my view. But then the autonomous safety systems should be in there 
such that even if you're in manual mode, the car will still aid you in avoiding 
an accident.

Tha
nk you. Our next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital 
Markets.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Also wanted to focus on the adjusting 
the Gigafactory plans. I believe originally you indicated about 15 gigawat
t 
hours per year were earmarked for energy. And with Model 3 demand clearly 
robust and likely more robust than you originally planned, I'm wondering if 
that moved some of those Tesla Energy ambitions to the back burner? Does 
it accelerate the need for a se
cond Gigafactory? Or maybe perhaps you 
found a way to squeeze more out of the existing one?
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Well, I think the simplest answer is that we have a lot more capacity at that 
site than the initial 35 and 15 gigawat
t hours that we discussed. That's part 
of why we've so aggressively made sure that we have extra land and extra 
space around the site so that we can continue to expand. And we won't need 
to rob from Tesla Energy plans in order to meet the Model 3 schedule.
 
We 
definitely have a way to solve both.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And are you willing to provide an update to those initial targets?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Not yet. Maybe in one or two earnings calls from now I th
ink we'll be able to 
shed more light on that. But, yeah, as JB was saying, we're going to make 
sure Tesla Energy is not constrained by vehicle needs. And I think the 
growth rate of Tesla Energy is on a percentage basis only going to be far 
greater than the
 
growth rate in cars.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. We can all now see with t
he Model 3 
preorders that you are entirely correct that there is tons of demand for the 
car just like you've been saying all along. So I think about a month ago 
when you started tweeting those preorders, right, the investor and part 
supplier confidence in 
your ability to ramp to 0.5 million units rightfully 
skyrocketed. With that said, from a supply perspective, you have sometimes 
had difficulty in achieving delivery targets because of issues and smoothly 
increasing capacity and assembly and you've shown a 
strong preference for 
emphasizing quality over quantity.
 
So is there anything that's changed on the supply side of the equation that 
should also be confidence
-
instilling? Maybe, I don't know, lessons learned 
from the launch of X or some other factor that s
hould give confidence in 
your ability to be at a 200,000 unit to 400,000 unit annual run rate of Model 
3 production approximately 14 months from now?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, again, I want to emphasize that the July 1 date
 
is not a date that will 
actually be met. It's an impossible date. However, it's a date we need to 
hold ourselves to internally and we need to hold suppliers to. But it is an 
impossible date because there are 6,000, 7,000 unique components in the 
Model 3 a
nd that would assume that all of them arrive on time. And just like 
a college term paper, there are always late term papers. But you still have 
to have a deadline, and it needs to be real, and one with consequences if the 
deadline is not met. But it absolu
tely will not 

 
the probability of it is 
occurring is incredibly low of actually achieving it on July 1 but nonetheless, 
it's a date we have to take seriously.
 
I explained that with some risk of this being misinterpreted but hopefully 
you'll appreciate tha
t I am trying to explain how it needs to work and kind of 
has to work that way. There's no other way to do it.
 
And the things that help us get there are designing Model 3 for 
manufacturing with engineering, manufacturing engineering and production 
and supp
ly chain, all in a very closed loop and making sure that we design 
the car to easy to make, that we iterate with suppliers and ask them if we're 
giving them a design that's easy to make or one that's hard to make, or how 
do we make it, how do we reduce ris
k and improve it and make it easier to 
build? This is really fundamentally different from S and X.
 
The S was the first car we really designed ourselves, and it was all about 
just trying to make the car work in the first place. X was basically built off of 
the S platform, but then even more complicated, so unfortunately even 
harder to make. The Model 3 is the first car Tesla is creating that is designed 
to be easy to make. This is really a fundamental difference. And then I 
mentioned also increasing the scop
e of our in
-
house abilities so that if there 
is a supplier that is unable to deliver on time, we can scramble fast and 
produce that component in house.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of 
America.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Good afternoon. Just a first question on the capital needs. I mean, it looks 
like t
here's a little over $400 million left on the ABL, and given the preorders 
or the reservations for the Model 3, it seems like you'll have at least another 
$400 million flowing in in the second quarter. So just curious, I mean as you 
look at that kind of ca
sh potential or liquidity and potential inflow, do you 
really think you need to do a capital raise this year, or could you get by with 
those sources of cash?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I don't think we want to rely too much 
on customer reservation money 
as a source of capital. Maybe there is a buffer or something, but it's not as a 
primary source of capital. So yeah, I mean, I think it's going to make sense 
for us to raise some amount of money, some combination of equity and 
debt 
and make sure the company has a good buffer of cash on hand. I think it's 
important for de
-
risking the company.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. And then...
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
John...
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch
 
Yeah.
 
Jason Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
This is Jason. The only thing I'd add to that is we did draw $430 million on 
the ABL this quarter. A lot of that was we had a large amount of cash in 
transit at the end of the quarter. Our
 
deliveries were a little bit back
-
end 
loaded. And as those cars were delivered in early April, we were able to pay 
a significant portion of that back.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. And I think most people are familiar with ass
et
-
backed line, but it's 
important to say like why is that different from like general debt. Unlike 
other automotive companies, Tesla doesn't ship to dealers. We ship to 
customers. So we build the cars to order, the car is complete, and it's going 
to a kno
wn customer. So really the only risk associated with that is if like the 
ship sinks or something or the truck that's carrying the cars crashes. But the 
ABL is 

 
the asset
-
backed line is basically finished goods in transit to known 
customers. It's not like 
general corporate debt. It's, I think more 
appropriately thought of as, a slight increase in cost of goods sold.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask one follow
-
up from another 
question is, I mea
n, as you look at the ramp with suppliers, is there any 
recourse to suppliers that don't meet sort of that start of production next 
year or any point of the production schedule? Or is it really just you cancel 
the business and move on to another supplier?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. So we'll be asking for some commitments from suppliers to meet that 
timeframe and I'm meeting personally with the team from that supplier, who 
is going to execute on the task, so that I have not ju
st the commitment of 
the CEO or general manager of that supplier, but the actual team that will 
execute on the product, and we want to confirm that we feel confident in the 
actual team. And basically what we're asking for are the A team from the A 
supplier
 
and a commitment from that A team that they intend to work 
harder than they ever have on any other program. And if they are willing to 
do that, then we'll work together, otherwise not.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
And recourse if they mi
ss targets?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes. So along the way, we will be assessing progress and our confidence 
level that suppliers will meet the July 1 target. If it looks like they will not, 
we'll have a conversation with them. 
If our comfort level drops below a 
certain level, they will not be a supplier to Tesla.

Thank you. Our next 
question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, everybody. A couple of questions. One, distribution and franchise laws in 
the U.S. have always seemed like they're an issue that they're going to need 
to be
 
dealt with at some point. Does this trajectory force the issue or is this 
something that you can accommodate even with the distribution constraints?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, first of all, it's worth emphasizing that the w
hole dealership thing only 
applies in the U.S. We don't encounter that issue anywhere else in the world. 
And what's happening is that dealers are using kind of vestigial legislation 
that was originally put in for a just purpose, which is to protect them fr
om 
predatory practices from the franchisor, and then using it for an unjust 
purpose, which is to prevent direct distribution. We believe that in the long 
term justice will prevail.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. But is there a view tha
t you can actually achieve this even under the 
constraints that exist today, or is that something that you do need to 
address in order to achieve this plan?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We believe that that is not a constraint on ou
r ability to achieve the plan.
 
Rod A. Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. And second question is, I'm assuming that concurrently with this plan 
there is kind of a longer term plan for growth and that there is going to be a 
Fremont number two, and 
I think you've alluded to further expansion of 
Gigafactory. Can you just give us a sense of what you're aspiring to in terms 
of the trajectory by the end of the decade, as you've done before?
 
And Jason, I know you didn't want to get into details on project
 
spending, 
but it would be helpful just to pass along some thoughts on what needs to 
go into the company in terms of investment, in order to get that sort of 
thing out. Is it reasonable to assume that the new level of spending that 
we're seeing right now i
s something that we should assume as being a 
sustained level going forward?
 
Jason Wheeler

Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. On that, so yeah, at least I don't want to go into the details of what 
we think the total capital cost is going to be for the Model 3 
program, but 
certainly as we continue to ramp there's going to be more capital 
requirements of the company. That's just a fact. And ideally, I'd like to fund 
as much of that as possible with cash flow from operations. So that is really 
the focus that we ha
ve in the short term.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty.
 
Charlie Lowell Anderson

Dougherty & Co. LLC
 
Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I had just a
 
two
-
parter on the Model 3 
reservation holders. I imagine for many of them this was their first 
interaction with Tesla and maybe the first time they went to a store. And I 
wonder as you've looked at that base if there is any potential to upsell to a S 
or X
 
in the interim while they wait for their car, if you have any programs 
planned to address that. And then secondarily, I was curious if you have any 
color on sort of the geographic split of the reservation holders. Thanks.
 
Jonathan McNeill

President

Global Sales & Service, Tesla Motors, 
Inc.
 
Yeah. So this is Jon. In terms of your first question on whether or not the 
reservation orders, this was their first interaction with Tesla, just about 93% 
of the reservation holders, this is their first
 
interaction with Tesla. So it's a 
super, super majority of a new client base or a customer base for Tesla and 
it's exciting. It was exciting when we walked the lines, there were people 
waiting in line at the stores and they were excited to become a part o
f the 
Tesla community and family. And the demographics of the owners, we're not 
going to say much about that, but they are a bit different, as you can 
imagine, than the Model S and Model X owners today. And it presents an 
exciting new market for Tesla as w
ell.
 
And it should be noted that these folks are not interested just only in Tesla 
Motors, but also Tesla Energy, because the price point of the Tesla Powerwall 
is an accessible price point for many of these folks and so they're expressing 
interest in both
. In terms of S and X as a bridge to Model 3, we are talking 
through and thinking through that. Just as Elon mentioned earlier, the 
quickest path to receiving a Model 3 is being a Tesla owner. We've agreed 
that Tesla owners are receiving priority in terms 
of production, and so you 
can run the math I just mentioned. If 93% are new to Tesla, 7% of the 
reservation holders are Tesla owners. And the fastest way to get production 
vehicle even in 2017 is through Tesla ownership and so we're finding that 
there's a 
good conversion rate of folks that are coming in to test drive an S 
or an X who are Model 3 reservation
-
holders and are motivated to be Tesla 
owners now so that they can receive their Model 3 earlier.

Ye
ah, actually 

 
one point worth mentioning is that we're fairly worried 
about what would happen with the Model 3 announcement. Would it cause 
some big drop in, say, Model S sales? It seems to have had the opposite 
effect. It seems as though S demand has inc
reased. It has...

It has increased.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

It has increased.

CLSA Americas LLC
 
Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you guys about any early thoughts on 
need for manufacturing expansion. Obviously, if you are delivering 500,000 
units by 2018, I think that's the original capacity of the Fremont plant. So do 
you nee
d to start thinking about an additional plant? And in that context, 
any thoughts on global expansion you were mentioning? Obviously, very 
strong increase in Model S orders in Asia, for example. Anything you could 
share with us at this point?
 
Elon Reeve Mus
k 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I mean, I'd say our plans for international expansion and 
establishment of new plants are sort of speculative. We haven't made any 
firm decision. But I mean, some of the things are just sort of common sense 
that
 
manufacturing cars in California and then shipping them all around the 
world is not a very efficient thing to do, particularly as you go to more 
affordable vehicles. So, at some point, it's going to make sense to have a 
plant in Europe and a plant in Chin
a, and probably plants in other parts of 
the world. So that's kind of natural thing you'd expect. It's like it wouldn't 
make sense to ship cars from California to Europe or California to Asia.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel

In those volumes
.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
In those volumes. It's just not an efficient way to go. And particularly as we 
saturate on Fremont volume in terms of satisfying demand in North America, 
I think just to satisfy demand in North America
 
for our future product lineup, 
we're going to need more than one plant in North America just to satisfy 
North American demand.
 
Emmanuel Rosner 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Right. So when we think about these extra capital needs that you're sort of 
alluding to, in 
addition to just the 

 
obviously, the cost of the Model 3 
development, are you also contemplating as part of that to raise the money 
for an extra factory to the extent that just beyond 2018 you would already 
need some extra capacity?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chai
rman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I don't think we'll be raising money for new factories before we're at volume 
production of the Model 3. And as Jason was saying earlier, we'll really try to 
find as much of this as possible from operating cash flow.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Robert Baird.
 
Benjamin J. Kallo

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Hey. Thanks a lot. I have 18 questions. The first one I have, 
Model X 
production. Where are we at right there? Because we've had all this 
Consumer Reports issues, I think they're a little backdated, but can you talk 
to us about the state production of that? Number two. On the Gigafactory, 
the battery size with Model 
3, I think everyone is dividing by 80 kilowatt 
hours or 75 kilowatt hours to the number of cars. And how do we think 
about actually the Model 3 battery size and what the Gigafactory can 
support? And then the third question is why is Bob Lutz and Jim Chanos
, 
they keep on saying such negative things about you guys? What do you 
have to do to get the dissenters to actually believe in Tesla a little bit? Thank 
you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. So, I mean, I feel confident that we're
 
going to hit the 2,000 vehicle a 
week target by the end of this quarter, of which on the order of 40% are X. 
I'm just telling you that's our internal plan and what we expect to meet. 
There's no question the X is a very difficult car to manufacture. I thin
k it's 
unquestionably actually the most difficult car to manufacture in the world, 
and Bob Lutz would agree with that. I think he said something to the effect 
that he thought it wasn't manufacturable or something like that. I mean, it's 
certainly manufactu
rable. It's just a hard thing to go for.
 
So, I mean, we have some internal milestones that I think we've achieved 
thus far that I'm pretty excited about. Friday at 3 a.m. we achieved our first 
flawless production of the Model X, where we went through the w
hole 
production process and had zero issues. That was a great milestone. Still 
celebrating with the 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. Friday. It was great. And now we are 
starting to get several in a row that are flawless and so it's really gaining 
momentum very quickly. 
We feel pretty good about the trajectory of S and 
X.
 
As for convincing all the naysayers, I think that will basically be never. and I 
would just say like what I find ironic about a lot of the naysayers is that they 

 
the very same people will transition fr
om saying it was impossible to 
saying it was obvious. I am like, wait a second. Was it obvious or 
impossible? It can't be both.
 
Benjamin J. Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Got it. And Model 3 battery. We are all analysts here, we stir down our
 
straw 
dividing by 75 kilowatt hours. Is that the right thing to do with the Model 3 
or should we have a lower number like 40 kilowatts or 45 kilowatts? And 
then you've got the guy with the Volt making that car saying that it's going 
to be ahead of you guy
s and then sell for cheaper than you. So how do I 
think about GM being able to make a car cheaper than you versus making a 
margin on a Tesla with a lower battery cost? Does that make sense?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I mean,
 
we aren't going to get into real specifics on battery pack size, 
but I think it's fair to say that the average battery pack size for the 3 will be 
less than 75 kilowatt hours. That's...
 
Benjamin J. Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
I'm sorry, w
hat was that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
The average energy content of a 3 pack is certainly going to be less than 75 
kilowatt. It doesn't clearly need to be anywhere near 75 kilowatt to achieve 
the range of 215 miles. But we don'
t want to get into the nitty
-
gritty. It's 
probably unwise. Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Chief Technology Officer
 
Yeah. And, I mean, I don't think it's probably 

 
you probably don't need to 
fixate on the 35 gigawatt hours. We're planning the Gigafactory to m
eet the 
production needs of the energy that we know the cars will need. So there's 
not a problem in scaling that as we need to. So, obviously, internally we 
know the math and we know what we need to do and we're on track to do it.
 
Benjamin J. Kallo 
-
 
Rober
t W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Yeah. I guess, my 18th question is, so I'm not a car guy, but so I have a 

 
you guys have 40,000 units of the Model 3 in 2017. And from your 
commentary, it seems like I need to raise my numbers. But how do I think 
about that
 
ramp up from 0 to 500,000 over, let's push it from 2018 on? 
Does it go from 0 to 500,000 over two years? Or one year? Or how do we 
think about that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I mean, obviously if we're saying that Tesla wi
ll have total vehicle 
production of on the order of 500,000 cars in 2018, it would have to be 
more than sort of two years to get there. So, now, just sort of another 
maybe better education about production ramps is production ramps look 
like an S
-
curve. It
 
is extremely difficult to predict with precision the early 
part of the S
-
curve. So because in the early part of the S
-
curve, you have, it 
sort of starts off very slow and then it increases exponentially, it moves to a 
linear, and then moves to a logarithm
ic.
 
So, really, it's very difficult to predict exactly what the shape of that S
-
curve 
is, and that's where things get tricky because you end up putting quarterly 
results kind of bracketing somewhere on that S
-
curve, and depending upon 
where you are on that
 
S
-
curve, it can actually look like a big difference. But 
actually it could be a shift of a few weeks because of the exponential nature 
of the beginning of the S
-
curve.
 
Benjamin J. Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
And my 19th question, can you 
make 50% gross margin on it? Or 20% 
gross margin? Or how do you think about margin? Because people think you 
can't make it profitably...?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. I mean, we're highly confident that it can be made 
profitably and the 
design manufacturing and economies of scale are really the keys to 
achieving that outcome. Yeah, I think GM is not aiming for anything near the 
volumes that we are, and so they're 

 
I mean despite being a big company, 
their economies of 
scale are going to be driven by whatever elements are 
unique in their EV. And we know for a fact that they will not get the 
economies of scales that we will be at for Model 3.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Hull with Bloomberg News.
 
Dana Hull 
-
 
Bloomberg
 
Yeah, hi. What is the mix in 2018 of the 500,000 cars? I mean, it's combined 
S, X and 3. Should we think of it as like 300,000 3? Or I mean what's the 
kind of 
the mix of those 3 vehicles?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I mean I don't think we've got like an amazing crystal ball to figure out 
exactly what it's going to be. But I mean I feel confident about the top line 
number, but the 
mix internally is 

 
I mean it's difficult to figure that out. I 
mean, yeah, but maybe it's something like 100,000 to 150,000 S and X, and 
then 300,000 to 400,000 of 3. But this is, I don't know. It's really hard to 
say.
 
Dana Hull 
-
 
Bloomberg
 
Hard to say. O
kay. And then as you try to attract top manufacturing talent 
as you begin to ramp, have you given any thought to trying to hire a COO? I 
mean, I'm just thinking about your personal life, between Tesla and SpaceX, 
and sleeping in a sleeping bag and working 
90 hours a week between two 
companies. SpaceX has a great COO and has had one since the company, 
for years, but Tesla never has.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, the sort of scope of Tesla's activity is broader than SpaceX, and 
SpaceX is more of a pure technology company, and does not have the sort 
of sales service and kind of fleet management and customer financing and 
all that sort of stuff that Tesla has. Obviously, John's, John McNeill is taking 
that, has that role at Tesla, 
and then my focus is primarily on technology, 
design and manufacturing. So 

 
but I think you certainly can expect that 
there will be announcements in the fairly near future about some great 
executives joining the ranks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil LeBeau of CNBC.
 
Phil LeBeau

CNBC, Inc.
 
Hi, everyone. I have a question. It was about 10 minutes ago, you made a 
reference to 1 million vehicles in 2020. Is that a production target, a 
produc
tion goal, or hypothetical? I'm just looking for some clarification 
there.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, that's my best guess. Over a half million in 2018, and then roughly 
50%ish growth from there, then it's probably around 
1 million in 2020.
 
Phil LeBeau 
-
 
CNBC, Inc.
 
And do you not have an estimate as to how many production plants you will 
need in order to make that happen?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I think it is actually feasible, maybe not a
dvisable, but feasible to do it 
with just Fremont and the Gigafactory. We actually believe that Fremont and 
the Gigafactory could scale to a million vehicles. Whether that's actually wise 
is a separate question, and as I said earlier, it's going to make se
nse to do 
localized production at least on a continent basis. Otherwise your logistics 
costs end up being quite extreme. Your logistics cost start becoming a bigger 
and bigger percentage of total vehicle cost. I mean that's really why 
manufacturers build t
heir cars for a local market. They'll build cars for a 
market in that market because logistics costs associated with shipping one
-
and
-
a
-
half to two ton vehicle are massively greater than, say, shipping a 
little consumer electronics device.

Thomson Reuters Corporation
 
Hi. Can you hear me? Elon, you say that you're calling out to the best minds 
of manufacturing to join Tesla, but at the same time, Google and Apple are 
giving out the same haul. I guess I would wonder what you would say to 
these people to have them join Te
sla over these other companies. The 
second question is whether you had any takeaways in terms of your 
suppliers, in terms of Hoerbiger experience, and how you can hold these 
suppliers' feet to the fire on some of these more complicated tasks that they 
are 
asked to fulfill?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

themselves.

peo
ple with manufacturing experience.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-

Okay. Well, Tesla actually 

 
Tesla believes strongly in making things. They 
do not. That's fine, it's a philosophical difference. We believe that 
manufacturing technolo
gy is itself subject to a tremendous amount of 
innovation, and in fact we believe that there is more potential for innovation 
in manufacturing then there is in the design of a car by a long shot. And so, 
now, this is just a philosophical difference. Perhap
s we are wrong. But, in 
fact, we believe in manufacturing, and we believe that a company that 
values manufacturing as highly as we do is going to attract the best minds in 
manufacturing.

5/10/12,Tesla,"Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the rocket launch.
 
Elon Musk
 
Thank you.
 
Andrea James
 
So just quickly can you help me get to a free cash flow figure, looks like you 

operating cash flow 
to offset that?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, we will have clearly significant 
-
 
Deepak here, hi Andrea.
 
Andrea James
 
Hi.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
We would have significant positive operating cash flow, obviously as our 
business 
--
our volume gross and our gros
s margin continues to improve. 

expectation is that we will establish shop via warehouse line for leasing cars 
and that will continue to grow and fund the big portion for leasing funding 
requ
ired. So overall, we feel pretty comfortable where we are in terms of our 
2015 look from a cash burn perspective.
 
Andrea James
 
So maybe about $1 billion is that about inline of cash burn?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Should be less than that.
 
Andrea James
 
Okay.
 
Deepak Ahu
ja
 
Yes, considering that we will have a lease warehouse line which continues to 
expand.
 
Andrea James
 
Got it. And so then another point, it looks like you expanded your residual 
value guarantee into extra markets late last year. And then I saw last week 
you

my question is it looks like you have really pretty good demand, global wait 
times increases, so why continue to give incentives to buy the cars if 
demand is so high?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Sorry
 
Straubel.
 
JB Straubel
 
Well, I think fundamentally in China, we want to make sure we are not 
creating any hurdles or issues that create a negative customer experience. 
And charging installation given the varied regulations and challenges there 
has been a d
ifficult customer experience and they want to overcome that by 
providing [indiscernible].
 
Elon Musk
 

buying an BMW i3 or Elite something that considers the standard things. So 
we



like the all these extra car

bunch more customers in China, we could have [indiscernible] those cars.
 

forward to getting to demand constrain in the future. Essentia

matter whether we, meaning to the company as a whole, whether we saw a 
lot of cars in China or a small number of cars in China, [indiscernible] couple 

company, becau

long
-

good job. And I think just like the rest of the world, China wants to have the 
best products and we think the Model S is the best
 

indicated by a multiple outside assessment. I am pretty sure that people in 

sure, we take that right foundation for future growth. But it was essentially 
irre
levant to last year.
 

address is this perception that is as difficult to charge your car in China. This 
is false it is not difficult to charge your car in China. Unfortunately, this 
sounds kind of br
ain dead but our sales team was telling people that it was 
difficult to charge in China. Even though this is not true like that is pretty 
silly. And so I put the guy who was in charge of the supercharger rollout in 
China, is doing an awesome job, an engine

person, in charge of China to make sure that charging is super easy and 


people have
, where customers are trying to have a fantastic experience and 
then just like in other countries those customers become our sales force and 
the product sales grow by word of mouth.
 
Andrea James
 
So, is this a company philosophy because it seems like you ar
e putting 
engineers in charge of customer service even globally, with Jerome, I mean 
is customer service an engineering problem?
 
Elon Musk
 
I think if you have got people that are good at creative problem solving and 
they will 

 

problem solving. I tend to view I guess 
it is my own bias that most of things, since I am an engineer I can view 
things as an engineering problem. But not everything is an engineering 
problem, but I think it is like you got to design the system and sometim
es 
those systems are in the form of a car or discharging or it is way that you 
communicate with prospective customers it just create a problem solving 
[indiscernible] always as a creative problem solver who just gives back 
getting it right and that is what
 
we are doing. And I am confident that soon, 


China and if you look at sales, sales, our sales in Ho
ng Kong our sales in 

issue in Hong Kong. And everybody lives in apartment building as well, so it 

jus

see it in China as well.
 
Andrea James
 
And just to the point that thank you for the clarity on China. Just to my point 
on the residual value guarantee. Is that something that you plan o
n keeping 
and why keep it and what are your thoughts about that?
 
Elon Musk
 


matches what other premium sedans.
 
And see after three year time period 
but our actual residual values are substantially above that, so never actually 
matters. And we are not like paying up residual value guarantee are actually 
volumes especially about that so never actually matters, we ar
e not going to 
paying out residual value guarantees because the car is worth more than the 
residual value and 
-
 
this kind of messes up our accounting because we have 
to treat it like a pseudo
-
lease. On the other hand, if we withdrew it, then 
does that mean
 

 
would people take that as a lack of confidence in our 
product and if they might, they might misconstrue it as such. So even 


bably keep it even 
though it makes our financials look worse than they are really are.
 

versus non
-
GAAP, as though like when we do non
-

to trick people, an
d so thinking something is better than it is. But actually 

-
 
I think that the way the accounting rules currently 

of non
-
GAAP, not a less correct picture. 
The difference between 
--
 
from our 
gross margin GAAP and non
-
GAAP were basically the same.
 
So, when we look for revenue the difference between the GAAP and non
-

-
 
it comes down to just two things, this residual value 
guarantee, where we 
-
 
as 
we just talked about, it moot . But because of the 
pseudo
-
lease we have to recognize the revenue overtime, even though we 
got the cash immediately. So our cash flow with non
-
GAAP is the accurate 
representation of cash flow, which is what really matters.
 
An
d yes, so and then even in non
-

-
 
for leases that we do 

-
GAAP.
 
JB Straubel
 

flow.
 
Elon Musk
 
Exactly, exactly it is 
aligned to cash flow.
 
JB Straubel
 
Right, whereas in some other auto company the moment they sell the car to 
a dealership, we understand they recognizable full revenue, but even though 

h 
flows, but they have a GAAP revenue. So in some sense our non
-
GAAP 
revenue is pretty clean and it aligns up well with our cash flow.
 
Elon Musk
 

because like 
-
 
because there might be
 
--
 
are we perhaps exaggerating our 
revenues relative to how other car companies may represent their revenues. 
And what Deepak just said is a very good point. What the other car 
companies will do is they will sell the cars to the dealer groups, but then 
th
ey will then turn around and refinance those same cars. So they are 

 

actually more correct. Because if we do a lea

trying to sort of send it through some third
-
party where actually the risk is 
still assumed by the parent car company.
 
So yes, and then even for leases that we do ourselves, we can securitize 
those leases whenever we want
. So, we can take those leases, fund them 
and put them into a securitization program or just get a warehouse loan to 


s 
earning a 0.1% or basically nothing, actually minus whatever the inflation 
rate is. And so, it makes more sense for us to put that capital to work with 

but whenever we want to reco
ver that capital we can do so through 
warehouse balance securitization. Yes.
 
JB Straubel
 
Thank you for taking my questions.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

key point.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your 
line is open.
 
Brian Johnson
 
Yes, good evening. I wanted to explore a bit where you see the trajectory of 
CapEx and OpEx. You gave some guidance for next year, but as we kind of 
think ahead to the 
Gigafactory and as we think ahead to the model 
--
 
the 
Gen 3 launch, how do you see those trends going over the next several 
years.
 
JB Straubel
 
We are going to spend staggering amounts of money on CapEx. I mean for a 
good reason and with the great ROI. And 

CapEx in isolation because like that CapEx obviously is being done for reason 
in order to capture substantial future revenue flow. I am just saying the 
back
-
of
-
the
-
envelope 
--
 
if you make certain assumptions I emphasize th
ese 

occur, but I bet that they do occur, personally, that is my personal opinion. I 

we are able to mai
ntain a 30% growth rate for ten years added to your 10% 
profitability number and have 20PE, our market cap would be basically the 

-
 
on the order of 
$700 billion#. Obviously, getting [indiscernible] acq
uire some significant 
CapEx.
 

company. So maybe minor dilution, but nothing serious.
 
Brian Johnson
 
And how about in terms of operating expense and do you have a target for 
reported 
margins versus kind of thinking about your remarks in the second 

growing? Is there a difference between the margins on the non
-
GAAP basis 


kind of investments?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
You mean profit margin as opposed to gross margin?
 
Brian Johnson
 
Yes, yes the operating margin.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, I mean, we could easily get to 10%, 15%. I probably if we 
-
 
say 
somewhere betwee
n 10% or 15%. Because some of that gross margins that 
this year will probably, by the end of the year be somewhere around 30%. 
Then if 20 of those points go to sort of fixed cost and R&D and what not and 
then at least 10 leftover for profitability. And we 
are expecting to be non
-
GAAP profitable.
 
Elon Musk
 
And we have been non
-
GAAP profitable for two years now 2013# and 2014.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

means really profitable. It difficult to pass y
our question Brian in terms of 
separating OpEx between the fast growing company like Tesla versus 
steady
-
state, clearly we want to invest in the future, but we want to do it 
efficiently and we are going to focus on being efficient with our OpEx 
fundamental
ly this year.
 
Elon Musk
 

basically little over 10,000 people aiming for somewhere over 55,000 cars 
this year. Just get to 0.5 million cars a year if we do not improve our 
productivity pe
r person, we would need 100,000 people. I am not sure we 
would really park. So clearly there need to be dramatic improvement in 
productivity which are underway.
 
Brian Johnson
 
Right, and so when you said 10% was that 10% whilst still growing to the 
millions
 

you get to that millions of cars target?
 
Elon Musk
 

profitability in spite of nutty growth, because you just run out of
 
way to 

way to spend money. They spend money like it is water over there and they 

 
JB Straubel
 
I think for us we are a single vehicle platform company 
at this point for our 
engineering expenses have their ebbs and flows. So that has an impact, but 
as we grow will become a portfolio of vehicle platforms even with nutty 
growth we can get to a very good operating margin.
 
Elon Musk
 

like we are doing this 
--
 

letter , but there is massive infrastructure expansion going on like really 
massive like setting up service centers worldwide, creating an ubiquitous 
Supercharger network worldwide, just across all these 
countries growing 
with customs and the unique elements for each country. We are massively 
increasing this sort of scope and scale of Tesla in order to lay a foundation 
for future growth.
 
Brian Johnson
 
Okay, great. And just final question more for 
Deepak. When does CapEx 
slow into depreciation and gross margin, what kind of timeframes for the 
CapEx in terms of depreciable life spends, are you assuming on things like 
Gigafactory, factory drilling and so forth?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
So to answer your 
first question, when assets are put to use for production 

this year is on production capacity expansion and Model X tooling. Those the 
assets saw depreciation when Model X star
ts producing. The Gigafactory 
assets clearly will go into 
--
 
would be depreciated when we start producing 
cells that are being used for production and it depends on our revenue 
growth.
 
And the life of 
--
 
the depreciation life depends on the kind of asset. 
It can 

then it could be for 15 to 30 years. We follow the generally accepted 
principles there in our expected life of use to come up with those figures.
 
Brian Johnson
 
Okay, g
reat, okay, thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. 
Your line is open.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Good evening, everybody. First back China, do you have any concerns about 
your ability to pursue business in China on terms t
hat protect your interests? 

seem to have any problem with 50/50 JV structures or with bit local partners 
and not having control on selling through franchisers. Are you able to 
-
 
are 
t
hose terms that you are comfortable doing business with in China?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Well, I think we definitely going to 
-
 
want to have local manufacturing or 

make a ton of sense for the
 
long term to be building a huge number of cars 


mean, our goals in the short
-
term in China is just very 
straightforward which 
is just to build out our service and Supercharger infrastructure and just get 
the basic foundational elements there, and we are not going through dealers 
as we are not going through dealers anywhere in the world. So our activities 
in 
China currently are housed and Tesla
-
owned and it sort of depends on 
what the evolving landscape is in China as to whether, where, and how a JV 
would have to be setup .
 
Adam Jonas
 

t
he patents for competitors to use, any takers of any significant technology? 

this just a function of just 
--
 
kind of is it hubris and pride, or your 

e the kind of intellectual capabilities or 
software engineering depth to kind of contextualize what you have to offer.
 
Elon Musk
 

--
 
and that actually manufacturers are 
currently [indiscernible] use our patents, but just im
portant to remember 
the design cycle from the point of which you can use intellectual property, 

--
 

to do detailed engineering and design, you got to tool things out, and then 

 
got to go to production. So probably, the first time you see 
companies 
--
 
anyone using our IP would be three years after we announced.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Okay. And then finally, Elon just you mentioned, I think you said staggering 
amounts or obscene 

 
amounts of 
money on CapEx. Companies that usually 
have those kinds of spending ambitions at this point in the growth phase 
also have a pretty developed relationship with capital markets to help fund 
that growth, and yourself an Enterprise has been 
--
 
I think done tha
t quite 
successfully. Any heuristics, you can kind of leave us with as people kind of 
contemplate more cash burn being necessary to fund great things and great 
projects that will ultimately payoff. But any kind of rule of the thumb of 
minimum levels of liq

whether you need to kind of refill the capital tank? Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 

to that sort of crazy level that I described earlier wit
h really minimal dilution. 

--
 
overwhelming amount of that would 
come from operating cash flow. So yes, I feel generally pretty good about 

raise mo
ney is 
--
 

money, but the only reason I could mention we would do it is just to have a 
bigger cash cushion that will be in the 
--
 

the economy or something like that
.
 
Adam Jonas
 
Thanks very much.
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, our next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of 
America. Your line is open.
 
John Lovallo
 
Hey guys, thanks for taking the call. First question is your cash burn 
continues to be pretty
 
aggressive here. So the question is, if demand is 
strong as you guys are saying, and really the issue is on the supply side, 

-
 
offset the FX 

you get more demand than 

flow and investors and it will also support the residual values for your 
current owners. So it sounds like a win
-
win all around, so can you just 
addres
s that please?
 
Elon Musk
 



that costs $100,000. So I

into fundamental affordability limits. As it is, we are expecting to be 
significantly 
-
 
have significant positive cash flow in the latter half of the year.
 

-
ter

positive at the end of the year, and then going into 2016, even more so.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

the automotive industry, you have to invest in the CapEx for 
manufacturing 
capacity and then the cash flow comes through when you launch.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
John Lovallo
 


 
Deepak Ahuja
 

-
 
yes,
 
that is expectation and I think we got to have focus on the 
long
-
term, while this is a short
-
term issue in terms of timing of CapEx 
versus revenue.
 
Elon Musk
 
But yes, 
-
 
but to answer your question, yes, even in the face of significant 
CapEx, we expect to 
be cash flow positive in Q4.
 
John Lovallo
 
In Q4? Okay.
 
JB Straubel
 

-
 
it will be reflected 
most clearly in Q4.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

 
JB Straubel
 
Yes, exact

-
 
we have plenty of 
CapEx related to Model X.
 
John Lovallo
 
Yes.
 
JB Straubel
 
We have also invested in a bunch of things that actually, our volume 
numbers that are really better associated with Model III, so that $
0.25 
billion dollar paint shop upgrade is intended to be able to handle 10,000 cars 
a week.
 
John Lovallo
 
Okay, thanks. And then the next question is 
-
 
there has been a lot of 

from d
ifferent customers from persistent humming noises to complete 
failures, so the question is, I mean how pervasive is the drivetrain issue? 
What is the cost to replace a drivetrain? And I was a little surprised to see 
that the warranty reserves would not mov
e up quarter
-
over
-
quarter?
 
Elon Musk
 

people make 
--
 


at all. There was a period of time, basically for a month or 
two about a year 
ago where 

 
it was kind of getting into the weeds, but the application of 
grease on the spline of the motor was incorrect, and that caused the spline 
to wear out and stripped the spline on the drag in on the motor. So that 
particularly aff
ected sports, and unfortunately it happened to coincide with a 
-
 
when a whole batch of cars headed for Norway. So unfortunately 

 
it 

pains to try to address. Essentially what it amounte
d to fix that issue for 

remanufactured where we replaced the rotor and...
 
JB Straubel
 
And maybe to the warranty, this is JB, to the warranty reserve question, 

uite a bit a lot in our efficiency at repairing the 
drive unit. So it might be swapped for a given customer, but that unit 

repaired are increasingly narrow, and we are really targetin
g them quite 
directly, even the rotor can be repaired at this point.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. And there was a differential clunk that was causing a differential clunk 
which can actually be fixed with a two
-
part shim in the service center, so we 
were able to figure o
ut the service center fix to address that without even 
dropping the drive unit.
 
JB Straubel
 
Okay. All of the new units being built today, of course get all these fixes 
proactively as we learn the new product improves.
 
John Lovallo
 

finally, Elon, I just wanted to ask you about your 
comment about GAAP profitability not being reached until 2020, and I know 
you guys say that the non
-
GAAP ways 

 

disagreeing with that here, but what I am suggesting is
 

going to be GAAP profitability until 2020, and we kind of walk down from The 

-
GAAP number to a GAAP number by adding back 
stock comp, adding back non
-
cash interest expense, and making an 
assumption on the leasing,
 
my estimate would suggest that Street estimates 
are 30% to 60% too high because the GAAP component of that non
-
GAAP 
number would need to be eliminated. So if you guys could just help me think 
about if that math is incorrect, and more importantly, what is 
the path to 
profitability for Tesla?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure, I think people read too much into my comment because I was asked, 
when do I think Tesla will have full
-
year GAAP profitability, and sort of then 
you are going to the sort of residual varying [indiscernib
le] question like do 
we continue doing that or do we not continue doing that, because the half of 
the cars are financed, right. So, that basically chops our revenue in half in a 
lot of cases.
 
John Lovallo
 
Leasing as well.
 
Elon Musk
 
I mean leasing, so if le
asing and residual value guarantee of half the cars 
that would basically [indiscernible] affect revenue recognition, and then is it 

 



-
 
what that actually means is 

the non
-

was extremely optimistic, not a pessimistic statement.
 
John Lovallo
 
Okay, thank you guys.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Your line 
is open.
 
Ben Kallo
 
Hi, thank you for taking my question. A couple of different ones, first kind of 
a lower level one, as far as the X goes in timing, 
could you just talk about 
--
 
I know you reiterated deliveries in Q3 and just your confidence level around 
that, and then maybe one of the questions we get a lot is if we extend that 
to the Gen 3 and your 2017 timeframe, can you just talk about what work 
yo

 
Elon Musk
 


This feels like this paradox here is 

-
 
the X 
design is done.
 

point, and then making sure as we do the ramp up on X that out quality is 


hem 
-
 
have any sort of issues 
or problems, but it is really 

 
just like I said, it is just tooling and supply 

confident of delivering our first customer cars this summer and then
 
spooling 
up to significant volume in Q4.
 



 
we are being quite 
contentious about this, and I mean there are things that we could do
 
with 
the Model 3 platform that are really adventurous but with the schedule risk. 


Model 3 to begin with, but
 
we will then have the more sort of different 
version of the Model 3 on the Model 3 platform following the initial version, 
so that we can stay on track for Model 3.
 

-
 

to be 

 
that woul
d be too risky given the Gigafactory and everything sort of 

the initial version of the 3. So, I do feel confident that we can make that 
happen in the second half of 2017.
 
Ben Kallo
 
Great.
 
Elon Musk
 
As long as we stick to those principles.
 
Ben Kallo
 
Great. And question on innovation and releasing new features, what did you 
learned from the dual motor as far as the timing of new releases and how 
that impacts demand and how you do 
that going forward. I know you guys 
are constantly innovating on the car, but does that disrupt demand at all and 
how do you do that that you are now specifically during Model years, big 
advances.
 
Elon Musk
 

lly tricky because 
--
 
we 
basically have one car with variation. This would be much easier if we had 

there is going to be some new version of the car because then we are like 
worr
ied about starting near term sales. A lot of people wait to see what it is. 
So it is a real tricky thing and then we also, it is difficult to forecast the exact 

like how many people 
want P85D, we have no idea. It turns out a lot, okay, 
really a lot. And then we say, oh, we have too much demand for the P85D 
and now we got to figure out how to do that and then how many people are 
going to pick the next gen [seat] [ph] as it turns out al
so a lot. So we 

[indiscernible] about this in the future. But, yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
I think one thing in particular that we are working toward is to be sure that 
we are really ready to meet
 
the production demands at a much higher 
percentage mix if we announce something new, or an innovative new 
feature. And that is definitely I think a lesson we learned.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, agreed.
 
Ben Kallo
 
And my last one is on the storage side of the business.
 
Can you just talk 
about any developments there? We have heard some utilities looking for 
RFPs for utility scale projects. Are you guys at a position where you can start 
bidding on those RFPs or entering those RFPs, just give some update there 
and thanks g
uys.
 
Elon Musk
 
[Stationary] [ph] storage?
 
Ben Kallo
 
Yes, [stationary] [ph] storage.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, [indiscernible] we are bidding on a lot of RFPs already. Do you want to 
[indiscernible]?
 
JB Straubel
 

ut you are correct. Of 


these projects are very far out, since the procurement cycle for utiliti
es is so 
long. But this is a business that certainly is gaining an increasing amount of 
our attention.
 
Elon Musk
 

--

Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Your line is 
open.
 
Ryan Brinkman
 
Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you give us a sense for what you 
think your gross margin would have
 
been in the quarter if not for the 1,400 
deliveries that were pushed into 1Q?
 
Elon Musk
 
Actually [indiscernible] I mean there were a bunch of things that coincided, 
because we had to expedite 
-
 
[indiscernible] expedited shipping 
[indiscernible] make those numbers, we had massive [indiscernible] 


around there.
 
Ryan Brinkman
 

s helpful. And then just last question, is there any additional color 
you can give us on just the cadence of sales and production throughout 
2015 
-
 
beyond 
-
 

versus 4Q given that they should benef
it from the push out of those holiday 
deliveries and why production is forecast down sequentially too given that 
the full year has [guided] [ph] up so much and sort of beyond 1Q, what can 
you tell us in terms of when you expect to the implied inflection to
 
occur in 

or Model X or something like that. Thanks.
 
Elon Musk
 

ZEV credit. So if you added ZEV credit o

know, 29% or 30% something like that. So yes, in terms of the production 

actually two fewer weeks of production in Q1 versus Q4. One is becau
se we 
had to give 

 
we wanted [indiscernible] and certainly so gave people the 
first week of January off, because they have been working for Christmas and 


erate the factory in first week of January. And 
also [indiscernible] and then there is also one fewer production week in Q1. 

 

groundwork for higher v
olume in the remainder of the year. But obviously if 

you get towards the end of the year.

Our next questi
on comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. 
Your line is open.
 
Patrick Archambault
 
Thank you, yes, good evening. I just wanted to follow
-
up actually just on 
some of the comments you made about being less adventures for the X 
relative 
-
 
for the Mo
del 3, excuse me, relative to the X and playing it a little 
bit safer. Can you just give us a sense of what some of these characteristics 
and features are that you might have at one point been considering for the 
initial version that maybe put in place for
 
a later model upgrade.
 
Elon Musk
 

-
 
so yes, this is 
-
 
yes, with the X we had the 
Falcon Wing door, which is a first sort of double X rating gullwing door 
basically we called Falcon Wing door. Getting that right and making sur
e it 
works really well and [indiscernible] mechanic, but is a fundamental 
improvement in utility and aesthetics for cars is extremely difficult. And as a 

Model X is like it is a sec
ond row is [indiscernible] of sculptural beauty 

any car ever. That actually might have been harder than the door. And there 

bout yet.
 
But those who went to driving schedule [indiscernible] second row seat and 
the door. So then going to Model 3, we want to 
-
 
and I think we want to 

that for this feature w

-
 
it would make 
more sense just go with something that we know people are going to love, 


 
directions on that 
platform with future iterations where we are not 
-
 
we can then put aside any 
schedule and volume concern.
 
Patrick Archambault
 
Understood, certainly looking forward to seeing the X. Have you guys said 
when 
-
 
is there going to be any sort
 
of advanced 
-
 
sort of showing of it at 
any auto shows or anything some of the more bench prototype ahead of the 
launch that we should be looking forward to?
 
Elon Musk
 
Because there are these sort of different features that I mentioned 

e not going to show it until gets delivered.
 
Patrick Archambault
 
Interesting, okay, okay. Switching gears a little bit back on China, just on 
orders, I understand that the deliveries have been significantly impacted by 

scribed but how have orders been 


implemented to address some of the concerns whether they were justified or 
not. How have you seen kind of the Model S order book track, pre and sort 
of post those issues?
 
Elon Musk
 

-
 
the trend is positive already. So I think [indiscernible] 
improving every 

before like maps and directions 

 


onboard [indiscernible]
 
working which we will have soon, so there is a lot of 


 
Patrick Archambault
 
I mean it had been 
-
 
some had reported that orders had been coming in 
somewhere in the neighborhood of a 100 a day and 
-
 
which all obviously 
point to a pretty good annual run rate and is that sort of at least the order of 

back to in the 
shorter
-
term?
 
Elon Musk
 
The problem last year was that we had a whole bunch of speculators that 
were basically trying to buy [indiscernible] the cars and resell them at a 
higher price, which was not something we allow. So it gave like an inf
lated 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 

 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Even [indiscernible] 50,000 plus car shipped in China alone, [indiscernible] 

 
know what the source is.
 
Patrick Archambault
 

accounting clarification. I think in one of the pages you talk about direct 
leasing, impacting, I guess reducing, sorry, both non
-
GAAP and G
AAP 

actually addressed that a lot in this call, but non
-
GAAP I was just wondering 
why that would be impacted.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes, because we still hold the title for the car and we
 


non
-
GAAP financials, pretty simple.
 
Patrick Archambault
 
Understood. Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, but as I mentioned that we can always free up that
 
cash by securitizing 
our internal leases and/or by just getting warehouse loan facility. So 
[indiscernible] yes, [indiscernible], I guess what I would consider our real 
revenue is actually higher than our non
-
GAAP revenue, because of the 
internal [leases]
 
[ph].
 
Patrick Archambault
 
Got it. Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.
 
Elon Musk
 
And I mean the vehicles delivered to customers is really the key metrics that 

somehow and the 

key number.
 
Patrick Archambault
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.

Next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
 
Rod Lache
 
Hi, everybody. I apologize if this 

problems here, but I was hoping you might be able to help us with what you 
see as the run rate of sales for Model S right now and that bridge to the 

ou 
annualize what you did and add in the delayed Model D? Is that a run rate, 
and then to get from here to 55,000, where is China now? What does it need 
to be and what actually are you including for the Model X this year?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So [indiscernible] 
even if our sales in China were zero this year, zero, 


tell you with accuracy, but it really depends
 
on how the production ramp 
goes with the X when we start up this summer. And even small changes in 
that ramp can have quite a dramatic effect on X production.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

 
Elon Musk
 
Exactly.
 
Deepak Ahu
ja
 
Long
-
term makes no difference.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, exactly. If we are producing and I would say 800 Xs a week, and if 
-
 

-
 

tricky to predict it from 
-
 
I can much easier predict lik
e next year. Assuming 


year.
 
Rod Lache
 

n able to hit all 
these numbers without any advertising and marketing.
 
Elon Musk
 
And no endorsements, and no discounts.
 
Rod Lache
 

 
Elon Musk
 

 
Rod Lache
 

 
Elon Musk
 
Which is a 
very important point.
 
Rod Lache
 
And no franchise dealers and you know all these things that you know 
-
 


-
term to get to the 
vo
lume objectives that you are looking for this year and beyond, is 
-
 
are all 
of those in your view achievable while avoiding the franchise dealer model, 
while holding back on advertising and marketing and while in some cases 
even raising prices for example,
 
in Europe to adjust for currency or any of 
those impediments to the demand objectives that you have and would you 
modify the strategy in any way to achieve these volume numbers?
 
Elon Musk
 

year. I mean 


the dealers or anything like that this year and or discount the cars or 
anything like that. So 
if I 
-
 
I do want to emphasize that whenever you feel 
like a celebrity or some prominent person driving our car they all paid full 

the car and they are driving because they really b
elieve in the car, not 
because someone paid them to pretend that they do. So we may give them 
credit for the people [indiscernible] brought the car. So yes, I think we 
-
 
I do 
have a secret weapon on the demand side that will probably start to deploy 
later 

totally necessary but I think and it could be pretty interesting, I could 
[indiscernible] dealers.
 
Rod Lache
 
Okay. And just one last question I had, you mentioned in your letter that the 
ma
rgin was pressured half by revenue and half by cost factors. The FX part 
of this was pretty clear but there was a comment in there about deferred 
autopilot revenue, could you just explain, maybe just elaborate a little bit on 
what you meant actually in tha
t description of the margin variance?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
On that particular one, Rod, we announced several features that the 
autopilot functionality or hardware will deliver. Those features 
-
 
although the 
hardware is in the car, some of them will get activated t
hrough software 
releases later this year. And so based on the [indiscernible] aspect of 
revenue for accounting we had to defer some of that revenue into 2015. And 

 
Rod Lache
 
Okay. That variance versus the 28% original ob
jective or is that versus 
-
 
what was that comparison against?
 
Deepak Ahuja
 

for it, work through the whole thing and it 
-
 
as we deferred a significant 
amount there that had an impa
ct to our otherwise delivered car gross 
margins that would have been there.
 
Elon Musk
 

 
Deepak Ahuja
 

 
Elon Musk
 
Maybe 0.5% to 0.7% or something.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
And 
-
 
but most of th
at deferral will be taken care of this quarter with the 
software release next month which will add a bunch more functionality to 

planned for next month. There is a bunch of features 
in it that are going to 

capability.
 
JB Straubel
 
That is simply exciting.
 
Elon Musk

Thank you.

fore we go to the next question, I just want to do a time check 

questioners in the queue.

Our next 
question comes from Dan Galves with Credit Suisse. Your line is 
open.
 
Dan Galves
 
Hi, thanks good evening. I just had a question on the delivery guidance, if 
you adjust that for in this additional in transit vehicles I am just trying to get 
a sense of wheth

production for 2015 because my sense coming to the year around a 1000 a 
week is you could produce a lot more than that. So I am just getting a sense 
of 
-
 
what part of that is demand constraint and
 
what part is production 
constraint?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I mean we are all going to try to do a little better than the 55 number. 

But it is 
-
 

goes that can have quite 
a 

 



 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Correct, the gap between production and delivery time.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
And then we need to consider there could be disruption during launch of X 
and so when you are looking at that broad number of 55,000 or 
[indiscernible] there are things we n
eed to consider through the year what 
happens.
 
Elon Musk
 

deliveries and, yes, we are [indiscernible] making a conscious decision to 
focus on productivity this quarter, not just on 
ramping production, 
[indiscernible] production stability, in order to get that efficiency, like when 
we need to be building a firm foundation before future growth. And if we just 
in helter
-
skelter, production ramp, trying to just grow production numbers is
 
really hard to get productivity and that kind of fixes the foundational 
elements. So the conscious decision this quarter to [indiscernible] improve 
our core productivity. I mean running at [indiscernible].
 

ark. So we need to just get 
these productivity improvements in place so we can grow our production 
volume without proportionately growing headcount.
 
Dan Galves
 
That makes a lot of sense. And then just one kind of housekeeping question, 
you put the chart at
 
the beginning of the shareholder letter with revenue 
guidance for 2015. Is there anything in there for trade
-
in sales, for used car 
sales? And do you have any sort of sense of kind of what type of drag on 
gross margin sale of trade
-
ins will be?
 
Deepak Ahu
ja
 

now and our goal is certainly not to make that same kind of money on our 
used cars.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yeah, used cars also affect the capital 
-
 

there r

actually like the used car 
-
 
your margin is actually 
-
 

extremely good.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Right, when the dealers do make lot more gross margin on used cars than 
new cars,
 

 
Elon Musk
 

margin versus used car, service and other things.
 
Deepak Ahuja
 
Which brings up a good point that 
as we said at 
-
 
towards the end of our 
shareholder letter, starting for 2015 financials we are going to show our 
income statement slightly differently, the automotive revenues and cost of 
goods sold is truly new
-
car sales and then we have services and othe
r 
sections of the income statement that has all these other things including 
trade

Our next question comes from Trip Chowdhry with Global Equity Research, 
your line is open.
 
Trip Chowdhry
 
Thank you. Two quick questions. We see a lot of similarity between Apple 
and Tesla, bot
h cos 
-
 
both companies go for perfection, performance and 

instead of focusing on Model 3, and we just focused on say Model S, say 
Model X, but made them even better, you just focus on
 
increasing the range 
to say 400 miles, 450 miles, you already have the roadster which is at 400 
miles now, I think that would make Tesla very differentiated.
 
Elon Musk
 
Not quite 400 miles. The Roadster is sort of more like 360, but close to 400 
miles, yes
, with the upgrade. Capable of doing LA, San Francisco, but yes. 
And so, yes, I mean the goal of Tesla, from the beginning, has always been 
to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, and to make electric cars 
happen much faster than what was [indis
cernible]. So in order to do that we 
have to make lots of cars and we need to make them a heck a lot more 
affordable than S and X are today. Even with the Model 3 though, I mean it

S and X better and we will keep improving that platform really as much as a 
technology rol

JB Straubel
 
Sure, I can t


and more of the supply chain partners and understanding and learning about

s
ay there is a lot

maybe more incremental positivity on some of the 
commodities and some of the ways I think we can secure and procure 
pricing on some of the larger commodity prices that go into the cell.
 
Andrew Fung
 
Great, and any sense of when you guys 
may announce additional either 
suppliers or partners for the Gigafactory.
 
JB Straubel
 
We want to be a little bit cautious about doing that too soon. There is

Next question comes 
from Andrea James with Dougherty & Company. Your 
line is open.
 
Andrea James
 
Thanks for taking my follow
-
up, why did you guys promise the Roadster 3.0 
this year?
 
Elon Musk
 

-

economically is
 




 

thing one way or the other, slightly econ
omically just [unfavorable to] [ph] 
Tesla.
 
Andrea James
 
And so if I read through on the range communication on the Roadster 3.0 
and I just apply that sort of same range gain to the Model S I guess I get a 
350 mile to 400 mile range Model S by say 2017. Is 
that the right, I mean, 
is that 
-
 
is all the gains there translatable?
 
Elon Musk
 


-
 

not 2017 but it m
ight be say 2019 or 2020 or something like that. 
[Indiscernible] We can make the Model S go 400 miles today, if we wanted 
to by just increasing the pack size.
 
Andrea James
 
Great. I mean at the same 
-
 
I meant at the same cost, same pack cost say 
give $22,00
0 pack, will be 400 mile range the next couple of years, but 
seems that is a bit too aggressive.
 
Elon Musk
 
Next couple years is a bit too aggressive. If you go five years out, that might 


not two years but it might be five years.
 
Andrea James
 
Okay, and then just I feel like we should just generally ask your thoughts on 

on oil, but then more pointedly what
 
it does to the residual value of the cars 
and then also maybe the corresponding offset with lifting the value of ZEV 

 
Elon Musk
 

ert on oil business. 
But obviously fracking has massively increased the available oil reserves 
worldwide, fracking [indiscernible] more expensive than standard oil drilling 

a

-
term. Demand is 
certainly going to increase, sort of like how well the supply go to match that. 
But for sure oil companies are going to be scaling back their investments in 
new oil fields massively with
 
low price for oil today. So expect that 
-
 


 
Andrea James
 
But as it translates to the impacts on demand for your vehicles, and then 
also the residual value of those vehicles.
 
Elon Musk

it

it is not changing any of 
my projections [indiscernible].

2/17/12,Tesla,"All right. Thank you. My comments will be brief because I think it's really 

 
what I would have to say is captured in the earnings letter, but obviously the 
main thing is that we were able to have our best quarter ever, achieved full 
GAAP 
profitability and, moreover, I think we are headed to have a great 
fourth quarter as well.
 
One of the concerns I've seen out there is that perhaps Q3 was delayed 
(2:07) at the expense of Q4. This is not true, and we currently believe that 
Q4 will be profit
able, excluding non
-
cash stock
-
based expenses. I think 
there's actually a chance that we will be profitable even including non
-
cash 
stock
-
based expenses. There's just a chance. I would 

 
it's not a promise 
but I think we've got a shot at actually being pro
fitable even taking stock
-
based expenses into account.
 
So it's very exciting, and I think we're very proud of the Tesla team for 
executing so well on Q3 and going into Q4 and beyond. So, yeah. It's been 
great. Definitely one of the best moments ever in Tes
la I think. Jason?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Cool. Thanks, Elon. Just a couple of points I wanted to hit on real quickly 
before we jump into Q&A. One is I just want to point out the prudent 
financial managements that we've been able to 
accomplish over the last 
several quarters. An example here is back in 2015, we were spending $400 
million a quarter on CapEx. We've averaged about $250 million a quarter in 
2016. That will change as Model 3 starts to ramp
-
up in Q4, but we are 
focusing on m
aking sure that every dollar we spend is in its highest and best 
use.
 
From a gross margin perspective, if you look at automotive gross margin 
and you exclude ZEV credit revenue, we had 140 basis point improvement 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Lots of different fac
tors there. One, obviously, the 
increase in volume helps on the labor and overhead front.
 
Secondly, our reliability continues to get better and better. A big change in 
Model X over the last 12 months, as we highlighted in the letter, and 
continued improvem
ents in batteries and drive units across both vehicles. 
Another source of gross margin improvement is supplier sourcing and the 
wind
-
down of our commitments on prototype parts for Model X.
 
Third point on financial management. You can see our OpEx is growin
g sub
-
linear to revenue. The operating leverage that we've been talking about 
through the course of the year is starting to kick in. To put some real 
numbers around that, GAAP revenue was up 81% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, 
145% year
-
over
-
year and yet GAAP OpEx w
as only up 7% quarter
-
over
-
quarter and 33% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Second thing I want to talk for just a couple minutes about is what we've 
done to the capital structure and our sources of liquidity. As you may have 
read in the letter, we paid down $600 million i
n debt within the quarter. 
Most notably, $422 million of conversions on our 2018 converts de
-
risking 
the balance sheet in the future. In addition to that, we're able to sign a $300 
million warehouse line, which gives us more leasing capacity at great terms
. 
The terms on that vehicle are less than 2%. Also, we managed to get an 
80% increase with our largest North America leasing partner in the quarter. 
And we're also on task to sign
-
up a new leasing partner in Q4.
 
So, generally, I'd just like to point out th
at our access to capital markets and 
our sources of liquidity is as strong as it's ever been.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. In fact, just to highlight one element (5:34) of what Jason's saying, 
our vehicle gross margin increased Q2 to Q3. One 
of the other things I've 
seen out there is that, like, somehow we achieved these numbers as a result 
of widespread discounting, that is absolutely false. There were a few 
discounts that 

 
but they were few and far between and that has been 
absolutely shot 
down to zero. So you can see that in the fact that the vehicle 
profitability increased, even excluding ZEV credits from Q2 to Q3.
 
Jeff Evanson 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
All right. Chanel, I think we're ready for the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
O
perator
 
And our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Your line 
is now open.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. I mean it looks like a very strong 
free cash flow quarter. But when I look
 
through the balance sheet, there 
seems to be a pretty large increase in accounts payables and accrued 
liabilities that seems to have helped. How should we think about that going 
into Q4? Does some of that unwind? Were there any changes to buyer terms 
in t
he quarter, or is that just with the ramp in production?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Sure. Yeah. Great question. It's Jason. So, yeah, there was definitely an 
increase in payables and I think that'll start to unwind a little bit in Q4. A lot 
of t
hat is natural, I feel like the production, I believe, it increased 37% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter, so there's naturally going to be more parts coming 
into the factory. So I think some of that is just in the course of business.
 
And the other thing that I think i
s worth pointing out on the cash flow 
statement is receivables. We had a lot of deliveries right at the end of the 
quarter, so we weren't able to collect all of our receivables. We ended up 
with a fairly large receivable balance on cars that were delivered
 
in that last 
10 days or so.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Definitely also 

 
yeah, with emphasizing that, I mean it's a first 
approximation you expect payables to increase by 37% if you 

 
production 
reserve (7:46). And then you have to net out
 
against receivables. And when 
you do that, I think it's not really a 

 
it's not a material situation.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
No.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Got it.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
And we are 
actively looking to increase terms with suppliers. And I think as 
our production has been more predictable, suppliers have been much more 
open to that conversation.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. In fact 

 
yeah, in fact 

 
thanks for making that
 
point, Jason. I think 
it's worth emphasizing that for Model 3. The Model 3 system is designed 

 
the whole manufacturing supply chain system is designed so that the faster 
Model 3 production grows the faster Tesla's cash balance grows. So the 
terms that we
're getting from suppliers are significantly better, almost 60 
days as compared to about 40 days to 45 days for S and X. And Model 3 
production and logistics is way faster, so the car spends much of its time in 
the factory, and we're working on ways to exp
edite delivery of the vehicles 
to the end customer, which we can do when we have scale. We don't have to 
just wait for a ship to go somewhere. We can fill up the whole ship and just 
have the ship go anywhere we want. So the net effect is that instead of 
gr
owth being a capital consumer, growth is a capital producer.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Got it. And so, the other question I had is you're guiding to profit in Q4 
without ZEV credit, actually it sounds like without even the stock comp 
possib
ly, yet production is about flat. Model X is going to get a little worse, 
OpEx guidance sort of implies that's up sequentially. So what are the key 
drivers that are actually going to get you to profitability? But I think if you 
take out the ZEV credit, it 
would have probably been still a loss in this 
quarter.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, we expect gross margin to increase. And, I mean, that's a huge factor. 
(10:13) We're using very few prototype parts or low volume selling parts, 
and we're not
 
paying for crazy amounts of expediting. And there are a bunch 
of design improvements, design cost downs that , I would say, (10:32), 
actually 

 
that are either value neutral to the customer 

 
it's actually cost 
slightly better. And we have the P100. So th
e 

 
one of the things that 

 
the 
100 kilowatt hour car 

 
pack was only in limited production towards the end 
of last quarter, and it will be a pretty significant portion of the mix this 
quarter. So, yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think on
e additional thing is that the reliability of the cars continues to get 
better, so our warranty costs sort of decreasing as well. And that's a really 

 
that's a key driver for us, not only from the cost side but from the demand 
side where we're creating de
mand in market given the reliability of the 
vehicles.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. I mean, the reliability improvement is massive.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
It is. So the visits to service for Model X through the course of the 
year 
declined 92%, which is just a fantastic result both from the manufacturing 
side. And the vehicle reliability teams have been working hard to achieve 
that. And we're going to continue to improve against that.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jeff Evanson 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Are we good, Colin?
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Should I go ahead and take one... (11:44)
 
Jeff Evanson 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
All right. Chanel, let's go to the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And ou
r next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with 
Barclays. Your line is now open.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes. Good afternoon. I just want to go in a little bit on regulatory credits. A 
couple of things. First, clearly, with your
 
delivery numbers, the California 
and the other CARB states are buying more Teslas, yet last quarter you 
talked about the value of those plummeting and we shouldn't really expect 
much, so kind of 

 
obviously you're generating more. But a couple of 
question
s. What's happened in the marketplace for those credits? And I 
know even under GAAP you don't list that as a balance sheet asset, but if we 
were to think about the quarterly generation of credits as well as the credits 
on your 

 
in effect in, your car bank
 
that can be monetized in the future, 
how would we think about those?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, unfortunately, as I've said on record before, the CARB ZEV credit 
mandate is incredibly weak and needs to be fixed. And when you have a 
weak ma
ndate, obviously the value of those credits decline conservatively. 
There were some quarters where we simply cannot even find a buyer for 
credit. And then when we can find a buyer, it's typically $0.50 on the $1 for 
the ZEV credit. So 

 
and then 

 
obviousl
y the ZEV credit is only applied to 
about roughly half of our market in the U.S., maybe slightly above half. It 
doesn't apply to Asia, or Europe, or Canada or Mexico or anywhere else. So 
it's there, and I think CARB really should be doing more. It's unfort
unate 
that they're not.
 
And then 

 
I need to maybe write a longer blog piece sort of going through 
this, but Tesla's sometimes criticized for relying on kind of tax credits and 
that kind of thing. People really misunderstand this. What matters is, what 
does Tesla receive relative to its competitors? Not, what does Tesla receive 
in the absolute?
 
Our competitors 

 
it may be worth noting 

 
maybe you would consider this 
to be a risk or something that is problematic for us. Our competitors 
monetize ZEV credit
s at 100 cents on the $1. We monetize them at $0.50 on 
the $1 where we can get it. That means if you have, let's say 

 
it depends 
on the scenario, but if you have, let's say, 3 ZEV credits for an EV, then it 
would be essentially be worth $5,000 each. So th
at would be $15,000. So 
when, say, Jim or somebody sells an EV, they get $15,000, but when Tesla 
sells an EV, we get half of that.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Right. They have an internal market.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
It is not
 
we who are being subsidized but our competitors.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
So now...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Now the interesting thing is that there is a limit to our disadvantage. 
Because of them, credit thing is so weak, it 
only goes so far. It only applies 
to certain states. So what you will see our competitors do is they will limit 
their production, and they will only sell in ZEV states or almost entirely in 
ZEV states. That doesn't scale. That will take them to maybe 40,00
0 units or 
50,000 units a year, best case, but we're talking about doing 500,000 units 
a year.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
And...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Which means at high volume, we no longer suffer, be disadvantaged of the 
cr
edit regime. This is wholly misunderstood.
 
Jeff Evanson 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Does that help, Brian?
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yeah. And just a quick follow
-
up on the GHG (16:10) credits. Were there 
any?
 
Jeff Evanson 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Say
 
again, Brian?
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Just to follow
-
up, were there GHG or other CAP A (16:18) credits? And how 
do they compare to prior quarters?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Those are mouse nuts.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Cap
ital, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Jeff Evanson 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
All right. Let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line from Colin Rusch of 
Oppenheimer.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Thanks so 
much. Can we just look at the shipment numbers? So a quarter 
ago you were guiding to roughly 80,000 vehicles a year, and now three 
months later we're down at 75,000 vehicles. Can you just walk us through 
the factors that are impacting that lower shipment n
umber 

 
or delivery 
number, I should say?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well I think this was really gone over in last quarter's call is that we had 
other problems getting to rates in the first half of the year, rate being an 
average of roughly 2,00
0 cars a week. Just a lot of things broken in our 
production system.
 
I personally probably took a year off my life or more camping out at Fremont 
(17:27) factory solving that along with a number of other members of the 
Tesla team. We went through bloody he
ll in the first half of this year. We got 
out of that basically around mid
-
June, and then the result is achieving a 
weekly production target of roughly 2,000 cars a week.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Okay. Maybe I can take that offline. So then the
 
second question for me is 
really about absorption. With nearly 40% increase in deliveries, can you 
guys breakout the impact on gross margin to absorption? It would seem that 
that would be a meaningful number at this point.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, 
Inc.
 
What are you talking about?
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Factory absorption.
 
Jeff Evanson 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Do you mean like fixed costs versus...
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Yeah. Fixed costs on the factory, and how that flows thr
ough the 
depreciation line.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Sure. I mean the way to think about that is 

 
I think Elon actually just 
covered it in his last answer. We had capacitized the factory and had the 
factory obviously produce much more 

 
many 
more cars in the first half of 
the year and we fell short of that. And now we're at the rate that we had 
planned to be at early in the year, so our absorption is about what we'd 
expect it to be. And I think what you're seeing now from an absorption 
perspec
tive as it's related to gross margin is a good steady
-
state rate.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Okay. I was just looking for a quarter
-
over
-
quarter number in terms of the 
contribution margin.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
No, we typically do
n't break down all the different factors within gross 
margin.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Sure. No problem.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan 
Brinkman of 
JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the drivers of the 
substantially less
-
than
-
expended capital expenditures in the quarter and the 
reduction to the f
ull year CapEx guide? Should we think about this as being 
more about the push
-
out or delay of certain activities that give rise to 
CapEx? Or is it more that you're on schedule with those activities but doing 
them in a thriftier way or some sort of combinat
ion of these factors?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
One thing that we found (19:42) is way better with 3 program than X and S 
is that our equipment suppliers are willing to work with us on payment terms 
and repayable to back
-
end load and, in fact, p
ost
-
production mode, a huge 
amount of the CapEx. So that just turned out a lot better than we expected. 
But we've not taken any action that would cause the Model 3 timeline to be 
extended in any way.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve
 
Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
We're still highly confident of reaching volume production in the second half 
of next year.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. If I might chime into that a tiny bit as well, we are also continuing to 
improve the capit
al efficiency per unit of the production lines. And especially 
over the last few months, we've put a huge amount of engineering intention 
into really focusing on that problem and we're seeing results, and I think 
we'll continue to see incremental improveme
nts all the way from the things 
like the battery cells all the way up to the vehicle itself.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. And then the follow
-
up to that is just in regards to the amended S
-
4 
that you filed a couple weeks back. There was so
me changed language in 
there from, Tesla is currently planning to raise additional funds by the end of 
the year to now stating that you expect adequate liquidity through the 

 
at 
least the end of the year, I think it says. So what was the primary change, 
w
ould you say? Does it relate to this CapEx issue that we're talking about 
here or to higher earnings or to another factor?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. I think it covers all the above. So we've gotten really good at capital 
efficiency. JB, w
ho was just speaking, has done a great job of that up at the 
Gigafac in particular. And we're 

 
I think we're just executing very well. We 
met our internal targets for Q3, so 

 
and you see what happened on the 
cash flow statement. So I think it's operation
al execution as well as capital 
efficiency.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks a lot.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
One thing that's worth mentioning and, certainly, I would take this with a 
grain of salt and not like it's 

 
like 
sometimes, I'll say things which I think 
are sort of speculation or my best guess but they are not 

 
it's different from 
a promise. Our current plan 

 
our current financial plan does not require any 
capital raise for Model 3 at all. So now that's different
 
from saying whether 
we should raise capital or not to account for uncertainty to have a larger 
buffer and to sort of de
-
risk the business. So 

 
and then we also feel pretty 
good having examined the SolarCity financials that looks like SolarCity will 
actua
lly be, I believe, neutral but perhaps a cash contributor in the fourth 
quarter in a small way.
 
But again, does not 

 
do not take this to the bank, this is not a promise. This 
is like 

 
this is what appears to be the case. So contingent upon shareholder 
ap
proval, we expect SolarCity to be somewhere between neutral and a cash 
contributor in the fourth quarter. And yeah, I mean things are looking good. 
Yeah. It's not to say that there's some darkness ahead, they look really quite 
good right now. It seems like
 
we probably weren't wanted to capital raise 
even in Q1. I'm not saying we won't, but probably not. And yeah 

 
so we're 
looking quite promising.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. The other thing I would just add on top of that is, is just go back
 
to 
some of the comments I made at the beginning of the call about our others 
receivable liquidity, and the capital markets are open to us. And as our asset 
base gross, our ability to monetize those assets increases. We've got our 
ABL line. We've got the $
300 million warehouse line. And so we've got the 
things, and we've also been able to lineup a bunch of incremental capacity 
on the leasing side in the quarter as well. So that's definitely a piece of it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner 
of CLSA. Your line is now open.
 
Emmanuel Rosner

CLSA Americas LLC
 
Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions on your recent announcement 
around autonomo
us driving. So I guess the first one is on hardware and 
then the second one on software. On hardware, it seems like 

 
at least from 
the outside where we're sitting, it seems like just recently you were 
indicating you will be de
-
emphasizing the vision appro
ach to ADAS and 
autonomous driving. And now it seems the latest hardware seems largely 
based on vision. So I was curious, how 

 
what was the thought process 
there? And still within hardware, how do you acquire confidence that the 
hardware you're putting in
 
cars today would still be adequate to take you all 
the way through full autonomy when it's only based 

 
or largely based on 
vision?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. First of all, I would separate what Tesla says from, say, some supplier 
of 
ours is issuing, bullshit. Okay? The blog that I wrote was very clear that 
radar is moving from a supplemental to also a primary sensor. It is not to 
the exclusion of vision, but it is also a primary sensor. Vision is still the main 
thing, but radar, inste
ad of merely being, like, a cross
-
check against vision is 
really, when done well, and we're very confident at this point that it can be 
done this way; it can be a primary sensor such that you can take actions 
based on radar information alone. You can also 
take actions just based on 
vision alone. Much as a person who might take action based on whether you 
hear something or you see something, but you don't need to both hear it 
and see it. Yeah, so, there's no 

 
we feel highly confident that the 8
-
camera 
solut
ion with 12 ultrasonics and a Ford radar, and the computing power that 
we now have onboard is capable of full autonomy at a 

 
it's simply greater 
than human (26:44). There are obviously skeptics out there. Well, I suggest 
that they do not bet against us.
 
E
mmanuel Rosner 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Okay. And then on the software side, I guess a lot of the players involved in 
developing autonomous solutions seem to think that a big input for 
autonomous driving, especially higher levels of autonomy sort of a map, a 
li
ve updated map. What are 

 
there was not a lot of new information on the 
most recent announcement on this. What are Tesla's plans for this part of 
the solution?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think we're getting into like technical questions that a
re not really related 
to this quarter. So we'll have to pass.
 
Jeff Evanson

Yeah.
 
Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merri
ll Lynch
 
Good afternoon, guys. Just a somewhat of a redundant and follow
-
up 
question here, but I really just want to make sure I get this right. I mean, as 
you're looking at R&D and CapEx, I mean, those are two items that, as we're 
looking in, a very signi
ficant product launch next year are kind of running at 
very, very low levels. I'm just curious, as you're talking about this, do you 
think that 

 
well, I mean, no, they're not that low, but I mean relative to 
what we would expect ahead of a product launch,
 
do you think that R&D at 
absolute levels can stay here and support the Model 3 launch and everything 
else you're working on or that need to go up? And then also similarly, I 
mean, this CapEx number of $1 billion
-
plus in the fourth quarter really is a 
sign
ificant step
-
up. I mean, is that really just too high a number, and you 
guys really are running significantly lower than this $2.5 billion, lower than 
the $1.8 billion, maybe something significantly lower? And really finding a 
massive amount of efficiency 
here? And I'm just really trying to understand 
what these levels are going to be because they are very impressive to
-
date.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Sure. I can take the R&D piece. I imagine that R&D will continue to go 
up.
 
Elon Reeve Mus
k 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Not in giant ways.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Not in giant ways, yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Moderate increases in R&D are to be expected, but not some, like, sort 
of not a step change.
 
Jason S. 
Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Exactly. And on the SG&A side, that's where we're really finding a lot 
of our operating leverage. On the capital front, again I think there's just 
continued opportunities for us to optimize this.
 
There's a whole new parad
igm of thinking that we're going through, and it's 
breaking through conventional norms such as to add a step change in 
capacity you have to add a step change in capital, that's not true. You can 
always optimize things. You can make things move (29:48) fast
er. It can be 
more efficient. You can use floor space better.
 
So I think it's some of this thinking, which Elon has talked a lot about, is 
really getting baked into our capital plan.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. And maybe it seems low rel
ative to the traditional industry, but I 
guess if we're comparing to what we've done in our past 

 
and even if we 
just look at the...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. It seems like a lot of money to us.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
..
.S program was actually quite a lot lower R&D and lower CapEx than this. 
So it feels like a huge amount of money.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
But, I mean, you guys really are running at a run
-
rate that is half of what 
you 

 
or less than 
half of what you were originally talking about for the year 
on a run
-
rate basis, and I'm just trying to understand if that's something 
that is more realistic? Or we should expect a real big step
-
up in the fourth 
quarter?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, In
c.
 
If you go back to actually our guidance at the beginning of the year on the 
OpEx side, I believe our initial guidance was 25% year
-
over
-
year, and we 
bumped that up to 30% year
-
over
-
year. So there's...
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
I'm s
orry. I meant on CapEx.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
On CapEx, our original guidance at the beginning of the year was $1.5 
billion, and then when we made the initial announcement to bring forward 
production of 500,000 vehicles into 2018, then we b
umped it up. And I think 
now we're just getting smarter about that, and that's why we brought that 
guidance back down in the letter this quarter.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. We're probably just too conservative on our capital projections, bu
t it's 
turned out to be that we can do this with less capital than anticipated.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. And just one follow
-
up on mix. I mean, these 100
-
kilowatt hour 
models 

 
I mean, it sounds like, in some ways, you may hav
e 
underestimated the high
-
end of the market, which is a good thing. I mean, 
as we think about that as a percent of mix going forward, I mean, do you 
really think there's a tremendous opportunity for that to be a material part 
of the mix?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yes. It's one of my 

 
I mean, right now, there are like three things that are 
top priorities for me. Obviously, Model 3 achieving rate, schedule and costs 
on Model 3 as top. Then it's advancing the Autopilot to self
-
driving software, 
and
 
then it's the 100
-
kilowatt hour, trying to ramp
-
up the 100
-
kilowatt hour 
production rates.
 
I receive daily updates on the 100
-
hour kilowatt hour production. After this 
call, I am going to be on the 100
-
kilowatt hour production line because the 
demand is h
igh, and we just need to satisfy that demand.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. It just seems like that almost might be more important as far as 
profitability and cash flow in the near
-
term than the Model 3. It's just 
because...
 
Elon Ree
ve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, definitely in the near
-
term. I mean, that's 100% certain.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
But even over time. But okay. Thank you.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, yeah. It's a super big 
deal. Seven days a week I get an update on the 
100
-
kilowatt hour progress, on the production ramp of that.

Your l
ine is now open.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Hey, Elon. If I can ask a question about SolarCity. One of the things that I 
cover SolarCity and you guys bought Silevo, my initial reaction was to be 
negative on it. And one of 
the things that I'm worried about with the 
transaction that you guys acquired or merging is the Buffalo deal. It's just 
being a cash cow. And so I was relieved when I saw Panasonic step in. So 
can you talk know more about that? And then maybe in the same q
uestion, 
how 

 
I saw this, the slide deck yesterday about how their business model is 
changing from lease to more cash sales or loan sales. What do you expect 
going forward, and maybe that's Jason, from a cash flow basis? I know you 
said Q4 relates to that
, but can this be cash accretive to the business next 
year? Thanks. And then I have one follow
-
up.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think 

 
I expect SolarCity to be approximately cash neutral, all things 
considered, next year. Yeah, it does depend on
 
how fast we ramp
-
up 
production in Buffalo. And by the way, I think first thing (34:37) in your 
question you said cash cow? I think you maybe meant to say cash vacuum. 
But we do 

 
in your question, that's all what I'm saying it is. We do think it's 
importa
nt to have tight control over the production of the solar panels in 
order to really 

 
in order to have a beautiful solar roof product, we've got to 
be able to iterate rapidly and have them made exactly the way we want 
them so that you have very high effici
ency cells at the lowest cost. That's 
our objective. Just as we've been able to achieve that in partnership with 
Panasonic on the battery front. We have the best cell at the lowest price. 
That's a really good place to be. And we're confident we can achieve
 
that 
same outcome in solar.
 
And while also creating a solar roof product that is better than a normal roof, 
looks better than a normal roof. Now, the market (36:01), as I mentioned 
before, that there's like, if somebody has just installed a roof and their
 
house is new, it's not going to make sense for them to go re
-
roof the house. 
It does make more sense to have something that's solar panels are added to 
the roof. But for someone that is building a house or where the roof is 
nearing its expiry date, then t
he solar roof is the right option. So the nice 
thing is you don't really cannibalize one from the other. They're two separate 
markets. And I think you'll be (36:39) quite pleasantly surprised by what we 
debut on Friday. It has exceeded my expectations. And
 

 
yeah, but I don't 
want to jump the gun on that. You should really see what we unveil on 
Friday. I think it's really great.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
And then one more maybe big picture, I'll probably get made fun of th
is for 
asking, but, stakeholders, I watch what the work you're doing at SpaceX and 
the statement you said about the reason you want to make money is for 
your work on inter
-
planetary transport. How do you judge a Tesla 
shareholder versus a Tesla car holder?
 
How do you delineate between where 
you give value versus the different stakeholders in the whole group there?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I don't really think about it like that. It's really just we want to make 
products that people love. And the
n make enough money from that to be 
able to develop new product. And that's it really. There's like so few 
products, like, how many products can you buy that you really love? So, 
rare. And I think if you do something like that, people will buy them. They 
w
ill pay a premium for something that they love, of course. Yeah. And then I 
think it ends up being a good outcome for shareholders because the whole 
purpose of any company existing is to make compelling products and 
services. Some of those people lose sigh
t of why companies should even 
exist.
 
Benjamin Joseph Kallo 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Like, for example, would you scale back the growth of SolarCity, even 
though it's the greater good for the environment to be more cash flow 
positive, I guess
 
is a good way to look at it?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I don't think 

 
you know, we have to look at this in long
-
term. And if 
SolarCity's moving lots of money, then that's not good for the long
-
term that 
investors will not support such a situat
ion. So 

 
and I think there may be 
some intermediate slowdowns, but this is actually with an eye towards 
ultimately moving way faster.

Great. Thank you and good afternoon. Wanted to ask a question, if I may, 
on battery costs and particularly just kind
 
of an update on the Gigafactory 
and the impact of the Gigafactory on battery cost. It seems as we're getting 
closer to the opening that while there is some improvement sort of going on 
in the background in terms of efficiencies of the battery cell product
ion 
process and also the trade secrets that you're working on between 
generation
-
to
-
generation of cell production that at least 30% benefit from 
the Gigafactory. How should that filter into the model, let's say, over the 
course of the next, kind of, six mo
nths to eight months between now and 
maybe when you start to talk more about Model 3 production? Thanks.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, I'm not sure we want to give a detailed glide slope on this, but we're 
still very confident on the 
progress against the milestones we talked about 
previously. We're still confident that we'll have the very 

 
the best cell cost 
in the world when we start production. And I think those are really the most 
important metrics. In long
-
term, we see ongoing opp
ortunities to keep 
driving that down as we add innovation into the manufacturing process and 
keep increasing scale.
 
Jamie Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
And just to confirm when you're still expecting to sort of begin production on 
the Gigafactory,
 
itself. And then just a quick product question as it relates to 
what you've done with the Model S and the 100
-
killowatt battery pack. 
Thinking about a fully loaded, optimized Model 3 which obviously is smaller 
vehicle. Is there potential to see range 

 
ag
ain, this is not a price
-
sensitive 
question, but at the high
-
end of the Model 3 side, is there potential to see 
range extend significantly further than what we're seeing with the S and X? 
Thanks.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, maybe to your
 
first question, I mean we're still generally on track, as 
we stated, with the Gigafactory schedule and production. There's equipment 
being installed and being commissioned as we speak. There's a fairly 
extensive process of bringing that equipment online, 
starting up pilot 
production, validating the pilot production. So I mean that's exactly what 
we're in the middle of and continuing to ramp
-
up through the end of this 
year. So we feel good about where that's at, and we feel that we're 
definitely on schedule
 
for production for Model 3.

Hi. Just one question about the Autopilot software development. As you guys 
are putting the hardware and the software and learning capabilities in the 
entire fleet of incremental production, you're going to have lots and lots of 
very rich data that is goin
g to be brought to you for analysis and processing 
and learning. And I guess the question is when, Elon, would you say would 
be the earliest reasonable opportunity for you and perhaps backed by the 
scientific community and your own community in your compan
y, to make a 
strong case to the regulators with the empirical data as you get and analyze 
it as a safety of the vehicles, even if not in a fully autonomous application 
but even the semi
-
autonomous so that you can bring more visibility and 
transparency to t
he urgent need to address the spiraling death and injury on 
our roads? Thanks.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Well, I should say that we do actually, very closely on a daily basis, 
and have for a long time, with NHTSA and other regulatory entit
ies around 
the world really at a very detailed level. So they're certainly aware of, kind 
of, the nitty
-
gritty, and as I've said before, we already see a significant 
improvement in safety with semi
-
autonomous features.
 
And what's sort of less visible to th
e outside are all the cases where the 
version one of Autopilot actually did a lot to mitigate the accident so that the 
impact velocity went from being potentially fatal or severe injury to 
customer stepped out and walked away. There are many of those which
 
provides a much more statistically significant sample set than the fatalities, 
because the fatalities are extremely rare, and you need really 1 billion miles 
or more to try to achieve a statistically significant conclusion on fatalities.
 
But as our fleet 
grows, and it's growing rapidly, the number of semi
-
autonomous miles grows to the point where I think we're now starting to 
approach almost 1.5 million miles per day of Autopilot 

 
all kinds of road 
conditions and weather throughout the world. And then the
 
more time that 
goes by, the more miles we accumulate, the stronger the argument gets 
about the confidence interval tighten and it becomes clearer and clearer.
 
So I'm really quite optimistic about where things are and where they're 
headed on that front. I 
think they're headed to a good place.
 
Adam Michael Jonas 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne of 
Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.
 
Jeffrey Osborne 
-
 
Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Yeah. Go
od afternoon. Just two questions on my end. One, how do we think 
about the cadence of CapEx in 2017? Should it persist at a continued rate in 
the first half of 2017 up until the Model 3 launch at a similar run
-
rate as 
you're seeing here in Q4? Or what's th
e thought process there?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
You will see it ramp
-
up in Q1 and Q2 as you'd expect as we get closer to 
production, and then a lot of the payments come after start of productions in 
Q3, Q4. And there will be obviously expendi
tures on new vehicle 
development, so you can expect it to ramp
-
up a fair bit over time.
 
But I stand by what I said earlier which is, currently, if we did not go out and 
raised a bunch of money 

 
our current plan says we don't need to raise any 
money. It ge
ts a little scary in terms of how much capital we have in the 
bank relative to our sales volume, but at least currently raised capital is 
something that's nice to have, not a necessity. And maybe it's a smart move 
to de
-
risk things and all that.
 
So just lo
oking at the bigger picture, take into account also that we're 
designing the 3 program to be a cash generator 

 
that the faster the 3 
grows, the stronger our cash position. I don't think you need to worry too 
much about CapEx being, like, a dilutive event 
or something like that.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. And just so it's clear what Elon's talking about is a step
-
up from our 
Q3 levels, not a step
-
up from Q4.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jeffrey Osborne 
-
 
Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Do 
you care to throw a number out there for CapEx for 2017 at this point? 
Or do you think of it kind of flattish but front
-
end loaded on 2017 versus 
2016? Too early for that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

And then around CapEx as well, any thoughts on kind of partner 
commitments to Gigafactory? What's the 
trend there? And then also I might 
have missed it, but what's the reservation count for Model 3? I missed that 
in the release if it was there?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
We see very strong supplier commitments on Model 3. Yeah. We don't see 
any d
ips in supplier commitments there. They're very strong. This is the 
most interesting vehicle program, maybe the most interesting product 
program in the world, and so suppliers really want to be a part of something 
like this.
 
As for the 3 deposit number, th
is is not something we comment on and not 
something that is a figure of merit in any way. We do no promotion of Model 
3, we don't advertise 

 
we don't advertise in general 

 
but we don't 

 
like, 
how often do you see me mentioning a Model 3? I think people 
sometimes 
forget, like, that all we did for the Model 3 was half our webcast. There's no 
advertising, no guerrilla marketing campaign. We sent out a few tweets, like, 
hey, there's going to be a webcast. And there's like a lot of people decided 
they wanted 
to place a deposit for the car, which is cool. But we didn't want 
to get people too distracted from today's product in favor of tomorrow's 
product.
 
And then when somebody comes into our store to buy a Model 3, we say, 
well, why don't you buy Model S or an 
X instead? So we anti
-
sell the 3. Still 
a lot of people order to the 3, but whatever. Plus the 3, like, we basically 
sold out the first year of production, so the first 12 months production or 
thereabouts. So what's the point of trying to sell the 13th mon
th of 
production? Very little gain to be had there in doing so.

Thank you. And our next question com
es from the line of David Tamberrino 
of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
David Tamberrino

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Hi, thank you. Just want to circle back on a couple of things said earlier. 
First, on the Autopilot, you mentioned that you worked very clo
sely with 
NHTSA. I'm wondering what your take is on the push from the recent 
document, the Federal Autonomous Vehicle Policy (sic) [Federal Automated 
Vehicle Policy], that really is looking for data sharing among OEMs? I think 
you're probably clearly in th
e lead with vehicles on the road and miles per 
day of data that you're aggregating. I'm wondering what your take is on 
potentially opening that up and sharing with some of your competitors?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I mean, we'd be happy to 
share information with our competitors that would 
help improve safety. We'd be happy to do so.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Interesting. And then the second one is really just on the cost side. Do you 
think about a traditional OEM and their suppl
y relationships, there's typically 
annual price
-
downs ranging in the 1% to 3% range, sometimes more for 
commoditized products. And you're very vertically integrated. I wonder how 
you think about internal price
-
downs and gaining economies for scale on the 
M
odel 3 and what you're really looking to achieve from an operational 
efficiency standpoint on an annual basis with parts that you have going into 
your vehicles.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Model 3 efficiency as a whole, that really is a quantum ch
ange in 
productivity, like really, really, crazy. I mentioned this before, but as we go 
to high volumes, what really matters is the factory, the machine that designs 
the machine 

 
the machine that creates the machine is 

 
becomes actually 
of greater signif
icance, much greater significance than the machine itself. 
That's where we have most of our engineering team working on. So sort of 
an internal codename for the factory machine that builds machine is the 
alien dreadnought so a point in which our factory lo
oks like an alien 
dreadnought and we know it's probably right. So we think with Model 3, it 
will be alien dreadnought version 0.5 approximately, and then it will take us 
about another year or so, I don't know, summer 2018 to actually get to alien 
dreadnoug
ht version 1.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
And I'm a little bit hazy on quantifying crazy. Is there any rule of thumb that 
you can point to with what you're looking to achieve at least in terms of 
bringing the cost down from a component level fro
m the S to the 3, you 
know, not even thinking about the X, given the increasing complexity that 
was involved with the vehicle?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, in terms for (54:17) approximation, they seem to be about half.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Gol
dman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
That's not something like everything is half. Some things are way less than 
half the cost, and some things are more than half the cost, but on average, 
about half.
 
David Tamberrino 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
& Co.
 
And predominantly, internally sourced?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Well, it depends on how you consider the value chain but, yeah, I guess 
arguably it's 

 
the majority internally sourced but there's still a huge number 
of suppliers. The thi
ng that happens when you 

 
once you start making, 
almost all major sub
-
systems internally, your supplier count actually grows 
dramatically. You have far more suppliers, not far fewer. But they're at the 
component level not at the major sub
-
system level.
 
Ja
son S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. And just the one thing I'd add to that, too, regardless of sourcing 
(55:15) the supplier, the way to think about our costs and this goes all the 
way back to first principles, with the value decline is in the part w
here they 
cost reasonably turn those commodities into a usable part with reasonable 
labor and overhead, and that's how we think about all material cost 
decisions, internal or external.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. I mean, the long
-
term aspira
tion for the machine that builds the 
machine in the factory, alien dreadnaught thing, is the long
-
term aspiration 
is limited physics. I maybe call it, like, limited physics manufacturing.
 
Jeff Evanson

the next question.

Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Joseph Spak

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on leasing. I know you pointed out that 
the percent of vehicles that are subject to the RVG this period I think 
declined by four points and I don't know whether this was coincidental or not 
but it 
looks like the direct lease percentage also went up by about four 
points. So as you dwindle down the RVGs, are you planning that the ultimate 
lease rate is somewhere in that low
-
 
to mid
-
30% range?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
There's a bunch of di
fferent levers here, so one that's worth pointing out, 
and we haven't talked a lot about it, is we've put out some very compelling 
loan products in the marketplace.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Working with partners. Yeah.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla 
Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Network (57:05) partners.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. Through (57:06) partners. So, of course, we always want to continue 
to do that, and we're always looking for ways where we c
an provide 
compelling and useful financing programs for our consumers, whether that's 
a lease through a partner or whether that's a loan through a partner or 
whether we leverage our own balance sheet in the case of a direct lease, 
we'll do that too. Really
 
it's about the consumer experience. And if we can 
use other folks' capital for that, great. If we use our capital for it, that's fine 
too, and we're willing to make those decisions.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. And then just back on autonom
ous, maybe to ask Adam's question a 
little bit different way. I know you talked about a cross
-
country trip in 2017, 
but in terms of turning it on for the consumer, I think in the past you said 
you need about 6 billion miles travel for regulatory approval. 
If I just do 
some crude math, based on your delivery you've got timeline, it seems like 
at some point in 2018 you'll get there. Maybe it's a year or so later if you 
believe in consensus deliveries. But if you put aside the regulatory issues, is 
that roughl
y the timeframe you think it's ready for the consumer?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah. I think the timeframe that we think it's ready and then the timeframe 
that regulators will approve, because we've got to present the data to them. 
They've got
 
to think about it; then they've got to render a verdict. And that 
can sometimes be a long process and it varies 

 
and it vary quite a bit by 
jurisdiction. I think we may see some jurisdictions giving the okay a lot 
sooner than others. But when you think a
bout like the global average 
fatalities, it's sort of somewhere around 60, one fatality every 60 million 
miles on a global basis. So if you're at 6 billion miles, you're 100 times the 
fatalities per mile. I mean it'd be like 

 
yeah. So you really start to 
get quite 
statistically significant at that point, and it can make quite a strong 
argument, I believe, at that point that it would be morally wrong not to allow 
autonomous driving.

Thank you. I'll ask just one question. There was a reference to the Tesla 
network and the ability to buy self
-
driving today. So I wonder, Elon, if you 
could talk maybe philosophically about how you're viewing 
Tesla network. Is 
it something that will generate income for Tesla? Does it help develop future 
products, et cetera, at a reasonable gross margin? Or is it something that 
you'll use more for market share gain, help people offset the price of the car 
long

erm? Thanks.

(60:34).
 
Jason S. Wheeler

Okay. Go ahead.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
All right. Sorry. Just talking internally for a second there. I think it's a bit of 
both, really. This wou
ld be something that would be a significant offset on 
the cost of ownership of a car and then a revenue generator for Tesla as 
well. Obviously, the majority of the economics would go to the owner of the 
car. Sometimes, it's been characterized as Tesla vers
us Uber or Lyft or 
something like that. It's not Tesla versus Uber; it's the people versus Uber.

Hi. Thanks for including us in the call. I just wanted to get a little 
perspective on, I noticed in the s
hareholder letter the narrative kind of 
shifted. In Q2, you guys were saying that you're aiming toward volume 
production towards the end of 2017, but now the letter's saying you're 
looking for volume deliveries in the second half of 2017. Am I just reading
 
into this too much, or does that reflect a greater confidence on 
management's part or...?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think our confidence has been approximately the same. Obviously, as time 
goes by, there's some amount of the uncertainty is co
llapsed. And so, I 
guess you could kind of call that confidence, but it's 

 
yeah, it's looking good 
for production volume, second half of 2017. As always, I really want to 
remind people that a car is 

 
consists of several thousand unique items. We 
can only
 
go as fast as the slowest item. And so what we're trying to do in 
advance of 3 production is increase the scope of Tesla's internal capabilities 
so that we're internally capable of making almost anything. Kind of like 
reserve troops. You don't know exactl
y where they'll be needed, but it's a 
good idea to have them. And so that we can minimize the degree which a 
single supplier can stop the entire production line.
 
Daniel Sparks 
-
 
The Motley Fool
 
Okay. Great. And then as Model S and Model X, with higher leve
ls of sales 
recently, higher levels of deliveries, and as Model 3 approaches, do you feel 
confident in these levels as Model 3 approaches? I know that we haven't 
talked too much about 2017, but just kind of speaking as far as trajectory 
for those deliverie
s go, and how we could think about it?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Yeah, I mean, another thing I want to emphasize is when you 

 
the 
production ramp tends to look like 

 
it's exponential or ultimately it's an S
-
curve. Exponential goes to linear, a
nd then it goes to log. And it's very 
difficult to predict exactly where that beginning part of the exponential and 
the S
-
curve fits in between quarterly reporting. A shift of even a few weeks 
one way or the other can have quite a dramatic effect on what i
t looks like in 
that quarter, but that's not indicative of the future. So we're kind of telling 
you what 

 
we're giving you the best assessment we have, short of having a 
crystal ball. I think things will look very good exiting 2017, but it will be 
complic
ated and bumpy and dealing with a lot of unexpected issues in the 
beginning of Model 3 production in Q3, Q4, or Q3 particularly is very 
uncertain, because it's the beginning of an exponential. It gets pretty clearer 
in Q4, and then starts to be really cris
p in the Q1, Q2 timeframe of 2018.

Hi. 
Thanks for making time. I appreciate it. Just to go back to the capital 
issue, I hear you saying you don't need to raise capital this year. And I hear 
that you probably won't do it in the first quarter of next year. But what 
about next year in general? Sho
uld we look at that as a second half or a first 
half event? You want to raise capital in the first half of next year even if you 
don't need it?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
I think we cannot make 

 
it's actually I don't think it's legal for us to m
ake 
specific predictions of certainty with respect to doing an equity raise or 
something like that. So it's really exactly what I said before, which is our 
current projections, and this should probably be taken with a grain of salt. 
Current productions say
 
we don't need to go out and raise much equity. It 
could be unexpected negative things that occur. It could be some global 
macroeconomic slowdown. It could be, who knows what could happen. And 
so, there may be value in de
-
risking the business and just havi
ng higher 
capital reserves. We're not ready to make that decision yet.

Hi, Elon. Quick question, in your shareholder letter, you guys mentioned that 
you're continuing to explore possibilities for expanding production to Asia 
and Europe. As you start to look at the production ramp and expanding your 
facilities in Fr
emont, do you have a timeframe for when you might make a 
decision in terms of, I think, this is one we'll probably make some decision 
about another production facility, whether it's in China, whether it's in 
Europe, wherever it might be, somewhere beyond F
remont?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
Right now, we're really focused on Gigafactory 1 and Model 3, spending very 
little time on facilities outside of Fremont, California and Sparks, Nevada. So 
it's really hard to say, at this point, except to say i
t's pretty obvious that 
long
-
term you want to have your production close to your consumption, so 
you don't have massive logistics costs, transporting cars halfway around the 
world. And 

 
yeah. So that's 

 
I think we're probably not ready to talk about 
that
 
now, and we just don't have a fully formed idea now. We'll probably end 
up talking about that next year.

11/4/11,Tesla,"Thank you. First of all, I'd like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional 
execution in the second quarter despite tremendous difficulties. They've 
done an incredible job, and it's an honor to work with such a great team. I 
mean, there were so many 
challenges, too numerous to name, but they got 
it done, and just what a great group to work with, like I said, it's just an 
honor to work with such a great team.
 
And as a result, we were able to achieve our fourth consecutive profitable 
quarter, and althou
gh the automotive industry was down about 30% year
-
over
-
year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the 
first half of the year. So despite that massive industry decline, we actually 
went up.
 
We're also very excited to announce that
 
we're going to be building our next 
Gigafactory in Texas. It's going to be right near Austin. It will be about 
--
 
I'll 
just go into a bit of detail on this, and then I'm sure there'll be a lot of 
questions. But the location is five minutes from Austin Int
ernational Airport 
and 15 minutes from Downtown Austin, and it's about 2,000 acres, and 
we're going to make it a factory that is going to be stunning. It's right on the 
Colorado River. So we're actually going to have a boardwalk where there'll a 
hiking and
 
biking trail. It's going to basically be an ecological paradise. Birds 
in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public 
as well. So not closed and only Tesla.
 
So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engine
ering, 
production, whatever the case may be, please let us know. This is 
--
 
we're 
going to be doing a major factory there. And it's also where we'll be doing 
Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi. And we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the 
eastern half of North A
merica.
 
Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California. 
But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 
3 and Y for the western half of North America. And then we think probably 
also the Tesla Roadste
r, a future program, would also make sense in 
California.
 
So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California. And just to 
emphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a 
massive factory and Cybertruck and Semi programs in
 
Texas.
 
And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very 
much to the Tulsa team, the economic development team and the governor, 
really, I was super impressed. The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and 
we will, for sure, stro
ngly consider Tulsa for future expansion of Tesla down 
the road.
 
Let's see, is there anything more I want to say about? There's a lot of 
information. So anything, guys? All right. Well, I'm sure they have lots of 
questions. We've already started work on th
e facility, so some initial 
construction work. So it's already underway, started this weekend.
 
Let's see, moving on to other subjects, Solar. We recently adjusted the 
pricing of our retrofit solar. So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar in the 
United Stat
es. And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money
-
back 
guarantee. So we're very confident that people will have our solar product, 
whether it's the Solar Retrofit or Solar Roof.
 
Our Solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the Federal Tax
 
Credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per watt. And it's very simple, highly 
automated single
-
click experience. So definitely, think about Tesla, whether 
you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want Solar on your existing 
roof either way, we're the c
ompany to go to. And then you also get a 
Powerwall and have energy independence and be your own utility. So I think 
that product is really coming together and it's only going to get better later 
this year. So just very excited about that business potential
.
 
On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car 
with more than 400 miles range. So the current Tesla Model S now has an 
EPA
-
certified range of 402 miles. I mean, you basically can drive from L.A. 
to San Francisco nonstop and st
ill have some miles left over when you 
arrive. And this is at highway speed. So you don't have to anything drive 
slowly or anything drive 
--
 
you can just drive normally and go very long 
distances.
 
And then for full self
-
driving, we launched traffic lights 
and stop signs and 
we continue to improve that to make them more robust. And we're currently 
testing full self
-
driving software for intersections and city streets and narrow 
streets. So I personally tested the latest Alpha build of the full self
-
driving 
so
ftware when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better than 
people realize. Yes, really profound. It's like amazing.
 
So it's almost getting to a point where I can go from my house to work with 
no interventions, despite going through const
ruction and widely varying 
situations. So this is why I'm very confident about full self
-
driving 
functionality being complete by the end of this year. It's because I'm literally 
driving it.
 
In conclusion, I'd like to again say thanks for all the hard
-
work 
of the Tesla 
team, achieving our first full year of profitability in the company history. It 
was incredibly difficult. And just as a result of the hard
-
work of a lot of 
people from Tesla worldwide.
 
And yes, just think about the next 12 to 18 months, we'll 
have 3 new 
factories in place. Things are looking great with Giga Berlin, and we'll have 
Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Full Self
-
Driving. There's so much to be excited 
about. It's really hard to kind of fit into this call.
 
But the sheer amount of hardcore en
gineering, especially on the autonomy 
and the manufacturing engineering front is mind blowing. And then, of 
course, there's Factory Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I think 
that's really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.
 
So
 
with that, thanks, again, for your support on our long
-
term mission. And 
we're looking forward to having a great journey with you, to create amazing 
products and continue scaling it. And, yes, this is 
--
 
I think, I've never been 
more optimistic or excited
 
about the future of Tesla and the history of the 
company. Thank you.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. And I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some 
remarks as well.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. Thanks, Martin. I want to start by thanking our 
employees, customers 
and suppliers for your support over the last quarter. In particular to the 
Tesla team, I couldn't be more impressed with the hard work and the 
resiliency that you all have shown.
 
On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved o
ur fourth 
sequential quarter of profitability. This is despite a significant impact to our 
financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and field 
operations around the world. To ensure the business remains healthy, we 
took temporary
 
action to reduce costs, including expenses related to 
personnel and non
-
critical patent projects.
 
The direct cost savings 
--
 
or the direct cost impact of the temporary 
shutdown was largely offset by these cost savings actions. Although, the 
cost were conc
entrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS 
and operating expenses.
 
On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced 
sequentially from 20% to 18.7%. This sequential reduction is fully attributed 
to idle capacity charge
s and lower operational efficiency, due to the various 
shutdowns. Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing 
our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and Model 3 in Shanghai. 
Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the deci
sion in Q2 to 
pass
-
through savings to customers around the world on some of our 
products.
 
With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we 
recognized $48 million of deferred revenue in the period. The full profit 
impact on our P&L i
s less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD 
computer retrofits in the field.
 
Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million. While 
difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is 
roughly double 
that of 2019. Services and other margin improved yet again, 
marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
 
In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly 
profit. We remain production
-
constrained in this business and are con
tinuing 
to work towards building additional capacity. And our solar installation 
business was impacted by permit office closures, limiting installation volume.
 
Stock
-
based comp increased from Q1 to Q2. This is driven almost entirely by 
an expense related t
o the next tranche of the CEO grant, as well as early 
vesting of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&A within operating 
expenses.
 
On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 
billion, which included free cash 
flows of over $400 million. This is a strong 
result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with 
Shanghai and Berlin, as well as movements in working capital.
 
A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables
. 
While our AR balance is usually about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate 
depending upon a number of factors. First, overall, less than 30% of our 
receivables is associated with new car sales.
 
Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enter
prise 
customers, settlement time lines for certain methods of cash payments and 
geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated 
receivables are impacted significantly by how many cars are delivered in the 
final weeks and days of the quart
er.
 
Third, roughly 40% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on 
regulatory credit sales and statutory EV incentive programs, both of which 
have been increasing. Customer deposits reduced slightly as well. Note that 
as we transition to lower order f
ees across the world, the average deposit 
per order will continue to reduce driving down this balance.
 
As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile 
and dynamic culture. We will continue to appropriately manage our cash 
flows t
hrough cost optimization and close working capital management. This 
is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations 
and preparing for the launch of three new factories over the next 1.5 years.
 
Question

and
-
Answer Session
 
A 
-
 
Mar
tin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. Let's go to questions from institutional investors first. 
The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long
-
term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important 
vehicle progra
ms that will drive volume growth over the next three to five 
years beyond Model 3, Y and the Cybertruck? Cheaper, smaller versions of 3 
and Y? Or region
-
specific vehicles? Or anything else?
 
Elon Musk
 
I don't think we can comment on our detailed product roa
dmap beyond 
what's announced because I think we want to reserve that for product 
launches. But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a 
compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity [indiscernible] 
vehicle of some kind. These are
 
likely things at some point. But I do think 
there's a long way to go with 3 and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi. So it's 
a long way to go with those. I think we'll do the obvious things.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. The second question from institutional is, what i
s your vision for 
software at Tesla? What opportunities do you see from monetizing the 
installed base other than by FSD?
 
Elon Musk
 
Right now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I 
think the upgrading of the fleet to full
-
self drivi
ng, especially with an over
-
the
-
air software update. I mean, we go down as the biggest asset value 
increase in history as a step change.
 
Maybe there's something bigger, but it certainly would be one of the biggest 
--
 
I can't think of anything bigger. So ov
ernight, 1 million 
--
 
depending on 
exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory 
jurisdictions, you have like at least a few million cars, suddenly becoming 
five times more valuable or something like that.
 
Certainly five times high
er utility. They go from like 12 hours a week of 
utility, something like that or [indiscernible] to 60, something like that.
 
So, everything else is pretty small by comparison. Now, when things do 
become full self
-
driving, so what are we going to do in the 
car? Well, I guess 
we're probably going want to do productivity and entertainment of some 
kind. Or maybe play games and do work. That's in the future. We're already 
putting some games and stuff on the car, just for fun.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes, we have been e
xperimenting on that. So, FSD remains, by far and 
away, the biggest opportunity in the near
-
term. But we're putting the 
plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the time is right. 
So, premium connectivity subscription is something that we've
 
put in place.
 
And the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on 
Acceleration Boost or upgrading a Standard Range Model 3 to a Standard 
Plus, adding rear
-
heated seats. So, these are things that we have and we're 
continuing to get fee
dback from the field and other things that we can 
launch and we'll trickle those in with time.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to full self
-
driving depending upon how you calculate it is probably worth at least 
$
100,000 per car. So, it's a lot of software you have to sell in the App Store 
or whatever, yes.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. The third question is also about Autopilot. What are the most 
important upcoming self
-
driving milestones? And how do you think about 
ti
ming?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, the actual major milestone that's happening right now is really a 
transition of the autonomy system of the cars like AI, if you will, from 
thinking about things in 
--
 
like two and a half feet. It's like think 
--
 
things 
like isolated p
ictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are 
[partially] [ph] correlated in time, but not very well and transitioning to kind 
of a 4D where it's like 
--
 
which is video essentially. You're thinking about the 
world in three dimensions and the fou
rth dimension being time.
 
So, that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but 
has not really been rolled out to anyone in the production fleet, is what 
really matters for full self
-
driving.
 
So, what we've been doing, thus far, is reall
y just things like 2D 
--
 
mostly 
2D and like I said, not well correlated in time. So, just hard to convey just 
how much better a fully 4D system would work 
--
 
does work. It's capable of 
things that if you just look 
--
 
looking at things as individual picture
s as 
opposed to video 
--
 
basically, like you could go from like individual pictures 
to surround video. So, it's fundamental.
 
So, the car will seem to have just like a giant improvement. [Indiscernible] 
probably rolling out later this year. We'll be 
able to do traffic lights, stop, 
turns, [trust] [ph], everything, pretty much. And then it will be a long march 
of nines, essentially. How many nines of reliability are okay. So it's definitely 
way better than human, but how much better than human does nee
d to be.
 
So that's actually going to be the real work. There's just a massive amount 
of work with each, kind of, order of magnitude of reliability. But you'll see it 
happen. And if you plot the points on the curve, it would be kind of [up
-
ish[ ph]] where i
t's headed.
 
AI, in general, I think, is something 
--
 
I've been saying this, banging this AI 
drum for a decade, we should be concerned about where AI is going. The 
people I see being the most [wrong] [ph] about AI are the ones who are 
very smart, because th
ey can't imagine that a computer could be way 
smarter than them. That's the flaw in their logic. They're just way dumber 
than they think they are.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. And the next question from institutional investors is. Please, may 
you update us on 
Alien Dreadnought? How has your thinking evolved and 
what is needed in order to get closer to fundamental physical limits?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, we bring a massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, 
the machine that makes the machine. There's proba
bly 1,000%, maybe 
10,000% more engineering required for the factory then for the product 
itself. So we're certainly making progress. I mean, battery and powertrain 
factory, Gigafactory in Nevada is, you know, alien dreadnought version 0.5, 
something like t
hat, starting to approach version 1.
 
We're getting way better at making cars. You can see that in Giga Shanghai. 
You'll see that even more with Berlin. And we're really changing the design 
of the car in order to make it more manufacturable. The fundamental
 
architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin, it may look the same, but 
the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient 
architecturally than what we've done to date.
 
Drew, would you like to add to that?
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes. I wa
s going to expand on that. I think part of the Alien Dreadnought 
concept is not just automation, but minimizing the number of process steps 
and complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really 
integrating design and manufacturing acro
ss from like when the raw 
materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit. And we're learning so 
much through doing that.
 
Elon Musk
 
Vertical integration is extremely important to this. But the supply chain, if 
you put like a GPS tracker on a molecul
e from when it got mined to when it 
was in a usable product, it would look insane.
 
It would be like, wow, it went around the world like six times. So with 
vertical integration, maybe you can only go around the world once. It would 
be a huge improvement, or
 
not even like half 
--
 
I think, I get vertical 
integration in litigation an order of magnitude improvement. So yes. And its 
--
 
do you want to Drew...
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes. I think the focus for us is increasing CapEx efficiency. This is something 
that we've be
en working very hard for the past 3 years. And you can see 
that we can build new factories for less amount of money and much faster. 
Those things go together.
 
Elon Musk
 
It's a better factory for less money in less time.
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes. Less money means l
ess time. So that's a great advantage. And also 
reducing this 
--
 
and there still is a lot, the amount of inefficiencies. We want 
every operation to add value to the vehicle; value, meaning moving the 
atoms closer to the final state. So we do not want any r
obot that just moves 
things.
 
Elon Musk
 
Or in fact, it's like we want to be super respectful of people's labor. If we're 
asking somebody to do something, are we sure it's useful? Are we asking 
them to spend their timing a way that is respectful of their tim
e? But it's 
like, wow, the like, the potential for improvement is tremendous. But it's I 
just want to be clear. At Tesla, we love manufacturing. It's awesome. And I 
really think more smart people should be working on manufacturing.
 
Drew Baglino
 
We want mor

designing new lines and trying to do things different, Tesla's got a job for 
you. And now we've got jobs everywhere. It's not only in California. Now 
we've got just in China, in Berlin, in Aus
tin, Texas and in California. So 
there's plenty of exciting places. And all these places will do original work 
and challenging meaningful work.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Absolutely. It's actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new 
production systems. And
 
I think that for some reason, I kind of got a bad 
rep, especially in the U.S. for a long time. And I think people didn't think 
that manufactured 
--
 
they sort of put manufacturing is like, oh, this is for 
some boring, just making copies, whatever.
 
But actu
ally, there's far more opportunity for innovation in manufacturing 
than in the products itself, order magnitude. So like if there's one thing that 
comes out of this call, it's like, hey, if you want to help us invent amazing, 
new manufacturing techniques a
nd have input into the product itself, it's not 
like you just get touch the product and say, hey, make this product and it's 
kind of a lousy design.
 
If you're manufacturing, you get to change the product design, and say, 
hey, this product, you're asking yo
ur manufacturers dumb. Like, great, let's 
fix it. So it has, if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don't just 
get force fed a sandwich. You get to change the product design. So it's super 
exciting. And we evolve the lines even after they're bot
h this rapid evolution 

 
Drew Baglino
 
And there's nothing more rewarding than going from 0 cars an hour to 5,000 
cars a week or 1,000 cars a day.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. So the long
-
term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be 
manufacturing.
 
Martin Viecha
 
And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can 
Tesla produce in Texas?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, right now, 0. But long term, a lot.
 
Drew Baglino
 
It's our biggest property.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes, it's biggest propert
y, true.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Okay. And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com. The 
first one is, Tesla Energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite Elon 
comments about growth rate exceeding automotive. Could Tesla share more 
detail on ca
lendar planned projects to help investors better understand the 
business outlook? How disruptive is Tesla's Autobidder technology?
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I can't emphasize. I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the 
same size as Tesla Automotive. So, I me
an, the Energy business collectively 
is bigger than the automotive business. So you feel like, how big is the 
Energy sector? Bigger than automotive.
 
And in order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have 
sustainable energy generation, which I
 
think is going to be primarily solar 
and followed by wind. And those are intermittent.
 
So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the solar energy, because the 
wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine. So there's like 
three elements 
of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable 
energy generation; battery storage; and electric transport, those three 
things.
 
And the mission of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy. So I can't 
emphasize enough. Yes. The battery and sol
ar will both be enormous. And 
they kind of have to be in order to 
--
 
for us to have a sustainable future. And 
we've got a great product road map on that front as well. So we're going to 
ship in the Megapack. It's very well received. Drew, you want to talk 
about 
that?
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes. I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly 
deployable grid tied storage battery of megawatt hour scale. We're working 
with utilities, large and small, not just utilities, but also just like microg
rid 
and project developers of all type, and building our own projects where it 
makes sense.
 
And there's a lot of demand for the product, and we're growing the 
production rates as fast as we can for that product. And then on Autobidder, 
Autobidder is basica
lly autopilot for grid
-
type batteries. It's an autonomous 
energy market participation system that does high
-
frequency trading in 
short...
 
Elon Musk
 
That's a bad word.
 
Drew Baglino
 
Sorry.
 
Elon Musk
 
How should free instant energy called front running. We're 
not doing that.
 
Drew Baglino
 
Not doing anything like that. No, it's ensuring that the battery is doing 
everything it can to manage the grid intermittency of the renewals 
--
 
renewables and just grid intermittency of all kinds. I mean, people turn their 
lights on and off, power plants turn on and off, factories ramp up and down 
and batteries are great to solve those problems.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Its just grid stabilization at the most heightened level. So it just shows 
that things are super smooth. It's like a
 
UPS, uninterruptible power supply of 
a normal size. But just ensure that this grid has smooth sailing. And then the 
batteries, the computers like all interact with each other and make sure that 
they're working together to make the grid smooth. And this ca
n be done 
with the Powerwalls and the Megapacks and the Powerpacks all working 
together and interacting with third
-
party systems as well.
 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes. Essentially, are distributed. It does both.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes.
 
Drew Baglino
 

 
Elon Mus
k
 

 
Drew Baglino
 
Yes, you can't plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world. 
You need to optimize them on a minute
-
by
-
minute scale, and that's what 
we're doing.
 
Elon Musk
 
Ye
s. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. 
That's the real limit. So that's why we're going to talk about a lot more 
about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint. 
And any part of that supply
 
chain or pricing at the cell level will be the 
limiting factor.
 
So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that 
are refining to cathode and analog formation, cell formation, whatever the 
truck point is, that will set the growth r
ate. And so we expect to expand our 
business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others. And 
there's a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. And the second question is, now that it's time to bring the Tesla 
Se
mi to volume production, can you share more detail on production plans? 
What weekly production rate is considered volume production? And when 
does Tesla expect to reach that rate?
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. So we'll start production next year, as we 
announced it before. I'm 
personally very excited about the project. I can't wait. We do have a few 
trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars. But we're 
going to accelerate that.
 
I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use o
urselves, Tesla to 
carry our own freight, probably mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is 
a fantastic test route. We're going to prove that we have very good 
reliability. And so far, the early units do have it, but we'll do that at a larger 
scale. And w
e have also promised some early units to some long term, very 
patient and supportive customers, and we'll do that.
 
Now we have more sales coming up in next year, as Elon just pointed out. 
So we can increase the diversity of the portfolio. It didn't make se
nse up to 
now to do it. But we'll be ready. And that's maybe a little biased. I'm very 
excited about this. And we have a lot of very unique technology that we're 
always dreaming about that we will be putting into that Semi. It will be just 
awesome. Yes.
 
El
on Musk
 

and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density 
so longer range. Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, 
where every, every un
it of mass that you add in battery pack you have to 
subtract in cargo. So it's very important to have a mass efficient and long 
range pack for four batteries. What we're seeing with our passenger vehicles 
is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficien
cy, drive coefficient like 
basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat 
pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with 
Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron 
phosphate 
battery pack in Model 3 in China and that that'll be in volume 
production later this year. So, we think that getting a range that is in the 
high 200 
--
 
basically, we think you probably getting a range of almost 300 
miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking
 
into account a whole bunch of 
powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies.
 
And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the 
other projects so far higher energy density. So, yes, so you have like two 
supply chains that you can tap i
nto iron phosphate or nickel. We use very 
little cobalt in our system already and that's 
--
 
that may to zero along, so it's 
basically about nickel.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce 
Standard 3 Range versio
n of Model Y. No longer offers a Standard Range 
Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi. Does this shift from 
smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the 
past? What are the biggest constraints now?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please 
mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more 
nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long 
--
 
some high point 
that you experienced some five ye
ars ago or whatever, go for efficiency. As 
environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.
 
Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine 
nickel efficiently and in an environmentally
-
sensitive way. So, hopefully, this 
me
ssage goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.
 
With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for Range is going 
to be just in U.S. EPA terms approximately 300 miles. So, I think people will 
really come to expect that as some number 
close to 300 miles as normal. 
That's a standard expectation because you do need to take into account, 
like, is it very hot outside or very cold? Or are you driving up into a 
mountain with a full load? And it's 
--
 
people don't want to have 
--
 
get to the 
des
tination with like 10 miles range, they want some reasonable margins.
 
So, I think 300 is going to be really 
--
 
or close to 300 is going to be a new 
normal. Call it 500 kilometers basically 
--
 
roughly.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you. Next question on insurance. Wh
at is the hold up for Tesla 
Insurance outside of California? Will you release numbers from that part of 
the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the Tesla ride 
hailing network as a driver?
 
Elon Musk
 
Sure.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. We we
re joking before the call that we get the quarterly insurance 
question that 
--
 
funsay.com [ph] here. We are working super hard on 
insurance. I'll go into a little bit more deal here than I have in the past.
 
Currently, we have a product in California, as I'
ve described before, it's been 
quite well received and I would largely describe it as a fairly standard 
insurance product with elements of it that are unique to our cars. So you can 

 
Elon Musk
 
Version 0.9 is 
it getting at least.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
0.9. What we're working on now is 
--
 
we can call it version two, or we can 
call it the first version of our Telematics product. And so really ultimately 
where we want to get to with Tesla Insurance is to be able to use
 
the data 
that's captured in the car, in the driving profile of the person in the car, to 
be able to assess correlations and probabilities of crash and be able then to 
assess a premium on a monthly basis for that customer.
 
And what makes this very exciting
 
for us is the amount of data that is 
available, with the customer's permission to use, is not available on any 
other product or any other vehicle in the world. So this gives us a unique 
advantage in terms of information.
 
And we have a decision point here 
where we could take the California 
product and replicate that into other states, or we could delay going into 
additional states and instead put more effort into the Telematics side of this. 
And we chose the latter.
 
And where we are now is nearly complete w
ith the risk and cost analysis 
associated with the first version of the Telematics product. We hope to be 
filing that in a handful of states with regulators very shortly. And assuming 
that regulatory approvals go smoothly, we hope to have this in a handful
 
of 
states by the end of the year.
 
And then we'll continue to file for approval in additional states. With 
regulatory approval there, we'll continue to roll this out nationwide as 
quickly as we can. And then that product, as we continue to collect more 
dat
a and reiterate on it, there'll be version two, version three, et cetera, as 
we continue to refine that.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean, at the heart of being competitive with insurance is what is the 
accuracy of your information. Like are you dealing with 
--
 
are y
ou forced to 
assess people statistically looking in the rear
-
view mirror Or can you assess 
people individually, looking ahead with smart projections, and inform the 
driver that 
--
 
how they may reduce their 
--
 
what actions they can take to 
reduce their insu
rance, as Zach was alluding to, it's like, okay, you're driving 
too fast, you're on this that, the other thing, it's like if you want to pay more 
for insurance, you can. But if you want to pay less, then please don't drive 
so crazy.
 
Then people can make a 
choice. Like, okay, they want to drive aggressively, 
in the case, it'll be higher insurance, or they want more capital enter driving 
and pay less. This was actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to 
see what is driving insurance expense. A lot
 
of it is just 
--
 
it's like a little 
fender bender and the net fender bender because of the way that the body 
collision repair is being done, it cost like $15,000 or something crazy, and 
like, and then we can actually adjust the design of the car and adjus
t how 
the repair is done to actually have the fundamental cost of solving that 
problem would be less.
 
So this has helped us under a whole bunch of facility things that we were 
doing basically without realizing it. But this is a problem with, in general, 
wi
th insurance is like if the insurance is like, all you can eat, then the 
feedback loop for improvement is sweet.
 
So this gives us a great feedback for improvement, because it's basically a 
fundamentally better insurance product. I'd also like to say, I'm i
nspired of 
recruiting because if there's one thing I'd like to come out of this call, it's 
that a lot of great people want to join Tesla. That's the other one thing I'd 
like to take on this call.
 
And on the insurance front, I want to be clear. We're buildi
ng a great, like a 
major insurance company. If you're interested in revolutionary insurance, 
please join Tesla. I would love to have some high energy actuaries, 
especially. I have great respect for the actuarial profession. Your guys are 
great at math, ple
ase join Tesla. Especially if you want to change things and 
you're annoyed by how slow the industry is. This is the place to be. We want 
revolutionary actuaries.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Sorry. So there was the second part of 
this question, will Tesla Insurance be 
required to participate in the Tesla ride
-
hailing network? And so, I think I've 
answered this before in prior calls, but by the time the ride
-
hailing network 
is available, we will 
--
 
Tesla Insurance coverage will be p
rovided to folks who 
are in this network.
 
It's a different type of insurance because of the use of the car. It's not 
decided whether third
-
party insurance versus Tesla Insurance will be 
required. There might be some things we need to think through there. B
ut 
Tesla Insurance, at least, will be working, working for the ride
-
hailing 
network.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. And in the interest of time lets go to the Q&A of 
analyst from the line.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question will come from Dan Levy 
with Credit Suisse. 
Please go ahead.
 
Dan Levy
 
Hi good afternoon. Thank you. I'll ask a question on quarter and then just a 
question more broadly on strategy. Just on the quarter, if you could give us 
an update on gross margin. Was China accretive to gross 
margin in the 
second quarter? And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was 
versus Fremont Model 3?
 
And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in
-
sourcing is varying by region. You're in
-
sourcing a lot more in Fremont,
 
but 
you're relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai. What do you 
expect your approach to be on in
-
sourcing when you eventually open up 
Berlin? And what your Texas factory is going to be? Thank you.
 
Zachary Kirkhorn
 
Yes. Just to start with the gr
oss margin questions. We did see progress on 
gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken. 
The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp. So 
we think there's think there's a continued opportunit
y to optimize the cost 
structure there.
 
Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of 
production. And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, 
we did see pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margi
n. And as we 
said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will 
converge. They're not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive 
than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production. And with Model Y carrying a 
slightly higher 
price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the 
relative gross margins.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. And it's continuing 
to do more and more internally. But it's also 
--
 
the thing that's really helping 
is
 
like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of 
the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
 
And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to 
the cost of the vehicle. And I 
mean, the proportion of local sourcing has 
literally been rising at like 5% to 10% a month, from 40 
--
 
it was like 40% 
at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like 80% by the end 
of this year, maybe more.
 
Zach Kirkhorn
 
There is also a l
ot 
--
 
very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers 
around the factory in China.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I will say it like this. The suppliers in China have been extremely 
competitive, possibly the most competitive in the world.
 
Zach Kirkhorn
 
And so far, we
're in negotiations with 
--
 
for Berlin and we've awarded a lot 
of business. Also a lot of suppliers in Germany or the rest of Europe that are 
eager to support the factory in Berlin. Yes.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. Well, obviously, Germany has a great automotive indust
ry and supply 
chain. So, actually, a ton of our suppliers are in Germany within like a few 
hundred kilometers of the factory.
 
Martin Viecha
 

 
Operator
 
Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi
 
with Bernstein. Please go 
ahead.
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Yes. Thank you. You mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times that you 
were pleased with gross margin with PTI margin progress and you expect it 
to achieve industry
-
leading operating margins over time. Maybe you could 
shed a little light on that?
 
Indus
try
-
leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI. For Porsche, it's 
smaller, at 17%. For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%. What do we think 
about? And how much, ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will 
contribute to that margin? Because I know your
 
margin has been 5% over 

a 4 point contribution right now. How do we think about ultimately what 
industry
-
leading margins are? And how much of that you think is coming 
from EV
 
credits, regulatory credits? And I have a follow
-
up, please.
 
Zach Kirkhorn
 
Sure. I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit. We manage 
the business, said differently, we don't manage the business with the 
assumption that regulatory credits w
ill contribute in a significant way to the 
future. I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to 
2019, and it will continue for some period of time, but eventually, the 
stream of regulatory credits will reduce.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. I mean, 
it's worth telling that we're 
--
 
buyers of our car in the U.S. 
received 0 federal tax credit. Whereas many of our competitors are like, they 
get a $7,500 pack tax credit. And yet our sales have continued to do well. 
Yes.
 
Zach Kirkhorn
 
Yes. And so what we s
ee is a continued decline in the cost to produce 
manufacturing and distribute our cars. That cost curve, even for mature 
products, like the S and the X, continues to come down as we work on that. 
Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that conti
nues to come 
down.
 
You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential 
for software
-
based revenue, particularly full self
-
driving, there's the revenue 
recognition portion of that, that we have today, that, that will expand as we 
re
lease more features. And then you can layer on top of that, in the future, 
revenue from a ride
-
hail network.
 
Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a 
percentage of revenue. There's still incredible opportunity there that we 
w
ere working on, particularly on how customers interact with the company 
from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them.
 
So we continue to see efficiencies there. So in the medium term here, what 
our modeling shows is in the low t
eens operating margin level. And I think 
there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up. So I hear your 
point on the 5% and the 1%. We're on a bit of a journey here, and we're 
continuing to be partner [ph].
 
Toni Sacconaghi
 
Thank you. And if I co
uld just follow
-
up, Elon, you've talked a lot about the 
mission of the company in 
--
 
and really trying to drive EV adoption globally. 
So how do you think about that trade
-
off between driving towards industry
-
leading profitability, yet trying to make your c
ars more affordable and 
broader? It feels like, historically, you've always picked the path of, I'd 
rather drive more growth and more adoption because ultimately, that's the 
mission of the company, and we even saw it a little bit this quarter with 
price re
ductions, you could have probably kept price where it is, sold some 
units and had better profits, but that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as 
a company has made. So how do you personally think about that trade
-
off 
between, even if you were to get to i
ndustry
-
leading margins, wouldn't you 
be inclined to give more of that back to drive a greater adoption more 
quickly?
 
Elon Musk
 
Well, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy. I think 
we can go way beyond industry margins and have the 
car be affordable to 
more and more people and potentially almost everyone when you're 
factoring in autonomy. But that was really a mega game changer, giga game 
changer.
 
Yes. But I mean, it is important for people to distinguish between two things. 
There's 
value for money that our product has; and then there's affordability. 
And even if you rail value for money and have value for money, like infinite, 
if people don't have enough 
--
 
if people do not have enough money in their 
bank account to buy the car, they
 
simply cannot.
 
So then you used to have this cycle or something that nobody can buy. So it 
is important to make the car affordable, and we will not succeed in our 
mission if we do not make cars affordable.
 
Like the thing that bugs me the most about where 
we are right now is that 
our cars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we're all making 
progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress. So yes, we 
need to not go bankrupt. Obviously, that's important because that will fail in
 
our mission. But we're not trying to be super profitable either, obviously, 
profitability is like 1% or something, this 1% or 2%.
 
It's not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be 
profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slight
ly profitable and 
maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that's 
what we're trying to achieve.
 
Martin Viecha
 

 
Operator
 
Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche 
Bank. 
Please go ahead.
 
Emmanuel Rosner
 
Hi, good afternoon. Could you please characterize the current near
-
term 
demand environment for your vehicles? These are obviously unusual times. I 
think back in Q1, you had indicated record backlog, I guess, at the be
ginning 
of this past quarter. I haven't seen any specific comments about new orders 
or backlog in the release today. So, can you give us some color?
 
Elon Musk
 
Demand is not a problem. Definitely not. We do have some production 
supply chain challenges we're
 
trying to slow right now. For example, the 
Model Y, we're body casting, obviously, because it's new technology, it's 
been tricky to maintain rates and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting, 
which is 
--
 
it's a two
-
piece casting with a bunch 
--
 
and ther
e's about half 
dozen other parts that are added on, that will transition to a one
-
piece 
casting.
 
In fact, I'm super excited about this. We're going to have a 
--
 
the world's 
biggest casting press is getting assembled right now actually in Fremont for 
the 
Model Y rear body casting. It's enormous and looks awesome. So, it's 
--
 
look, the things that are troubling us right now are not demand, that they 
are just a bunch of firefighting on supply chain and production issues.
 
Emmanuel Rosner
 
Okay. So 
--
 
Elon Musk
 
Sorry. Yes. Don't worry about demand. That's not the issue.
 
Emmanuel Rosner
 
Okay. So, when you're saying achieving 500,000 deliveries has become 
more difficult, was it really just a function of the recent shutdowns and some 
of these supply dynamics?
 
Elon 
Musk
 
Yes. It's not true at demand. It's really just a production issue. It's been 
pretty hard when you've got like a global supply chain, and it's kind of 
whatever the most effective part of supply chain is that sets your rate.
 
I mean the number of rabbits
 
do know how to pull out of a hat for supply 
chain is insane, team has done an amazing job. So, I think also some of our 
costs were related to having to use a lot of airplanes to get parts around 
because of part shortages. So, we'll hopefully use fewer air
planes. That will 
improve our costs, but demand exceeds supply right now. That's where we 
are now.
 
Martin Viecha
 
Thank you very much. And the last question please.
 
Operator
 
Our last question today will come from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. 
Please go ahead.
 
Philippe Houchois
 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. You mentioned a few times the constraint 
to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the 
scope of the Berlin plans for building right now. Will there be the batt
ery 
capacity consistence with the amount of assembly volume you expect to 
come out of the 
--
 
?
 
And if not, would you be able to source, your battery requirements, out of 
Europe? Or would you have to import batteries from outside Europe to 
ensure production
 
in Berlin?
 
Elon Musk
 
Okay. We can't say too much about this. Except that, where there will be 
local cell production and 
--
 
that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory. 
Drew, is there anything? Berlin factory. Drew, is there anything 
--
 
yes?
 
Drew Bagli
no
 
I mean, no, that's straightforward enough. I think just adding to what you 
said earlier about talent and people, like the same goes in all areas of cell, 
supply chain, manufacturing materials, design, we are solving this problem. 
And we 
--
 
we're treatin
g it like any other problem that we have solved. We 
will solve this problem, talented people to join us as we solve this problem.
 
Elon Musk
 
Yes. And like, so my biggest concern for getting our talented people is just 
probably Berlin, because the labor mobi
lity in Europe is not as low. I would 
recommend changing this. Like somebody wants to leave and join another 
company, sometimes they have to spend six months on Garden Leave. It's 
called garden, hanging out in the garden, basically. And like this is not a 
good use of people's time. I mean, if they want us to hang out on the 
garden, that's fine, but they shouldn't have to.

8/4/11,Tesla,"Sure. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everybody, for joining. I just wanted to 
make a few brief comments to add a little bit more color to this shareholder 
letter.
 
We're clearly disappointed with our delivery numbers, but there's some 
underlying stories 
that we feel really good about and I'm going to walk you 
through those briefly. First, automotive gross margin expanded this quarter. 
Automotive gross margin excluding ZEV credits grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 
21.2% in Q2. A couple of different factors here. On
e was the Model S 
refresh. There was a modest price increase on the refresh but, more 
importantly, we had a baked a number of cost
-
downs into that vehicle 
before the launch. And then the second big factor is obviously X production. 
We talked a lot about ho
w we have come through the struggles on that and 
how we've managed to climb that production ramp, so that's looking great.
 
On a go
-
forward basis, the way we're thinking about margins is we certainly 
see opportunities for continued cost
-
downs, both on the e
ngineering front, 
also on the commercial front as well. We've got a supplier base that is very 
excited about the Model 3 and it's giving us the ability to leverage that on 
commercial cost downs, also continue manufacturing efficiencies. As we 
mentioned in 
shareholder letter, labor hours per car is trending quite 
positively right now and we're laser focused on continued improvement in 
that key metric.
 
All right next, talk about the cash position for a second. All right, here's one 
way to think about it. We e
nded up with $3.25 billion on the balance sheet 
at the end of the quarter. We started off the year 

 
on December 31, 2015, 
we had $1.2 billion. We raised $1.7 billion in our secondary offering and we 
collected on our Model 3 reservations. Therefore, we are
 
in a very healthy 
position from a cash perspective.
 
Couple different factors here to talk about. One, we've got $678 million 
drawn on our asset
-
backed line. This is something that we've talked about in 
the past. That is definitely backed up by our operati
ons. Two things there. 
One, approximately 5,000 cars in transit to customers at quarter end, so 
we're financing our FGI and we're monetizing our direct lease portfolio. 
Second factor on the cash position that we'd like to highlight is our 
continued CapEx d
iscipline. As we talked about in Q1, we had $217 million of 
CapEx in that quarter; in this quarter $295 million of CapEx. We compare 
that to averaging nearly $400 million a quarter throughout 2015. We're 
actually very pleased with these results and we're c
omfortable that we aren't 
doing anything to adversely impact our future.
 
On a go
-
forward basis, thinking about CapEx efficiency, you've heard Elon 
talk a lot about the machine that makes the machine. A big part of that is 
focusing on volumetric efficiency.
 
In our call on Monday, I talked about how 
when we started to review a lot of the Model 3 CapEx plans across the 
company, there were a bunch of new buildings everywhere. And the reaction 
to that was, wait a second, we've actually got a nice facilities foot
print 
already and how can we just densify those facilities and not have to invest 
further in this area? And we're starting to see a lot of that take hold now.
 
Second, I think we're making an attempt to crush the conventional wisdom 
that capacity increases 
only happen in step change increments and the 
capital that follows that in step change increments as well. And to put a little 
bit more color on that, there are many ways to optimize our current 
operations. The way to think about this is we can just drive 
greater 
throughput through the same investments. So, that's our cash position.
 
Finally, I'd just like to talk for a minute about expense management. In 
addition to our efforts on CapEx efficiency, we're also very focused on OpEx 
discipline. This quarter, S
G&A would have been flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter in 
spite of our continued expansion in service and sales, were it not for the 
payroll taxes we paid on our CEO's options exercises. SG&A was up $19 
million quarter
-
over
-
quarter on a non
-
GAAP basis. $17 million 
of that was 
the payroll expense associated with those option exercises. R&D now does 
continue to increase as we continued to march towards the Model 3 launch 
and continued to invest in our future. This is as predicted and as we've 
signaled in the past.
 
So 
to wrap it all up, we're very happy with the gross margin expansion in 
the quarter and we have increased our emphasis on OpEx discipline and 
CapEx efficiency. We believe our Q2 results reflect that and we're not 
backing down as we move forward.

Great. Thank you, Jason. All right. Latif, let's go to the first question please.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan 
Stanley. Yo
ur line is open. Mr. Jonas, please make sure your line isn't 
muted, and if you're on a speakerphone, lift your handset.
 
Neel N. Mehta 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Oh, sorry. It was muted. I'm going to ask this question on behalf of Adam 
Jonas. He had to drop
 
off the call. This is Neel Mehta. This is coming directly 
from him. Elon, you have explained the strategic rationale for having 
SolarCity and Tesla Motors join in a combined company. When we think of 
SpaceX, is there any conceivable strategic rationale fo
r Tesla Motors and 
Tesla Energy, or Tesla Solar, to work closely with the efforts of space 
exploration? And when we're thinking about this, we're thinking proprietary 
lower orbit satellite network to enhance the connected autonomous car 
ecosystem. So, yeah
, just wanted to get your thoughts on that, first of all, 
and I have a follow
-
up as well.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yeah, I don't think there's a strong product rationale to combine SpaceX and 
Tesla whereas there is for Tesla an
d SolarCity. It's really quite tenuous for 
SpaceX and Tesla. And there's a little cooperation that happens between the 
companies, but it's not that would justify merging them into one entity.
 
Neel N. Mehta 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Got it. And can you als
o give us an update on Tesla's proprietary mapping 
initiatives?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
I think we would prefer to be confidential in that regard. It would be...
 
Jason S. Wheeler

Chief Financial Officer
 
All right. Latif, let
's go to the next question.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
But what we've said thus far is that there's need to have much higher 
definition maps than currently exists anywhere in the world in order to have 
full autonomy. And we're in
 
the process of building those and I think making 
good progress.
 
Neel N. Mehta

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Got it. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of 
Barclays. Your line is open.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Couple of questions very much tied 
to cash flow and the borrowing capacity. First is just around customer 
deposits, which were a source of cash in the quarter, but looked to be about 
$288 millio
n. As of May, you had 373,000
-
ish Model 3 preorders, which 
would imply about a $375 million inflow, or $373 million. Could you maybe 
walk us between that number and what the actual change in deposits were, 
and in particular, where did Model 3 preorders end
 
the quarter at?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. So in terms of thinking about the cash flow, yeah, you're doing your 
math correctly, but we also release deposits when we deliver cars. So, 
there's an inflow and there's an outflow there. An
d the deposits on the early 
Model X cars were larger than the later Model X cars as well, so that's one of 
the impacts there as well. In terms of the Model 3 reservations, the 373,000 
number that you referenced is what we've talked about when we did our 
se
condary offering. And we're sticking to that number in terms of disclosure.
 
Brian A. Johnson 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Okay. Second question around the shift from increased on
-
balance sheet 
captive lending. My quick calculations, if you go up 8% in the back
 
half off of 
your $50,000 guide, that seems to be at $100,000, about a $350 million 
cash need. Now admittedly, you're paying your 

 
actually it would be less 
with the cost of goods sold, call it $250 million, $280 million. Are you going 
to finance that out
 
of your ABL? How quickly can you get another lease 
partner? And what do the amendments to the credit agreement for SolarCity 
do to your ability to borrow against that for this captive financing?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. So in terms
 
of the 

 
the ABL is definitely available for some of that for 
sure and then the overall liquidity position gives us confidence that we'll be 
able to do this. At the same time, we do have many active discussions going 
on with other lease partners and we're
 
looking at other ways to do this as 
well. And I don't want to talk a lot about SolarCity on this call. That's not 
what it is, but they've got some pretty advanced capability and thinking 
through how to walk through this as well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson of 
Dougherty & Co. Your question, please.
 
Charlie Lowell Anderson 
-
 
Dougherty &
 
Co. LLC
 
Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. My first question is around the sharing 
of vehicles described in the updated master plan. So, if we're moving from 
5% to 10% utilization of the vehicle to some larger number, I wonder what 
you think the ramifi
cations of that might be on the number of cars that need 
to be produced every year. And then maybe the ramifications as it relates to 
the Supercharger if the cars are always driving around. And then I have a 
follow
-
up.

Well, I think the demand for autonomous cars will vastly outweigh the 
production capability. So it's more in our mind that the global fleet of 
vehicles is about 2.5 billion roughly and total new vehicle production per 
year is only about 10
0 million. So, the fleet is basically turning over every 
roughly 20, 25 years. So we would have to make some truly enormous 
number of autonomous vehicles for there to be any land saturation because 
it will basically be the only car anyone wants to buy.

Thanks. And then for my second question, I wonder if you could clarify 
comments made on the last call about inverter technology. You mentioned 
having some of the best in the world for power electronics. So I wonde
r if 
you could just comment if indeed that's the case that you will be making 
your own inverter, and if so, what would be the benefit to the overall system 
with your inverter technology versus what's used today?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architec
t and CEO
 
Yeah, there's no question Tesla's going to do integrated inverter. It's the 
logical thing to do. I think we've got the most advanced inverter engineering 
team in the world, and so it makes sense to, just as we do the inventers on 
vehicles, to do 
it with solar as well and have it in a very tight package at a 
cents per watt level that is I think probably twice as good as anyone else. I 
think maybe better than that.
 
So, that's like the obvious move there, and as part of what we're referring to 
as kin
d of an integrated product, I mean, if you place yourself in the 
consumer's shoes, you just want it to work. You don't want to know how it 
works. You don't care about the details. It's just got to work reliably, look 
good, not take up a ton of space, the b
uying process has got be easy. You 
can check up on it with the app on your phones. There's only one phone 
app. You want it to be easy. You want it to just work. You want it to be 
affordable. You want it to look good. So, that's what we're going to do.

Yeah, and I think, just to add to that, when power electronics work well, you 
really don't even notice them. I mean, no one thinks about...

So yeah. Our goal is...
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
And that's not... yeah.
 
Jason S. Wheeler

Chief Financial Officer
 
Our goal is to basically make them seamless, and make it, as Elon said, easy 
fo
r people to use so they don't have to worry about what an inverter is, how 
it works. It's just all integrated into one simple system. Just like it is in the 
car.

Most people don't even know what AC or DC is. If you ask, so what's DC 
current? Or, what's direct current? What's alternating current? They would 
not be able to tell you. A lot of people don't even know the difference 
between p
ower and energy. One's in kilowatts, another one's in kilowatt 
hours, and they don't need to know, like there's not a good reason for them 
to know. Stuff should just work and take care of itself.

Latif, next question?
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Your line is 
open.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give an update of 
the Model S demand? In th
e press release, you indicate Model S and Model X 
orders are up about 65% year
-
over
-
year. But if we look at deliveries and 
production of the Model S, it hasn't changed that much since Q4. And you're 
rolling out the lower
-
priced 60 kWh version. So if demand
 
is up so much, 
why offer a lower
-
priced model and why hasn't production really been up 
that much more?
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
President
-
Global Sales & Service, Tesla Motors, 
Inc.
 
So, it's Jon. I'll give you a little bit of color on the demand, which has been 
healthy for Model S in the second quarter and into the third quarter as well. 
As we mentioned in the shareholder letter, we didn't have cars in the 
European market with the new refresh until the last month of the quarter, 
but despite that, we had year
-
over
-
year growth in Model S demand. And we 
had some very healthy growth in the markets where we had cars in stores, 
so we had double digit growth in both North America and China, really 
healthy growth in both of those markets.
 
That growth has continued into th
e third quarter, but one of the reasons we 
introduced the 60 kWh was we saw more Model 3 demand than we 
anticipated. We talked about that last quarter, and a number of those 
reservation holders said to us, we'd love to be in a Tesla today if you could 
prov
ide a more affordable version of the Model S. Our battery technology 
allows us to do that, and so we introduced the 60 kWh. And that's generated 
demand out of a new market segment that is reaching down into that Model 
3 reservation holder territory and por
tends really good things for a future 
Model 3 demand, but it's opened up a very nice segment for us for Model S.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
People are not buying the base model. They're like, they buy the 60 kWh, 
and then they op
tion it up quite a bit. So it ends up having like an average 
sale price, like over $80,000, and then actually all the 60 kWh's actually 
have the 75 kWh capacity. It's just software limited. There's potential for 
them to upgrade it over time and certainly f
or the resale value of the car to 
be enhanced when it's returned to Tesla by unlocking the additional 15 
kilowatt hours of that factory capability.
 
So, I mean, I think in sort of a nutshell, one way to think about Tesla right 
now is that we're right around
 
2,000 cars a week and we're trying to balance 
the mix to be roughly half Model X and Model S. There are some variations 
depending upon regionality. Some parts of the world prefer more SUVs. 
Some prefer more sedans. And we do tend to batch up our cars. Thi
s is why 
occasionally you see nonsensical articles about Tesla's demand suddenly 
rising in some country or suddenly falling. It's got nothing do with that. It 
just happens to be when the ship arrived.
 
But a high
-
level overview is just we see demand being f
airly strong at an 
average of 2,000 cars a week and we're able to maintain production at that 
level, notwithstanding occasional supplier hiccups. And then hopefully, we 
can grow that a little bit towards the end of the quarter and then a little 
more in Q4.
 
And our aspiration that's unvarnished here, this is just what 
we're aiming to do internally is to do a little better than 2,000 a week in 
sales and deliveries in Q4, combined Model S and Model X. I feel fairly 
optimistic about achieving that goal. Yeah, I
 
think our core business is 
actually doing quite well right now.
 
Colin Michael Langan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Just as a follow up. Any update on stationary storage? I think your original 
target for $400 million to $500 million for this year and the $5 
million for 
next year, any just color on how that's trending?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Heavily engineering and production constraints. We've got some next
-
generation technology and we're going to split up that production line. 
So, 
it's going to be heavily concentrated in Q4 and probably even heavily in 
November and December. But I think it's going to be really exciting when 
people see it. So, that's why I expect kind of exponential growth from there. 
I think it's really going to
 
go ballistic.
 
Jonathan McNeill 
-
 
President
-
Global Sales & Service, Tesla Motors, 
Inc.
 
Yeah, and we have been making quite a few background investments in the 
markets where we're growing, setting up the teams and setting up to get 
ready for expanded produc
t installation and distribution, especially in places 
like Australia and Germany. So, some of that takes a bit of time but it's 
laying the infrastructure for faster growth.
 
Colin Michael Langan

Okay. Thanks very much.
 
Jeff Evanson

VP
 
Global Investor Relations, Tesla Motors, Inc.
 
All right. Latif, let's go to the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your 
question, please.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. 
(Broker)
 
As you look forward and without the residual value guarantee, can you talk 
about what's going to happen with the warranty expense on the vehicles?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Sure. So, I think the way to think about warra
nty, and we put this in the 
shareholder letter, our ongoing reserves is roughly consistent with what it's 
been, with what it was last quarter. And the RVG really doesn't have an 
impact on warranty expense. Really, warranty expense is all about reliability,
 
and reliability is something that we are constantly monitoring. And as we see 
positive things happen or things, they go in the other direction with 
reliability, that's how we think about the ongoing reserves for warranty.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., 
Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
So I don't think the 
-
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Okay. Yeah, yeah, I feel like the quality, I think, has improved quite 
dramatically, specifically with respect to Mo
del X. We had a lot of challenges 
in the production ramp. That's always the most difficult time when you're 
going from zero to 1,000 cars a week. It's just you've got to pull at this huge 
baggage train of suppliers along with you and you've got to solve a 
lot of 
issues internally so that production ramp is a lot of hurt. But now we're 
pretty stable at the 2,000 cars a week level. And every time we (22:42), it's 
getting better. So that each passing week gets better and better. And so I 
actually feel pretty g
ood about our warranty reserves actually declining over 
time as a result of that.
 
Colin Rusch 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay, great. And then my follow up is around Mobileye and the ending of 
that partnership and how you guys are going to approach
 
that functionality 
going forward with the driver assist in the autonomous driving push going 
forward.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
I think we'll have a more significant announcement on that later. So it's not 
really 

 
earnings cal
l is not the right time for that except that it will be a 
Tesla solution, internal solution.
 
Colin Rusch

Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of 
JPMorgan. Your line is open.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question, which I guess is really for Elon. As 
Tesla grows very quickly and becomes increasingly diversified going from 
just the Model S to recently include th
e Model X and now the Model 3 soon 
and you've added Tesla Energy to the mix; now SolarCity. So I'm really 
curious how you think about management focus and attention and what you 
and your team are going to be doing to ensure strong execution and focus 
as yo
u head into the very important and, by your own admission, very 
challenging launch of the Model 3.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Well, I think the Model 3 is overwhelmingly our focus. Yeah. Things feel 
really quite stable with Model
 
S and Model X. We're kind of in the mode of 
continuous improvement, but no fundamental issues. So, I feel like the 
machine that's making Model X and Model S is actually functioning quite well 
right now. And I definitely burn out of few neurons and a lot o
f other people 
did solving the production ramp earlier this year. I feel we're in a good place 
at this point. So, the focus really is on Model 3 and followed by full 
autonomy as 

 
well it's our two priorities.
 
Ryan Brinkman 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. 
And then the follow up is, as you're starting here in Q3 to ramp up the 
spending on both the Gigafactory and the Model 3 development capacity, et 
cetera, are you seeing that one or the other, the Model 3 or the retrofit of 
Model 3 (25:23) is providing more
 
or less potential bottlenecks than the 
other in terms of getting to that July 1 Model 3 launch?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
I don't actually know of any 

 
there's not any one standout issue for July 1. 
Now, I did say this on the 
last earnings call and I think it probably bears 
reiterating because 

 
and I think it makes sense if you think about it, but it 
does require a bit of thinking about it. I don't expect us to be at full 
production on July 1, but I have to drive all suppliers
 
and internal efforts to 
that date, knowing that some will fall short. And those that fall short, the 
suppliers that fall short will be cut out of the picture. And if there are teams 
internally that fail to execute effectively, we will reorganize those tea
ms.
 
But if several thousand parts are not driven to a particular date, there is no 
chance of making any point even past that date. Now in an ideal world, this 
would be a confidential internal 

 
do I want to a confidential internal 

 
July 1 
will be a confid
ential internal target. Given the amount of attention that 
Tesla receives and the fact there are several or if you count two to three, 
three and four suppliers, there's several thousand companies involved. It is 
obviously impossible to keep that confidenti
al. You can't. So then in order to 
have a consistent message, internally knowing that that message will also 
leak externally that's where the July 1 date comes from. There isn't any 
other way to do it. If anybody's got better suggestions, I'd like to hear 
what 
they are. So I expect production to occur at some point after July 1, but I 
don't know what today would cause us to slip past that date. And if I did, I 
would take action to address it.

Elon Reeve Musk

Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America. 
Your line is open.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Good afternoon. The first question
 
is, as we think about the 60 kilowatt
-
hour 
versions of the Model S and Model X, I'm just curious if you could talk about 
the profitability of those right now versus the other models or the corporate 
average as you see it?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financia
l Officer
 
Yes, sure. So...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Well...
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Go ahead, Elon.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yes, so I was going to say, because people are optioni
ng up the 60 kilowatt
-
hour, it actually ends up being decent. Maybe it's sort of like 15% to 20% 
gross margin where I say something like if somebody orders a Performance 
Dual Motor that might actually be more like a 30%, 35% gross margin. But 
there's just 
a small number of people that want high
-
performance cars and 
are willing to pay triple digits 

 
six digits I should say. But it also remains to 
be seen how many who order the 60 kilowatt
-
hour then choose to do the 
upgrade to the 75 kilowatt
-
hour rate. So t
here's going be some number, but 
it's too early to tell, of people who buy the 60 kilowatt
-
hour, realize they 
want the extra range and then they can just order it kind of like an in
-
app 
purchase on the car screen and unlock it.
 
I suspect we'll see pretty d
ecent number of people do that. But it's still very 
early, so it's hard to say what number that would be. And if they do do that, 
then it would push the gross margins up into the 20%s, like in the mid
-
20%s or so.
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch
 
That's helpful. And then just, Jason, maybe two quick housekeeping 
questions. CapEx at $2.25 billion, you're running at a run rate that's less 
than half after the first half of the year. So just curious how realistic that 
number is for the fu
ll year because you guys have committed to it in the 
Shareholder Letter again. Then also the auto gross margin going up 200 
basis points to 300 basis points off of what base? It's not clear what base 
that's coming off of. Just trying to understand the exit
 
gross margin for the 
year you're expecting.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes, sure. No problem. So I'm going to add just a little bit of color onto the 
60 kilowatt
-
hour gross margin numbers, too. We're aspirational on this. But 
the way to th
ink about this is very important. Those cars are gross margin 
positive and they're producing cash. So if you think about from an overall 
operating leverage perspective, even if the gross margin profile on those is 
less than our other variants, it's still p
roducing contribution margin to pay 
for the fixed cost of the business. So I think it's the right economic thing to 
do. And even more importantly, it's right for the customer to continue to 
broaden the market that way.
 
On your two housekeeping questions, g
ood questions. On the CapEx front, 
as you heard in my opening comments, we are deadly focused on CapEx 
efficiency. So I think we can beat the $2.25 billion number, but we didn't see 
any need to update that guidance at this time. And then your question abou
t 
gross margin on the basis, I was just looking at the quarter
-
over
-
quarter. In 
Q1 automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits was 20.1% and we 
expanded that to 21.9% in Q2. And it's expansion on both the Model X and 
the Model S variants.
 
John J. Murphy
 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
But the 2 points to 3 points of expansion in Q3 and Q4 is off the 21.9% base 
in second quarter?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
I see you're asking about the forward...
 
John J. Murphy 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Ly
nch
 
Yes.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
...the forward
-
looking. Yes, so we expect where we're at today, we'll see 
another 2 points to 3 points expansion between now and the end of the 
year.
 
John J. Murphy

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. 
Thank you very much.
 
Jason S. Wheeler

Yes, sure. No problem.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC 
Capital Markets. Your line is open.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. Good af
ternoon. Jason, just first question to follow
-
up on that last 
one. So even 2 points to 3 points on gross margin sequentially, that seems 
below the prior guidance, which I think called for 30% to exit the year on 
the Model S and 25% on Model X. So is it rel
ated to the updated mix view 
on the 60 kilowatt
-
hour? Was there something else going on or what's the 
source of the change?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes, no, a couple things there, and our previous guidance has been 
approaching 25% on Mod
el X and approaching 30% on Model S. So I think 
we're maybe a quarter or two off on that, but you're pointing to the right 
things. One is just the mix shift that we're seeing with more Model Xs being 
produced and those margins are healthy and headed in the
 
right direction, 
but they are obviously less than Model S. And now that we're halfway 
through the year two, we've talked a lot about just the production issues 
we've had overall. And this certainly had an impact on the first half of the 
year and it's just
 
difficult to make up for all of that in the next six months. 
And then the impact, you talk about the 60s kilowatt
-
hour. The 60s kilowatt
-
hour may I have somewhat of a impact on gross margin?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Pretty sma
ll, though.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Pretty small, yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yes, it's pretty small. But I'm cautiously optimistic that we will actually meet 
those numbers by the end of the year. Maybe not for Q4 as a whole. But 
exiting Q4, my best guess is we're just under 30% for Model S and around 
25% for Model X by the end of t
his year. That's what it looks like to me.
 
Joseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. And then, Elon, just as a philosophical question, as you transition to 
an in
-
house autopilot or autonomous solution, would you consider, in order 
to help build public su
pport and confidence about releasing regular reports 
similar to what Google does on what the technology is doing and open the 
data?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Well, unfortunately and fortunately, Tesla cannot sneeze without there
 
being 
a national headline. So I think you don't have to worry too much about 
whether we'll report it because the media will and then inflate it in size by 
1,000. Like last year there were 35,000 automotive deaths in the U.S. How 
many did you read about?
 
J
oseph Spak 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Right. I guess maybe instead of public support, what about regulator 
support? What are your views on sharing the data in that respect?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Actually, with the regulators 
we share the data well in advance of 

 
as soon 
as we know it. We shared the data regarding, say, the Florida fatality like a 
month, certainly weeks before and NHTSA actually opened investigation. In 
fact, we're not totally clear on why they opened the inve
stigation, because 
they actually had all the information before they made a formal 
investigation. Like I said, it was a little puzzling as to why they 

 
we would 
have already given them all the information. So there wasn't really anything 
more to learn.

Edge Research. Your line is open.
 
James J. Albertine

Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for ta
king the questions. Real 
quick, a housekeeping item. I've heard and we saw obviously in the second 
quarter there was some lumpiness in the production and you ended up, I 
think, with 50 vehicles,100 vehicles or so in transit at the end of the quarter. 
But I
've heard Elon and Jason say stable or stabilization here a few times in 
the call. Just wanted to get a sense for how we should be thinking about the 
back
-
half deliveries and back
-
half expenses. Should it be relatively linear 
from here as we work toward, f
or example, your 30% year
-
over
-
year 
expense guidance? Thanks.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes, sure...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yes, I mean, sorry, I would also like to say a few words and Jason can 
address it. Basically, we were in production hell for the first six months of 
this year. Man, it was hell. And then we just managed to climb out of hell in 
like basically partway through June. And now the production line is humming 
and our suppliers mostly
 
have their shit together. There's a few that don't. 
One I'm going to be visiting on Saturday personally to figure out what the 
hell's going on there. But we'll solve it. But just the thing that's crazy hard 
about cars is that there's several thousand uniq
ue items and you move as 
fast as the slowest item in the whole car.
 
So, yes, with that said, production is like, it feels like we're 

 
I'm not losing 
sleep at night literally because of production issues right now. 2,000 feels 
like a good number with a slo
w, steady increase in that number, and then 
continued cost efficiencies, which help with gross margin, some features that 
are going to come out that will also help on the revenue side. And I feel 
actually really good about Model S and Model X right now, bu
t I'll get a 
whole lot of mental scar tissue from first six months of this year. Jason?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes, I think, Elon, I think you covered it well. In terms of the modeling 
question, yes, I think just extrapolating from wher
e we're at now, we're 
stable. We'll continue to get better on production throughout the course of 
the year. We've got a couple more holiday weeks in Q4. You might want to 
think about that when you're doing your modeling. But, yes, I think Elon 
covered it w
ell.
 
James J. Albertine

Consumer Edge Research LLC

Elon Reeve Musk

And also to...
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Oh, sorry.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product

...steady improvements in 

 
almost every week, we see an improvement in 
labor hours per car, which is great from a cost standpoint. Also the Tesla 
production team has been working super hard and we don't want to burn 
people out, so it's g
ood to see the hours per car come down almost every 
week as a sign of improved efficiency.
 
James J. Albertine 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research LLC
 
Very good. I appreciate the additional color. If I may just sneak in a quick 
follow
-
up on the autonomy topic. Elon, a
s we think about the stages of 
autonomy, I believe NHTSA's outlined five stages or zero to five. And we've 
seen some competitors of yours outline with some detail 2017 to 2020 to 
2022 type targets. How should we think about your target? And can you help 
us
 
dimension a little bit more your targets in the path to level five? Let's 
assume for the moment that nothing's changed and given the accident in 
May, and if it has incrementally, that'd be helpful. But just wanted to 
understand in more detail I think how 
you plan to get to fully autonomous. 
Thanks.

Well, again, major product announcements are not 

 
I shouldn't do those on 
an earnings call, obviously. And all I'd say is that full autonomy is going to 
com
e a hell of a lot faster than anyone thinks it will. And I think what we've 
got under development is going to blow people's minds. It blows my mind, 
so.

Thank you. Our next questio
n comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is open.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thanks. I had a couple things. One is just following up on Tesla Energy, can 
you talk a little bit about the business pipeline, what's the mi
x of customers 
you're selling your product to? And is there a significant contingent of solar? 
And I wasn't clear on 

 
there was an earlier question on whether the 
business is still tracking to around $500 million this year. Could you just 
elaborate on tha
t business line?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yes, it's heavily dependent on the production ramp in the last few months of 
the year. So there's definitely nothing even remotely close to demand 
constraints on the Tesla Energy side. 
It's entirely getting the engineering 
done, getting it validated, getting UL certification, scaling up all elements of 
the supply chain and being able to produce in volume.
 
So the reason it's tricky to predict is because the volume ramp looks like an 
expon
ential and so if you move the dates around even a little bit, it can 
quite significantly change what occurs in a quarter just because the 
production ramp is an exponential and shifts up a couple weeks, it can make 
the quarter look low, but actually it's in
 
vertical climb mode. So the following 
quarter will look amazing. So what I'm highly confident of is that the next 
generation of stationary charge is head and shoulders above anything else 
that I've even heard announced as future plans from other companies
.
 
Rod Lache

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. It's...
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
So we've just got to build those damn things.
 
Rod Lache

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Yes, the customers that you're anticipating, are there
 
significant renewables 
in there? Is it commercial, residential?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Yes.
 
Rod Lache

What are you seeing?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Everything.
 
Rod Lache

All of the above? Okay.
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yes.
 
Rod Lache

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
And...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
We've just got
 
to scale up production, and production is a hard thing. It's 
real hard.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Particularly when it's new technology. If it's some standard technology to 
make f
or one time, it's fine. It's cutting edge technology, it's really hard to 
scale up production, because you've got to design the machine that makes 
the machine, not just the machine itself. But the results can be amazing. 
Like I said, it's going be head and
 
shoulders above anything else. It's better 
than anything I've heard anyone even announce that they will do in near 
future, and we will do it in the present.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thanks. And on the topic of production, you've said som
e really interesting 
things about step
-
function changes in automotive manufacturing and 
improving the volumetric efficiency.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yes, absolutely.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Typically, as I'm
 
sure you know, the bottlenecks in auto manufacturing are 
really not in the automated functions like the body shop. They're in things 
like final trim and assembly that are more labor
-
intensive, when you've got 
people crawling in and out of vehicles. Do you
 
see a significant step
-
function 
improvement there like inside out manufacturing...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yes.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
...or something like that? Is that something that we're going to see o
n the 
Model 3?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
The Model 3 

 
the internal name for designing the machine makes the 
machine is the 

 
we call it the alien dreadnought. At the point at which the 
factory looks like an alien 
dreadnought, then you know you've won. It's like, 
what the hell is that? So we've got alien dreadnought version 0.5 will be 
Model 3. It will take us another year get to version 1 and probably a major 
version every two years thereafter. By version 3, it won
't look like anything 
else. It might look like a giant chip pick
-
and
-
place machine or a super high
-
speed bottling or canning plant, and you really can't have people in the 
production line itself. Otherwise you'll automatically drop to people speed. 
There's
 
still a lot of people at the factory, but what they're doing is 
maintaining the machines, upgrading them, dealing with anomalies. But in 
the production process itself there essentially would be no people.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Yes.
 
El
on Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
With version 1, not version 0.5. But I don't want people to think, oh, Tesla's 
going to have a factory without people. It's going be a huge number of 
people, but they will be maintaining machines and upgr
ading the machines 
and dealing with anomalies. And the output per person will be 
extraordinarily high.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Sounds like a lot of innovation there. One last just housekeeping thing for 
Elon or Jason. You'd previously ta
lked about the objective of profitability in 
the fourth quarter, but I know a lot's changing with the mix and also with 
the direct leasing. So is that also something that we should think as being 
pushed out a quarter?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Ar
chitect and CEO
 
Well, if you exclude Model 3 CapEx ramp, then 

 
well in fact, really for Q3 
and for Q4, Tesla would be profitable excluding the Model 3 CapEx ramp.
 
Rod Lache 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next que
stion comes from Pat Archambault of Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is open.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Terrific. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just an accounting question 
maybe for Jason. With the residual value guarantee going away, wha
t 
happens to the accounting for revenues? Do you get to something more 
close to what we see in other OEM financials, and maybe just have the 
portion that's direct lease be accounted for as leases? And what would be 
the timing of changes assuming they do ha
ppen?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes, no. Absolutely, and the answer to timing of changes is right away. So a 
car that is sold without an 

 
so with an RVG that drops us into lease 
accounting. And what we've done historically and we'll conti
nue to do for 
RVGs is we recognize the full revenue on a non
-
GAAP basis. What changes 
when there's not an RVG in the equation is you get full revenue recognition 
on a GAAP basis as well as a non
-
GAAP basis. So good things happen on the 
accounting side.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Okay. And then this is something that within the next quarter or something 
you'll already see a significant reduction in that adjustment obviously.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
You'll see that but the
 
other thing I want to point you to is what we've 
already talked about in uptake in direct leasing. When we have used a 
partner in the past for leasing that gives us non
-
GAAP revenue recognition 
on that. Our non
-
GAAP revenue recognition is very simply call
ed the cash. If 
somebody pays us cash for a car, we recognize it in non
-
GAAP revenue. 
When we do direct leasing, then that drops us into pure lease accounting. So 
it will be that way on a GAAP and a non
-
GAAP basis.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
And is the 8% to 15% is that just kind of a temporary measure while you're 
setting up these new partner relationships? Or do you actually expect to stay 
at 15% for some time?
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
So 15% is what we're talking about fo
r Q3 and I think I mentioned earlier 
we've got a bunch of active conversations with new partners. There's 
another factor too, which is I think important to point out. We've introduced 
some pretty compelling loan programs, particularly in North America, in 
the 
last 90 days, and we're starting to see some shift from leasing towards 
loans. And to bring the answer to your question full circle, loan is full GAAP 
and full non
-
GAAP revenue recognition.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Got it. That's helpf
ul. And I think it'll be helpful for just the users of financial 
statements as well. The ZEV credits, you mentioned that they weren't 
material. I feel like it's been written that there was kind of a glut of supply 
on those. And I don't know, is that just t
he lumpiness of it or is that a 
revenue process of going away?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Well, yes, actually if I could say something and I'd really want to emphasize 
this quite strongly and I hope it does get picked up in the media is that the 
California Air Resources Board is being incredibly weak in its application of 
ZEV credits. The stand
ards are pathetically low. They need to be increased. 
There's massive lobbying by the big car companies to prevent CARB from 
increasing the ZEV credits mandate, which they absolutely damn well 
should. It's a crying shame that they haven't. And as a result,
 
you can 
barely sell the ZEV credit for pennies on the dollar.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Got it. Okay. So...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
CARB should damn well be ashamed of themselves.
 
Patrick Archambault 
-
 
Goldman
 
Sachs & Co.
 
All right. No, I think that answers my question pretty directly then. The last 
one, just one housekeeping one. Any chance, and sorry, if I missed it, ex
-
production for the quarter, are you able to share that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk

Chairman, Produc
t Architect and CEO
 
We haven't worked on. Yeah.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah.
 
Patrick Archambault

Okay. I think that was a no, but fair enough. Those were my questions. I'll

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick follow up, I guess, on 
something that's bee
n asked a couple of times; take another run at it. I 
guess given that you're obviously no longer working with this key supplier 
around full autonomy. What are the major hurdles that you see for Tesla 
here to overcome to get to full autonomy? Is it just a c
ase of software 
development, lots more miles driven and basically getting the right people in 
place? Any color on sort of some of the key challenges you're facing and 
where you're particularly focused for delivering full autonomy at some point? 
Thanks.
 
Elo
n Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Well, full autonomy is really a software limitation. I mean the hardware is 
just to create full autonomy, so it's really about developing advanced, 
narrow AI for the car to operate on. I want to emphasize 
narrow AI, it's like 
not going to take over the world, but it needs to be really good at driving a 
car. So increasingly sophisticated neural maps that can operate in 
reasonably sized computers in the car. That's our focus. I'm very optimistic 
about this. I
t's exciting, it blows me away, the progress we're making. So I 
think if I'm this close to it and it's blowing me away, it's really going to blow 
other people away when they see it for the first time.

Your line is open.
 
Emmanuel Ro

CLSA Americas LLC
 
Hi, everybody. I wanted to ask just a couple of questions on the update to 
the master plan. The first one is on the sharing piece. So definitely a very 
exciting goal. At the same time, I feel like a lot of automakers as well as 
municipalities are all working on their version of ride sharing through 
autonomous driverless cars, and to the extent that a lot of what buyers are 
looking at in Tesla now is the driving experience, and that it really doesn't 
matter as much when you're bei
ng driven. What do you view as your future 
competitive advantage in a ride sharing type of environment?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
I think the quality of the ride is always going to matter, and yeah, nobody 
wants to drive if you'
re sitting in stop
-
and
-
go traffic. That's boring. But if 
you're driving on a beautiful country road or along the seaside, then I think 
it feels wonderful to drive, and you want to do that. So I don't think cars are 
going to just become some boring utility.
 
Emmanuel Rosner 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Got it. And I guess on the piece about expanding the product lineup to other 
major segments, what do you view as your target timing for that? I know 
there was a mention of some of these cars being available to be unveil
ed 
next year. So does that mean that we're looking at the following year? Or is 
that into the next decade? And what capital needs are we looking at for 
that?
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
I think we want to postpone anything that's 
a heavy capital impact until 
after the Model 3 production is ramped. We don't want to stack Model 3 
CapEx on top of other program CapEx, but there's a lot we can do. Because 
the development of a vehicle, there's a long sort of tail at the beginning of a 
de
velopment of a vehicle which involves a lot of time, but doesn't involve a 
lot of cost. It's only when you begin tooling up for production that the cost 
really ramps dramatically.
 
So there's a lot we can do before we actually dive into ramp CapEx, and we 
w
on't do that for any products until after Model 3's in high production. Yeah, 
but I think there's going be some pretty exciting unveils for the Tesla Semi 
and Tesla Minibus or bus. We don't actually have a name for it yet. That's 
just off of the Model X pl
atform, so just doesn't involve a lot of CapEx 
actually.
 
But we expect to probably unveil those, I think, for the middle of next year, 
maybe in the next six months to nine months type of thing, and then have a 
better, a more fleshed out plan for when those
 
would enter production. But 
they would enter production within like low single
-
digit years, not like 

 
I 
mean I consider like anything past five years as infinity.
 
Emmanuel Rosner 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
All right. That's very helpful.
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chair
man, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yeah. I mean, also to be clear like the priority vehicle development after the 
Model 3 would be the Model Y, I guess, the compact SUV, because that's 
also a car that where we expect to see demand in the 500,000 to 1,000,000 
u
nit per year level. So it's the obvious priority after the Model 3.

Tyler Charles Frank

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth 
Management)
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two short questi
ons. One, can you 
discuss when you expect to be profitable on a non
-
GAAP basis? And then 
number two, you had mentioned on the last call that the Gigafactory may 
actually have the ability to produce about three times of your original 
estimate. Will that ent
ail significant CapEx in the future, or are you 
preparing that foundation right now to reach over 100 gigawatt hours? 
Thank you.
 
Jason S. Wheeler 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, sure. On the profitability question, just reiterate what Elon said earlier. 
If
 
we can execute on our production and our delivery goals in the second 
half of the year, we got a great chance to be non
-
GAAP profitable. So...
 
Elon Reeve Musk 
-
 
Chairman, Product Architect and CEO
 
Yeah, excluding Model 3 CapEx. The real question on profit
ability is where do 
we set the dial on growth? And obviously, if you set the dial on growth to be 
super high, then you face dilution because of that increased capital. If you 
set it too low, there's less dilution but then you grow slower. So you want to 
se
t it at the right level where your 

 
the right mix of dilution and growth. I 
mean, as it is, it's just important to bear in mind, like as a manufacturing 
company, our percentage growth, I think it's unprecedented in the modern 
era. It's really nutty.
 
I mea
n, in 2010, we were making 600 cars a year and Lotus was doing the 
chassis, body and chassis. And then five years later, we are making 50,000. 
And it was a much more sophisticated car with Model X and we were doing 
the whole car without any partner. So whe
n you have like an insane 
percentage growth like that in the manufacturing company, it's not like 
you're shipping copies of software here, it's a real tricky strategic business 
to, where do you set things from a solution versus growth standpoint?
 
So, I mea
n, the right way to look at the product line 

 
the company's 

 
let's 
just say the product line and say and value them as 

 
sort of do an NPV of 
the product lines. And then for any given product line you can say, okay, 
this is what that is likely to be wort
h. The Model S, the Model X, the Model 3 
and then you can parse it out relative to the CapEx on new vehicles.
 
And to the degree that the past predicts the future, then you can pretty 
much count on like the new vehicle program also being incredibly valuable
 
and something where it would be mad not to spend the money to do it. But 
when all of that's lumped together can be confusing. And then they will think 
Tesla's a money
-
losing company but well, not really. Not if you're growing at 
like 100% a year or in the
 
case of next year, I mean our unit volume 

 
we'll 
probably exit next year at unit volume that's 200% or 300% what our 
current volume is, maybe 400%.
 
So it's just real important to parse things out and to understand what the 
real health of the 
business is. Right now, I mean in a nutshell, we're 
shipping $10 billion a year of product on an annualized basis at somewhere 
around 23% to 25% gross margin.

And just quickly to your Gigafactory question, this is JB. A lot of the 
improvements that we've made are actually increasing the density of the 
Gigafactory.
 
Tyler Charles Frank

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealt
h

Yeah.
 
Jeffrey B. Straubel

And the density of how much equipment and (1:02:19) the existing 
footprint. So in that case, there's a lot of investments we've already made: 
preparing the site, some of the infrastructure 
for the site that we would get 
to continue leveraging as we grow capacity even higher than our original 
plan. There would be some other investments, of course, and equipment and 
things like that. They would be incremental tied to that much higher 
volumes, 
those would also be enabling vehicle volumes and energy product 
volumes way beyond what we'd initially predicted.
